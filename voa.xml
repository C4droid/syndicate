        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Chipmakers Celebrate End of Chip Surplus  (2023/8/2)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">01 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>From Intel in the United States to South Korea's Samsung, producers are celebrating the beginning of the end of the <strong>chip</strong> surplus. Still, the expectations for demand from buyers outside the artificial intelligence (AI) industry remain weak.</p>
<p><strong>Chip markets </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Semiconductor chips are seen on a circuit board of a computer in this illustration picture taken February 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fa918b34-78cb-4d29-8251-7f8024695932_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Semiconductor chips are seen on a circuit board of a computer in this illustration picture taken February 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration)</span></div>
<p>All the major markets for chips - smartphones, computers and data centers - have decreased this year. Both companies and people have reduced spending during a weak international economy, high inflation and rising interest rates.</p>
<p>The decreased demand has created a large oversupply of chips. The result: a record combined $12 billion first-half operating loss for the world's two largest memory chipmakers, Samsung and SK Hynix of South Korea.</p>
<p>This time of oversupply, however, has started to ease. Chip companies have cut production. And a decline in personal computer shipments eased to 11 percent in the June <strong>quarter</strong> compared to a 30 percent decrease in each of the previous two quarters, data from the research company Canalys showed.</p>
<p>The smartphone market is also looking better, with cellphone shipments falling 8 percent in the June quarter, versus 14 percent in the first quarter, says research firm Counterpoint.</p>
<p>"Demand is recovering very <strong>gradually</strong>," Woohyun Kim, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said on an earnings call last week.</p>
<p>Intel chief Pat Gelsinger recently said an oversupply in server central processing units (CPUs) will continue until the second half of the year. He also said that data center chip sales will decline in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>A slow recovery in China, the world's biggest chip buyer, is also lowering market expectations.</p>
<p>Both Samsung and SK Hynix said China's reopening failed to live up to expectations that it would bring back the smartphone market. The two companies said they were lengthening production cuts of NAND memory chips, widely used in smartphones to store digital data.</p>
<p>American chipmaker Texas Instruments, which does a lot of business in China, predicted third-quarter earnings and profit below targets last week.</p>
<p>"China was roughly half of sales at the end of fiscal 2022, so China has the largest impact on TI's (Texas Instruments) business," said Logan Purk of the investment business Edward Jones.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence </strong></p>
<p>Demand for chips to support generative artificial intelligence has increased since OpenAI's ChatGPT was launched late last year. Still, AI only accounts for a small amount of overall chip demand.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of the equipment used to make chips such as KLA Corporation and Lam Research in the U.S. are early winners of the AI boom. Both companies predicted quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates last week.</p>

<p>At about summer's halfway point, scientists say the world's record-breaking heat and weather extremes are both <strong>unprecedented</strong> and unsurprising.</p>
<p>American and European <strong>meteorologists</strong> also expect a hotter-than-normal August and September.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People swim in the ocean off of Crandon Park, July 28, 2023, in Key Biscayne, Fla (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5d9b-08db92b37b70_cx19_cy21_cw80_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - People swim in the ocean off of Crandon Park, July 28, 2023, in Key Biscayne, Fla (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)</span></div>
<p>Gavin Schmidt is a NASA climate scientist. He told <em>The Associated Press,</em> "The heat waves that we're seeing in the U.S. and in Europe, in China are <strong>demolishing</strong> records left, right and center. This is not a surprise."</p>
<p>"We're going to be seeing this pretty much this year and into next year," Schmidt said. Along with human-caused climate change, there is also the natural El Nino warming of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Here is a look at what has happened so far this summer:</p>
<p><strong>Record-breaking heat</strong></p>
<p>The month of June this year was the hottest June on record in the world. Scientists say July has been so hot that even before the month was over they could say it was the hottest month on record. In some places, the heat has been deadly.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Arizona, the last day of June and each day of July has been at least 43 degrees Celsius. The area also set records for the longest period with temperatures at 32 and higher.</p>
<p>El Paso, Texas, had 44 days of 37-degree heat. Schools closed in Nuevo Leon state in northern Mexico a month earlier than normal as temperatures reached 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Beijing, China experienced 27 days of 35 degrees in July. That came after three 40-degree days in June.</p>
<p>Heat records fell all over southern Europe. Sardinia, Italy, hit 47 degrees. Palermo in Sicily broke a record that goes back to 1791 by 2 degrees.</p>
<p>Spain reported nearly 1,000 extra deaths from the heat by mid-July, mostly among older people.</p>
<p><strong>Too much rain</strong></p>
<p>More than 10,000 people had to be <strong>evacuated</strong> in central Hunan province in China. Heavy rainfall there caused at least 70 houses to collapse. In Yichang, rain caused a landslide that buried a construction site and killed at least one person.</p>
<p>Australia's Queensland desert got 13 times its normal monthly July rain in just one day.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were evacuated from Delhi in India as rains caused floods and landslides. Heavy rain and flooding caused several deaths in northeastern states of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Wildfires and smoke</strong></p>
<p>Too little rain in Greece and Spain worsened wildfires. In the Canary Islands, a fire caused 4,000 people to evacuate and 400 firefighters battling it.</p>
<p>Hot and dry conditions caused about 160 wildfires to break out in Israel in early June.</p>
<p>In northern Quebec, Canada, wildfire smoke spread to create the world's dirtiest air in cities like New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>As of late July, more than 600 wildfires were out of control in Canada. A record 123,000 square kilometers burned, and fire season is not nearly done. That is an area larger than North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>Water temperatures</strong></p>
<p>Water temperatures in the Florida Keys and off the Everglades hit the high 30s.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic had hot spots that alarmed scientists. The world's oceans as a whole were the hottest ever in June and got even hotter in July. In Antarctica, sea ice broke record-low levels.</p>
<p>Ocean temperatures take a long time to warm up and cool down, said Victor Gensini who teaches meteorology at the University of Northern Illinois. He added that it does not look good for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>A hot forecast</strong></p>
<p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Rosencrans expects above normal temperatures for the next three months.</p>
<p>The only possible relief he sees, especially in the hot Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, is if a <strong>hurricane</strong> or tropical storm moves through. But the height of hurricane season in September has not even started.</p>
<p>With the summer's weather extremes so far, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann had one question: "How on God's Earth are we still burning <strong>fossil fuels</strong> after witnessing all this?"</p>

            <title>Bhutanese Youth Look to Australia for a Better Life  (2023/8/2)</title>

<p>Young people are leaving Bhutan as Australia has reopened its borders to international students after the pandemic. Young people from Bhutan are seeking opportunities outside the country as more are becoming unhappy with the South Asian kingdom's economy.</p>
<p>The number of students arriving in Australia from Bhutan has increased sharply. Over 12,000 arrived during the 11 months ending in May. That number represents about 1.5 percent of the small South Asian country's population. The country has a youth unemployment rate above 25 percent.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Buddha Dordenma statue overlooks the town of Thimphu, Bhutan, April 16, 2016.

(REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>Most of the recent arrivals have settled in Perth, Western Australia. They are taking classes in fields like childcare, <strong>hospitality</strong>, and accounting.</p>
<p>Tashi Kipchu is 25 years old. He is one of many who came to Australia last year in search of better <strong>opportunities</strong>.</p>
<p>"Right after COVID, everything died," said Kipchu, who studied marketing at the University of Western Australia. He said he did not see any opportunities at home.</p>
<p>Bhutanese students did not start going to Australia until 2017. The number sharply increased after Australia reopened its borders in 2022. Australian government data shows that the number of Bhutanese students asking for visas increased by five times in the financial year ending in June.</p>
<p>The increase of student arrivals has made Australia home to one of the largest Bhutanese communities outside of South Asia.</p>
<p>Bhutanese students represent just a small part of Australia's 600,000 international student population. But the increase of students comes as the $27 billion education industry in Australia tries to make up lost ground from the decrease during the pandemic. Students from China, for example, are returning at a slower rate than Australian officials had hoped.</p>
<p>Phil Honeywood is Chief Executive Officer at International Education Association of Australia. He said Australian universities want to <strong>diversify</strong>. Honeywood said they got the message from the former and current government that they should not depend too much on China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>Sonam Tobgay is Bhutan's ambassador to Australia. He said students want to go to Australia for a less costly education and visas that permit students' dependents to work for unlimited hours.</p>
<p>Bhutan's mostly closed economy is dependent on hydropower and <strong>tourism</strong>. Its economy has more recently been hurt by high energy costs and limited trade.</p>
<p>Government reforms have added to the number of working professionals leaving.</p>
<p>Found between India and China, Bhutan reopened its borders last September. But higher taxes on tourism have slowed the country's recovery. Youth unemployment hit 28 percent last year.</p>
<p>Bhutan might be most famous for its Gross National Happiness index. It is a measure of citizens' happiness rather than the country's wealth.</p>
<p>Kipchu trained as a chemical engineer in Bhutan. But he saw a business opportunity soon after arriving in Perth and started an education <strong>consultancy</strong> to help students from Bhutan. Now, his company employs 40 to 50 people in his home country. </p>
<p>"I came to Australia to study but somehow this country gave me an opportunity," said Kipchu. He predicted that the increase of people moving to Australia would continue.</p>
<p>"The job opportunities and the <strong>flexibility</strong> for students to work here makes it more <strong>attractive</strong>."</p>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">01 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Spoken language is made up of sounds. If students want to read, they must be aware of the sound-language connection.</p>
<p><strong>Phonological awareness</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Sound-language Awareness" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-0c17-08db82595aea_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Sound-language Awareness</span></div>
<p>The ability to hear sounds in language and work with them is called phonological awareness. Phonological awareness begins with easy skills and moves to more difficult ones. It is important to note that the development of these skills may <strong>overlap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Phonemic awareness</strong></p>
<p>The smallest part of the spoken language is called a <strong>phoneme</strong>.</p>
<p>A student with phonemic awareness can hear individual sounds and work with them. Phonemic awareness also allows students to understand that the sounds of spoken language work together to make words.</p>
<p>We will talk about phonemic awareness a little later in this article. But for now, know that it is the most advanced type of phonological awareness.</p>
<p><strong>What does phonological awareness look like? </strong></p>
<p><u>Students with early phonological awareness can: </u></p>
<ul>
<li>find and make rhymes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>count words in a sentence</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>count the number of beats (or <strong>syllables</strong>) in a word</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Students with advanced Phonological Awareness can: </u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>blend</strong> small sounds into words</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same first sounds, like <strong>t</strong>oe and <strong>t</strong>ip</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same ending sounds, like su<strong>n</strong> and bi<strong>n </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same middle sounds, like b<strong>a</strong>g and t<strong>a</strong>g</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for phonological awareness</strong></p>
<p>It is important to know the difference between the name of a letter and the sound of a letter. A letter between two slashes // shows its sound. So, the letter "t"<em> </em>between two slashes represents the sound /t/.</p>
<p><u>Students should learn each letter by its sound.</u></p>
<p>At an early stage, say the sound of the letter, not the letter name. This will help students blend words later on. For example, when teaching the letter "n" say /n/ as in "net", not /en/.</p>
<p><u>When teaching letter sounds, do not add vowel sounds.</u></p>
<p>For example, when saying the letter "f," do not say the sound /ef/. Just say /f/. Adding the /e/ vowel sound at the beginning of the letter makes it harder to blend the sounds in a word later. The most common example is the letter "s." Simply say /s/. Do not say /es/. Students later may say /e/school, /e/scared, /e/snake –- which would be incorrect.</p>
<p><u>Teach easier consonants first.</u></p>
<p>Some languages lack some sounds, such as /f/ and /v/. Don't teach those to your students first. Some consonants are easier to say. You can stretch them out, saying them for a longer amount of time. They are m, s, f, l, r, n, v, z.</p>
<p>Some consonants end sharply with a puff of air. They are a little harder to say. They are b, c, d, g, p, t, k, and j. Some consonants are simply difficult to say and are less common. Teach them last. They are h, w, y, x, q.</p>
<p>However, some English sounds do not exist in other languages. If students have trouble with some sounds, teach easier ones first.</p>
<p><u>Teach short vowel sounds first.</u></p>
<p>Long vowel sounds may be easier to say. But short vowel sounds are in many easy words, such as "mat" and "sun." However, short vowel sounds can be very confusing. So, first teach them separately – then altogether.</p>
<p><strong>What does phonemic awareness look like?</strong></p>
<p>As we said earlier, phonemic awareness is the most advanced type of phonological awareness.</p>
<p>Students with phonemic awareness can do the following:</p>
<p><u>Sound <strong>isolation</strong></u></p>
<p>They can hear a single sound in a word and isolate it.</p>
<p>TEACHER: What is the first sound in "bug?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: The first sound in "bug" is /b/.</p>
<p><u>They can identify and group sounds (or phonemes).</u></p>
<p>Students can identify sounds that are the same. These sounds may come at the beginning, the middle, or the end of words. Identifying middle sounds is more advanced than identifying beginning or ending sounds.</p>
<p><u>They can break apart sounds (also called <strong>segmenting</strong> phonemes.)</u></p>
<p>Segmenting is the ability to break a word into smaller sounds.</p>
<p>TEACHER: How many sounds in "flag?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: /f/ /l/ /a/ /g/ -- "Flag" has four sounds!</p>
<p><u>They can blend sounds together (also called blending phonemes).</u></p>
<p>Blending is the ability to say separate sounds together to make a word.</p>
<p>TEACHER: What word is this -- /b/ /a/ /g/?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Bag!</p>
<p>Blending and segmenting are the most important phonemic awareness skills. These are two phonemic awareness skills most linked to fluency. Both segmenting and blending should be practiced regularly.</p>
<p><u>They can lose a sound to make new words (also called deletion.)</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Pin. If I take away the /p/ sound, what do I have left?</p>
<p>STUDENT: In!</p>
<p><u>They can add a sound to make new words (also called addition.)</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Lap. If I add the /f/ sound to the beginning, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Flap!</p>
<p><u>They can change a sound to make new words (also called substitution).</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: If I take away the /s/ in "sat" and add /p/, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Pat!</p>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for phonemic awareness</strong></p>
<p><u>Use words your students know.</u></p>
<p>When doing phonemic awareness activities with your class, use words from a story your students are currently reading. It is helpful to use words the students already know.</p>
<p><u>Focus on sounds not the letters.</u></p>
<p>The focus of phonemic activities should be on the sounds of words and not on the letters or spelling. However, you can teach phonemic awareness while teaching meaning and pronunciation.</p>
<p>Identify sounds that are different or the same in the home language in comparison to English.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for Phonological Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Students with poor phonemic awareness skills cannot do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>isolate single sounds in a word;</li>
<li>break up (or segment) single sounds in a word: paper /pa/-/per/;</li>
<li>blend sounds into words: /s/ /a/ /t/ = sat;</li>
<li>add, delete, or substitute sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some questions for assessing phonological awareness.</p>
<p><u>Count words in a spoken sentence</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: How many words are in this sentence? "You are my friend."</p>
<p>STUDENT: Four!</p>
<p><u>Do They Rhyme?</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Do these words rhyme: "bit," "sit?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: Yes!</p>
<p>TEACHER: Do the words "big" and "bag" rhyme?</p>
<p>STUDENT: No!</p>
<p><u>Syllable</u><u> blending</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: I am going to say a word in parts. Listen: /o/ - /pen/. What word did I say?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Open!</p>
<p><u>Syllable <strong>deletion</strong></u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Say "sat" without the /at/.</p>
<p>STUDENT: /s/</p>
<p><u>Syllable substitution</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: If I take the /s/ away from "sit" and replace it with /p/, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Pit!</p>
<p>Use the tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve your learners. Change them to fit your students and your teaching situation.</p>

            <title>Studies: Meat Sickness from Tick Bites Getting More Common  (2023/8/1)</title>

<span class="byline">By Caty Weaver</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">31 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>More than 100,000 people in the United States have become <strong>allergic</strong> to red meat since 2010 in reaction to tick bites, the government reports.</p>
<p>Medical researchers say they believe many more people have the allergy and do not know it.</p>
<p>The National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two reports on the subject recently.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated photo provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a female Lone Star tick, is found mainly in the Southeast. (James Gathany/CDC via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-54f8-08db91dfaf87_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This undated photo provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a female Lone Star tick, is found mainly in the Southeast. (James Gathany/CDC via AP)</span></div>
<p>Ticks are very small animals that feed on the blood of other animals.</p>
<p>One report estimated that as many as 450,000 Americans have developed the meat allergy. That would make it the 10th most common food allergy in the U.S., said Dr. Scott Commins. The University of North Carolina researcher co-wrote both reports.</p>
<p>Health officials said they do not know of any confirmed deaths. However, people with the allergy have described it as strange and terrifying.</p>
<p>"I never connected it with any food because it was hours after eating," said one patient, Bernadine Heller-Greenman.</p>
<p>The reaction, called alpha-gal syndrome, happens when an infected person eats beef, pork, or other meat of mammals. Taking in other mammal products, such as milk, also causes the reaction.</p>
<p>A sugar called alpha-gal exists in mammal meat and in the <strong>saliva</strong> of ticks. When the sugar enters the body through the skin, the body's own defense, or immune, system reacts too strongly.</p>
<p>Scientists saw such reactions in patients taking a cancer drug that was made in mouse cells containing the alpha-gal sugar. But in 2011 researchers first reported that it could spread through tick bites, too.</p>
<p>They tied it to the lone star tick. Scientists say the ticks live mainly in the eastern and southern U.S.</p>
<p>One of the studies released recently examined test results from the main U.S. private laboratory looking for alpha-gal antibodies. Those tests showed the number of people who had the antibodies rose from about 13,000 in 2017 to 19,000 in 2022.</p>
<p>Experts say cases may have increased for several reasons. They say the lone star tick population is expanding. They also suggest more doctors might be learning about the disease and ordering tests for it.</p>
<p>But many doctors are not.</p>
<p>The second study was based on a <strong>survey</strong> last year of 1,500 U.S. general care doctors and health professionals. It found nearly half of them had never heard of alpha-gal syndrome, and only five percent said they felt very sure they could identify it. Researchers used that information to estimate the number of people with the allergy — 450,000.</p>
<p>People with this condition can experience <strong>symptoms</strong> including <strong>hives</strong>, <strong>nausea</strong>, <strong>vomiting</strong>, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the lips, throat, tongue or eyes. Unlike some other food allergies, which happen soon after eating, these reactions hit hours later.</p>
<p>Some patients have only stomach symptoms. The American Gastroenterological Association says people with unexplained diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain should be tested for the syndrome.</p>
<p>Doctors advise people with the allergy to stop eating meat and other foods that cause the reaction and to have <strong>epinephrine </strong>available to them at all times. And, doctors say, avoid tick bites.</p>
<p>The allergy can go away in some people. Commins said he has seen that happen in about 15 to 20 percent of his patients. Staying free of tick bites is extremely important.</p>
<p>"The tick bites are central to this. They <strong>perpetuate</strong> the allergy," he said.</p>
<p>One of his patients is Heller-Greenman, a 78-year-old art historian in New York. She spends summers on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. She said she is used to getting bitten by ticks on the island. She has had Lyme disease, also caused by tick bites, four times.</p>
<p>About five years ago, Heller-Greenman started experiencing terrible, itchy hives on her back, middle and legs in the middle of the night. Her doctors decided it was an allergic reaction but could not identify the cause.</p>
<p>She never ate a lot of meat, but one day in January 2020 she had two beef meals in a row. Six hours after eating the second, she woke up nauseated, then vomited, had diarrhea and a lack of balance, or dizziness. She <strong>passed out</strong> three times.</p>
<p>Doctors identified alpha-gal syndrome as the cause soon after the incident. Heller-Greenman was told to avoid ticks and to stop eating red meat and milk products. There have been no allergic reactions since.</p>
<p>"I have one grandchild that watches me like a hawk," she said, making sure she reads food <strong>labels</strong> and avoids foods that could cause a reaction.</p>
<p>"I feel very lucky, really, that this has worked out for me," she said. "Not all doctors are knowledgeable about this."</p>

            <title>Catch Garden Pests, Diseases Early to Save Plants  (2023/8/1)</title>

<p>In her latest gardening story, Jessica Damiano tells of the <strong>garden</strong> <strong>pests</strong> and diseases she has seen in her plants.</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press </em>writer suggests acting quickly when combatting garden pests and diseases. When not dealt with quickly, pests and diseases can quickly grow and reproduce. That can result in less plant growth and worse health, less flower and fruit production, or even death of your plants.</p>
<p>Her measure always begins with the gentlest treatment possible. She only intensifies her treatments when necessary. Even then, she has her limits. Damiano says she would rather lose a flower or vegetable plant than use strong chemicals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This July 5, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a scarlet lily beetle on an Asiatic lily stem on Long Island, N.Y.(Jessica Damiano via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1132a559-a88a-4262-907b-3501ce93cbdf_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This July 5, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a scarlet lily beetle on an Asiatic lily stem on Long Island, N.Y.(Jessica Damiano via AP)</span></div>
<p>In the case of her tomato plants, Damiano caught the aphids, a pest, early. She washed them off and removed the ones that would not come off by using her fingers under moving water. They have not returned in the week since removing them, but she looks out for them every day, just in case.</p>
<p>Had the invasion been severe or the water and finger removal method been ineffective, she would have used Neem oil. The organic oil, which comes from the seeds of the Neem tree, kills aphids by not permitting them to breathe. It is safe to use on plants that will be eaten and it is not harmful to people, animals, and birds. Still, it should be used after the sun has set when helpful insects are less active.</p>
<p>The same day Damiano found the aphids, she found another pest called scarlet lily beetles on her Asiatic lily plants. The adult red insects feed on a grouping of plants called true lilies and fritillaries.</p>
<p>In an earlier <strong>stage</strong> of life, called the larval stage, they cover themselves in waste. This makes them less appealing to those that would want to eat them. But the coating also protects them from chemicals, making them difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The pests had already damaged some of her plants. To prevent more damage, she removed them by <strong>tapping</strong> them off of the plant into some water with soap and vinegar, or household cleaners.</p>
<p>Her rhododendron, a flowering plant, were attacked by a pest called azalea bark scale last summer. She saw the white insects had come back this year. Some of the leaves were <strong>infested</strong>, so she cut them off. But because most of the leaves only had a few of the pests, she was able to remove them by touching each insect with some rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>By working early, Damiano slowed or stopped infestations that could have killed her plants. The same would be true for diseases, many of which also respond better to early treatments.</p>

<p>A Pakistani mountaineering official says a Norwegian woman and her Nepali Sherpa guide have completed the fastest climb of the world's 14 highest mountains.</p>
<p>Kristin Harila, age 37, and her guide Tenjen Sherpa, age 35, reached the top of the final mountain, K2, last Thursday.</p>
<p>All the <strong>peaks</strong> the two reached are above 8,000 meters, said Karrar Haidri, the secretary at the Pakistan Alpine Club.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Norwegian climber Kristin Harila, 37, right, and her guide Tenjen Sherpa pose for a photograph in Kathmandu, Nepal, Tuesday, June 6, 2023.

(AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)</span></div>
<p>"A big congratulations to Kristin Harila and Tenjen Sherpa on this remarkable achievement," said Haidri, adding, "They did it in 92 days."</p>
<p>The former record-holder, Nirmal Purja, a Nepali-born British citizen, climbed the 14 peaks in 189 days in 2019.</p>
<p>Most mountain climbers spend years trying to climb the world's greatest peaks.</p>
<p>Both climbers topped Shishapangma in the Tibet area of China on April 26. They have since climbed Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Annapurna in Nepal before going to Pakistan, where they climbed Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II and the Broad Peak before topping K2.</p>
<p>The company Seven <strong>Summit</strong> Treks (SST) provided support for the climbers' efforts.</p>
<p>Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering company is also on K2 leading a different group. He said the climbers used a window of good weather to go to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>"They have made a summit a short while ago," Madison told Reuters, adding that the Norwegian woman was "extremely <strong>tough</strong> mentally and physically."</p>
<p>Harila first attempted to break the record and climb all 14 top peaks in 2022. However, China restricted foreign climbers during the coronavirus pandemic so Harila was unable to attempt two of the 14 peaks.</p>
<p>K2 has one of the deadliest records for mountaineers, with most deaths happening on the return down. Any wrong move can cause an avalanche, or snowslide, and kill. Only a few hundred climbers have successfully reached its summit.</p>
<p>And one more climber made that list and set another record on Thursday, reported SST director Tashi Lakpa Sherpa. Seventeen-year-old Nima Rinjin Sherpa became the youngest person to climb K2, Tashi said.</p>

            <title>UN Aims to Remove Oil from Tanker in Red Sea  (2023/8/1) | 联合国欲转移红海油轮上的石油</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>An international team is working to remove oil from a ship anchored in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen.<br/>
一个国际小组正在努力转移停泊在红海也门海岸一艘油轮上的石油。</p>
<p>The oil tanker, called the SOF Safer, has not been used for at least eight years. It contains over 1 million barrels of oil.<br/>
这艘萨菲尔号油轮已经至少8年没有使用了。它装载了100多万桶石油。</p>
<p>Experts say the ship is at risk of breaking up or exploding.<br/>
专家说，这艘船有发生破裂或爆炸的危险。</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported in 2020 that seawater entered the ship's engine room and caused damage. The water also put the ship in danger of sinking.<br/>
美联社2020年报道称，海水进入该船的机舱并造成损坏。这些积水也使这艘船面临沉没的危险。</p>
<p>For years, the United Nations and governments of nearby countries warned that an explosion or oil leak could disrupt shipping in the Middle East. The ship is close to the Yemeni ports of Hodeida and Ras Issa. Many ships travel from the Persian Gulf, past Yemen and through Egypt's Suez Canal to get to the Mediterranean Sea.<br/>
多年来，联合国和周边国家政府一直警告说，爆炸或石油泄漏可能会扰乱中东的航运。该船靠近也门荷台达港和拉斯伊萨港。许多船只从波斯湾出发，经过也门，通过埃及苏伊士运河到达地中海。</p>
<p>The United Nations purchased another oil tanker so crews could move the oil from the Safer.<br/>
联合国购买了另一艘油轮，以便船员能够从萨菲尔号上转移石油。</p>
<p>Antonio Guterres is the UN Secretary General. In a statement, he said the work is a "critical next step in avoiding an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe."<br/>
安东尼奥·古特雷斯是联合国秘书长。他在一份声明中表示，这项工作是“避免环境和人道主义灾难的关键一步”。</p>
<p>The U.N. said the job will be done in less than three weeks.<br/>
联合国表示，这项工作将在三周内完成。</p>
<p>The Safer was built in the 1970s and sold to the Yemeni government in the 1980s so it could move oil pumped from the fields in Marib.<br/>
萨菲尔号建造于20世纪70年代，并于20世纪80年代出售给也门政府，以便运送从马里卜油田开采的石油。</p>
<p>The U.N. said a leak could have been worse than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, one of the largest ecological disasters.<br/>
联合国表示，若发生泄漏，可能比1989年埃克森瓦尔迪兹号油轮泄漏更严重，这次事故是最大的生态灾难之一。</p>
<p>When the oil is removed, the work will not be over, however. The Safer will be anchored to an underwater oil pipeline before it is taken away to a scrapyard.<br/>
但是当石油被转移后，工作不会结束。萨菲尔号在被送往废料场之前，将被锚定在水下输油管道上。</p>
<p>David Gressly is the U.N. humanitarian official for Yemen. He said moving the oil will prevent a "worst-case scenario." Guterres said, cleaning up an oil spill in Yemen could have cost "tens of billions of dollars."<br/>
大卫·格雷斯利是联合国也门人道主义事务官员。他说，转移石油能防止“最坏的情况”。古特雷斯说，若也门发生石油泄漏进行清理，可能需要“数百亿美元”。</p>

<p>Researchers say they have identified earth movement signals that could predict earthquakes up to two hours before they hit.</p>
<p>The signals were recorded, or detected, by <strong>GPS</strong> collection devices. The devices were positioned in areas where major earthquakes had struck in the past.</p>
<p>Scientists noted, however, that the right equipment does not currently exist to use the data to predict earthquakes. But if the sensitivity of current GPS measuring devices can be improved, the researchers say a new earthquake warning system could be possible.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are caused by movements, or slips, in existing faults under Earth's surface, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquake-facts-earthquake-fantasy#:~:text=An%20earthquake%20is%20the%20ground,we%20feel%20during%20an%20earthquake.">explains</a>. A fault is a long break in rock attached to Earth's crust. When tension builds up along a fault, energy waves are released and travel through the crust. This causes the ground to shake.</p>
<p>Technology for predicting earthquakes currently remains very limited. But the USGS does have equipment that can pick up seismic data when an earthquake is just starting. The term seismic relates to earthquake activity.</p>
<p>The USGS method makes it possible to warn people in areas where seismic activity is expected. But this method generally can only provide a warning several seconds before an earthquake hits. The USGS system is called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.shakealert.org/">ShakeAlert</a>. It has already been deployed along the U.S. West Coast. That is where the majority of earthquakes happen in the country.</p>
<p>But the new detection method could produce warnings up to two hours before the damaging effects of an earthquake are felt. Such a system could save lives by giving people the chance to get out of buildings that might collapse in an earthquake.</p>
<p>Two scientists from France's National Research Institute for Sustainable Development carried out a study that described the latest results. The findings recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg2565">appeared</a> in the publication <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers examined GPS data collected before and after past earthquake events around the world. The data was collected on 90 earthquakes measuring larger than 7 on the Richter scale. The study period covered the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The team identified a <strong>pattern</strong> of fault movements as they examined the data collected from different areas. The movement signals were recorded within two hours of an earthquake striking. The researchers said the study demonstrates that faults generally begin to move about two hours before a large earthquake.</p>
<p>Scientists had identified such signals before single earthquakes in the past. But until now, researchers were not able to link those signals to all seismic events.</p>
<p>While the data identified this pattern, the scientists said the instruments that could capture GPS data in real time do not currently exist.</p>
<p>The National Research Institute for Sustainable Development issued a statement on the development. It said that in order to make predictions, researchers "would need to measure signals at least 10 times smaller than what we can presently do."</p>
<p>Another way to possibly build a better earthquake prediction system would be to develop "dense measurement networks" that sit very close to faults. However, such an effort would require major technological progress, the institute said.</p>
<p>Quentin Bletery is a geophysicist at C<i></i>244;te d'Azur University in the city of Nice. Bletery worked together on the study with Jean-Mathieu Nocquet, another researcher at the university.</p>
<p>Bletery <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/warning-signs-detected-hours-ahead-big-earthquakes">told</a> <em>Science</em> that the study found that no observable movement was identified in the first 46 hours leading up to an earthquake. But starting around two hours before an earthquake, the GPS signals recording movement started to increase.</p>
<p>To confirm its findings, the team compared that data to more than 100,000 <strong>random</strong> time periods recorded when no earthquakes were reported. That experiment found that similar patterns in non-earthquake areas happened just 0.03 percent of the time.</p>
<p>"This tells us earthquakes are predictable in nature," Bletery told <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>The scientists note that more research is needed to support their findings. Much of the information used in the latest study, for example, depended heavily on data from GPS stations near major earthquake sites.</p>

<p>More restaurants in Japan are offering bugs in their dishes.</p>
<p>On a recent vacation in Tokyo, Takumi Yamamoto ate a special lunch of cricket curry and silkworm sashimi, which is usually made with raw fish. He drank a water bug <strong>cider</strong>.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old office worker is one of many people around the world with a growing interest in entomophagy, or the practice of eating insects. Bugs are slowly becoming more usable as a food source.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Shunnosuke Suga eats beetle larvae, as he eats Almond tofu with beetle larvae at Take-Noko cafe in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2023. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-c3c8-08db8ece982a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Shunnosuke Suga eats beetle larvae, as he eats Almond tofu with beetle larvae at Take-Noko cafe in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2023. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)</span></div>
<p>Yamamoto said he sometimes ate grasshoppers dipped in soy sauce as a child. In Tokyo, he ate insect foods at Take-Noko cafe, which serves many bug dishes.</p>
<p>"It's fun to select from a wider variety of dishes," Yamamoto said. "Everything was tasty. In particular, the water bug <strong>cider</strong> was quite refreshing ... like a green apple."</p>
<p>Entomophagy started to be taken seriously after the United Nations declared bugs a good source of protein to feed a growing world population. With livestock farming's effects on climate change and world hunger issues from weather and war, there has been more interest in the nutrition bugs can provide.</p>
<p>Some people think eating insects is just <strong>gross</strong>. But Japan has a rich history of using insects as food.</p>
<p>Grasshoppers, silkworms and wasps were traditionally eaten in areas of the country with little meat and fish. It was a <strong>practice</strong> that grew in popularity because of food shortages during and after World War II, said Take-Noko <strong>manager</strong> Michiko Miura.</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been advances in <strong>rearing</strong> things like crickets and mealworms for food, so the possibility of using insects as ingredients is really growing," she added. Several companies in Japan sell cakes and <strong>snacks</strong> made from cricket flour.</p>
<p>Interest has also grown at Take-Noko, which is often fully <strong>reserved</strong> on weekends.</p>
<p>The restaurant's curry contains crickets in meatball form. The "sashimi" is the left-over shell of silkworms, and the cider contains water bug <strong>extract</strong> and is topped with a whole insect.</p>
<p>Takeo Saito started the restaurant. He also has a <strong>packaged</strong> food company that offers more than 60 kinds of bug foods, from scorpions to tarantulas.</p>
<p>"Our aim is not for insects to be something separate, but to be enjoyed at the same table as vegetables, fish, and meat," Saito said.</p>

            <title>In Dubai, ‘Gourmet Water’ Injected with Minerals  (2023/7/31)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">30 July 2023</span><br/>
<p><span style="color:black">New kinds of drinks like smoothies, lattes, beers, and cocktails have become popular in recent years. Now a place in Dubai is serving what it claims to be "<strong>gourmet</strong> water."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Thirty different kinds of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">The Aqua Water Bar by Luqel gets its water the traditional way – from the pipe that runs water to your house. The government of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates says water from the pipe, called tap water, is safe to drink and meets international standards. But people in the Middle Eastern city still prefer bottled water.</span></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Roia Jabari, managing director of AQUA Water Bar by LUQEL poses at her store in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7c789374-f0f3-4e22-b76b-a4f4a7a82a82_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Roia Jabari, managing director of AQUA Water Bar by LUQEL poses at her store in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)</span></div>
<p><span style="color:black">The water at Aqua Water Bar is said to be different. The <strong>bar</strong> says it injects a very small amount of minerals, called micro-dosing, into the water. The system is designed by the German water filtration company Luqel. And its water is compared to costly water like Alpine or Arctic-sourced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Roia Jabari is a director at Aqua Water. She said experts have designed its water to fit your "needs and <strong>mood</strong>." And she added, "We can give you the perfectly mineralized <strong>recipe</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">One drink, "Runners Heaven," is high in sodium and potassium to help runners after being in the desert heat. Another, "Vegan's Choice," offers minerals that could be lacking when not eating meat. Buyers can fill up their bottles with any of the mineral combinations for around 50 cents per 500 milliliters or pay more for a nonalcoholic mixed drink. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">It is not an entirely new idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">A water bar serving what it said was heavily <strong>filtered</strong> New York City tap water opened in the city's East Village area in 2012. It received heavy criticism. Another briefly opened in Washington, DC in 2019. It also did not get the best <strong>reviews</strong>. Neither appears to have stayed open for very long. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">But Dubai, a modern city built on desert sands, could be such a place for the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Alcohol is available in bars in the UAE, but the Muslim country's population does not drink alcohol. As a center of international business, it brings in wealthy, health-centered people who support the wellness industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Although Aqua Water is often visited by businessmen who work in the surrounding Dubai Media City, Jabari says that the bar is not just for wealthy buyers. She says the water, which sells for 54 cents per 500 milliliters, is not too costly. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">To help the environment, buyers can either fill their own bottles or buy a reusable one starting at around $2.50. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Early reviews appear to be good, with the bar having 4.6 stars on Google reviews based on around 12 reviews. "(The water) was actually different," said Bilal Rizvi, who stopped in to try it out recently. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Jabari was born in San Diego, California, and is a designer who has lived in the UAE for 24 years. She designed the bar around ideas based on water. Additionally, the bar also serves Persian food as a way to honor her ancestry. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Jabari hopes to expand the business. She sees room for growth in neighboring countries. She said, "Saudi Arabia is a huge market for us. I believe that Abu Dhabi is our next step."</span></p>

            <title>Churches in Europe See Record Numbers of Visitors  (2023/7/31)</title>

<p>Famous Christian religious places in southern Europe are seeing record numbers of visitors. But not everyone is happy about the large crowds. Church leaders are finding it difficult to balance the needs of <strong>tourists</strong> and the people who come to pray.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with more visitors</strong></p>
<p>This spring, the Vatican opened a separate "pathway" starting outside St. Peter's Basilica for those who want to take part in religious services. St. Peter's spokesperson Roberta Leone said officials made the change because of long lines for the 55,000 daily visitors.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Tourist line up to enter at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona on July 18, 2023. (Photo by Pau BARRENA / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2b4eea31-f993-40c1-ad81-5c822d176e34_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Tourist line up to enter at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona on July 18, 2023.

<p>The Vatican's move is an example of what many churches are doing. They have tourists and religious people go separate ways. Religious services are sometimes held in different places. And sometimes tourists are not permitted at worship times.</p>
<p>With an estimated 330 million people visiting religious places yearly around the world, religious tourism is one of the largest parts of the tourism market.</p>
<p>Worshippers often come because celebrated churches generally have more services than regular churches. They need to be able to enter at no cost. Tourists often pay fees that are important for churches to maintain their buildings.</p>
<p>Daniel Olsen of Brigham Young University in Utah studies religious tourism. Olsen said of the situation, "It's just really hard because you also want people to experience your faith."</p>
<p><strong>Different opinions</strong></p>
<p>Some religious people are unhappy with the large numbers of visitors.</p>
<p>After the ceremony of <strong>Mass</strong> in the burial area of the Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, Spain, Joan Albaiges said, "The <strong>temple</strong> needs to be a place for services and not a <strong>theme park</strong>."</p>
<p>He praised the policy change in recent years to celebrate one Sunday Mass at the main<strong> altar</strong>.</p>
<p>But there is such demand for the 800 free tickets that several hundred people waiting often do not get in, said Josep Maria Turull. Turull is the <strong>rector</strong> at Sagrada Familia who also oversees tourism for the local church organization.</p>
<p>Religious leaders say the histories of the sacred buildings should be presented to visitors. These visitors increasingly do not know about faith traditions in churches.</p>
<p>José Fernández Lago is rector of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Filled with beautiful art, Santiago's<strong> cathedral </strong>draws hundreds of thousands of tourists and religious visitors known as pilgrims.</p>
<p>To remain a special place for religious pilgrims, Lago said, the cathedral does not charge money for entry. The cathedral also does not limit visitor numbers or require people to wear <strong>formal</strong> clothing.</p>
<p>But visits are not permitted during the four daily Masses celebrated at the main altar. And priests as well as security guards always have to ask visitors to lower their voices so that worshipers can pray in peace.</p>
<p>"Some people go to the cathedral, and they don't realize they're in a church," Lago observed. He added, "It's a situation that's developing in nations that were majority Christian, and now faith is cooling off."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The American space agency NASA has offered its satellite technology to Brazil to help identify destruction in the Amazon rainforest.<br/>
美国宇航局向巴西提供卫星技术帮助确定亚马逊雨林的破坏情况。</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson made the offer during a recent trip to Brazil. The NASA chief visited the country's space agency – the National Institute for Space Research – in the southeastern city of Jose dos Campos. Nelson's trip to South America also included visits to Argentina and Colombia.<br/>
美国宇航局局长比尔·纳尔逊在最近的巴西之行中提出了这一提议。纳尔逊访问了位于该国东南部城市何塞·多斯坎波斯的巴西国家太空研究院。纳尔逊的南美之行还包括对阿根廷和哥伦比亚的访问。</p>
<p>Brazilian Science Minister Luciana Santos showed Nelson around the institute and explained some of the space agency's programs.<br/>
巴西科技部长卢西亚娜·桑托斯陪同纳尔逊参观了该研究院，并解释了该航天机构的一些项目。</p>
<p>During a news conference, Nelson described one new NASA satellite that he said would be completed by January. He said the satellite, called NISAR, will even be able to capture images of what is happening in real time below the forest cover.<br/>
纳尔逊在新闻发布会上谈到了美国宇航局的一颗新卫星，他说这颗卫星将于明年1月完工。他说，这颗名为NISAR的卫星甚至能够捕获森林覆盖下的实时图像。</p>
<p>"It is going to be able to look through the canopy of the jungle so that we can see if someone has burned the undergrowth and that would ultimately kill the big trees," Nelson said.<br/>
纳尔逊说：“它将能够穿透丛林的树冠观察，这样我们就可以看到是否有人烧毁了灌木丛，这样做最终会毁灭大树。”</p>
<p>NASA says the new satellite will support a project called SERVIR Amazonia. It helps provide Earth science data to scientists and decision-makers across the Amazon area to record environmental changes in near real-time. The project helps predict climate threats like deforestation and food insecurity. It can also provide data to emergency workers during natural disasters.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，这颗新卫星将支持一个名为SERVIR Amazonia的项目。它有助于向亚马逊地区的科学家和决策者提供地球科学数据，以近乎实时地记录环境变化。该项目有助于预测气候威胁，如森林砍伐和粮食不安全。它还可以在自然灾害期间为应急人员提供数据。</p>
<p>Brazil's space agency has launched a series of satellites in partnership with China since 1999. Those satellites aim to gather data on agricultural operations and the environment.<br/>
自1999年以来，巴西航天机构与中国合作发射了一系列卫星。这些卫星旨在收集有关农业经营和环境的数据。</p>
<p>Brazil depends on satellite imagery to watch over the Amazon. But cloud cover often makes it difficult for satellites to capture clear and timely images. The NASA chief said the satellites NASA plans to place into orbit early next year will add an "extreme ability to understand what is happening" to the rainforest.<br/>
巴西依靠卫星图像来监视亚马逊。但云层覆盖往往使卫星难以捕捉到清晰及时的图像。纳尔逊表示，美国宇航局计划明年初将这颗卫星送入轨道，它将为雨林增加一种“了解正在发生的事情的极限能力”。</p>
<p>Nelson, a former U.S. senator who once flew to space, also met with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia. After the meeting, he told reporters he thanked the president "for his continuous effort to save the Amazon rainforest."<br/>
作为一位曾飞往太空的前美国参议员，纳尔逊还在巴西利亚会见了巴西总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦。会后他告诉记者，他感谢巴西总统“为拯救亚马逊雨林所做的持续努力”。</p>
<p>Nelson said that when he flew aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Columbia in 1986, he witnessed the destruction of the rainforest by the different colors he could see from his spacecraft window.<br/>
纳尔逊说，当他在1986年乘坐美国宇航局的哥伦比亚号航天飞机时，他从飞船窗户看到了不同颜色，亲眼见证了人类对雨林的破坏。</p>

<p>The high court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit such decisions based on race.</p>
<p>The policy that many colleges used to increase the percentage of minorities they admitted was called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-supreme-court-rejects-race-consideration-in-college-admissions/7160538.html">affirmative action</a>. They said the policy helped make their groups of students more <strong>diverse</strong> and improved the ability of minority groups to get higher education.</p>

<p>Those opposed to affirmative action said the policy prevented some qualified students from getting into <strong>selective</strong> universities.</p>
<p>Colleges in much of the U.S. were permitted to partly consider a student's race in their admissions decisions for over 50 years.</p>
<p>As a result of the high court's decision in June, most colleges and most universities must now consider <strong>factors</strong> other than race.</p>
<p><strong>Quotas in Brazil</strong></p>
<p>In Brazil, a version of affirmative action has been a part of admissions since 2012. The country has a law that permits both racial and economic <strong>quotas</strong> for its federal or public universities.</p>
<p>Three <a class="wsw__a" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12564">researchers</a> wrote about the effects of affirmative action in Brazil for the <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em>. They <strong>condensed</strong> their findings in a piece for <em>The Conversation, </em>an online publication.</p>
<p>Neil Lewis Jr. of Cornell University in New York state, Inacio Bo of the University of Macau and Rodrigo Zeidan of New York University's Shanghai <strong>campus</strong> worked on the article.</p>
<p>They explained the background of affirmative action in Brazil and the kinds of students the policy affects. They say the policy "has proved to be quite beneficial."</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about quotas</strong></p>
<p>The quotas became law in August 2012. At the time, many people worried that Brazilian students, who were already attending college, would suffer. They argued that professors would have to lower the level of their teaching in order to connect with a larger number of Black and indigenous students from poor areas. They said wealthy students with a good early education would leave for private universities. In some cases, the writers noted, wealthy students did go to other universities.</p>
<p>Others said Black high school students in Brazil would not work as hard because they knew the universities were holding places for them. A study showed that this was true for students who were already achieving. However, the writers said students in a lower group worked harder because they knew they could continue with their studies. Overall, they said, the quotas permitted a larger group of minority students to continue their education.</p>
<p>Only one of Brazil's 81 senators voted against the law. In a story published in 2012, the <em>New York Times</em> quoted Brazil's current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as saying the policy would help some racial groups "make up for lost time." Lula had been president from 2003 to 2010.</p>
<p>The researchers talked about what they considered the difference between Brazil's quota system and the affirmative action policy in the United States.</p>
<p>In Brazil, at least half of the places at federal universities are held for students who are either poor or from racial minority groups. In the U.S., quotas have been unlawful for more than 40 years. But universities could use data about race and wealth to decide the best combination of students.</p>
<p>In Brazil, most students, including those from wealthy families, hope to go to federal universities. The schools are both high-quality and cost-free. One concern about the federal universities, however, is that openings are limited. Some people will not get in and will have to find other schools for higher education.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits in Brazil</strong></p>
<p>The writers said, for those who do attend the federal universities, the last 10 years of quotas have had good results.</p>
<p>The researchers said students admitted because of the quotas performed well. If they lacked learning compared to wealthier students, they learned the necessary skills by graduation.</p>
<p>In addition, some quota students got better grades than the traditional students. The researchers said not all students from wealthy parts of Brazil with good high schools were guaranteed to do well in their university studies.</p>
<p>When the affirmative action plan came out in Brazil, da Silva said it was hard to find Black doctors, dentists and bank supervisors. But Lewis, Zeidan and Bo said the students admitted because of affirmative action were seven percent more likely to have those jobs because of the policy. Many students, they said, would not have moved on to higher education if they did not have places set aside at the universities.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>The writers said the quota system helped diversify students in federal universities. Before 2012, it was difficult for Brazilian universities to make sure poor and minority students could receive higher education. Some universities developed policies to bring in more students from poor areas. However, that did not always make a clear difference in the race of students attending the college.</p>
<p>The writers of the piece worried that a similar plan by American colleges and universities would not work as well as affirmative action. They advised university leaders that race-based polices work better than other systems.</p>
<p>"University leaders," they wrote, "must find...new ways to make their campuses more diverse. How to achieve that may be a <strong>challenge</strong>, but it seems to remain a worthwhile <strong>pursuit</strong>."</p>
<p>In their article, the writers said other nations should be able to enact policies similar to the ones in Brazil without worrying that students will be deeply hurt. The one group they said they are concerned about is the group of wealthier students who lost their places at the federal universities because of quotas. Those students face the high cost of attending private universities.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program, we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples, notes on usage, and sometimes we even use them in short stories.</p>
<p>Today's idiom does not sound nice. In fact, it sounds quite <strong>cruel.</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - National Treasure, right, with jockey John Velazquez, beats Blazing Sevens, with jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., wins the 148th Preakness Stakes horse race at Pimlico Race Course, May 20, 2023, in Maryland.

<p>Today, we talk about <u>beating a dead horse</u>.</p>
<p>Why would anyone do something as pointless as beating a dead animal? Well, that is how we use the expression: to describe something that is a useless thing to do. You are just wasting your time. It is not productive. There is no point.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster's online dictionary says this expression comes from the mid-19th century. Back then, some people may have beaten horses to make them go faster. At the time, this was often thought of as an acceptable practice.</p>
<p>But <u>beating a dead horse</u> would be pointless – because it's dead. No amount of beating will change that fact. We often use this expression in the <strong>negative</strong>. We say things like "I don't want to beat horse ..." or "Not to beat a dead horse..."</p>
<p>Now, if you are a horse lover and don't want to talk about beating one, please do not worry. We have many other expressions and idioms that have a similar meaning.</p>
<p><em>Let's say your friend talks about the same problem. They do not take your advice and they do not seem to want to accept any solution. If you don't want to say to them, "Now you're just beating a dead horse," you can say, "Look, we've <u>gone over the same ground</u> and nothing has changed. So, can we please change the topic?"</em></p>
<p>When you go over the same ground, you talk about the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>There is another expression with the word "ground" that means the same thing as "beat a dead horse." If I have a problem and talk about it too much, I have <u>run it into the ground</u>. Running something into the ground means you have talked about to death. You have talked about it <strong><u>ad nauseam</u></strong>. This means you are making other people sick over it.</p>
<p>So, it is not a good idea <u>to <strong>dwell</strong> <strong>on</strong> an old topic</u>. Hearing about the same thing over and over again is tiring. Many people have lost good friends from <strong><u>belaboring</u></strong><u> a point or an issue.</u></p>
<p>And that is all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>But join us again! We explore so many expressions and idioms in this program. In fact, each week we teach new ones. Not to beat a dead horse, but we really are a great resource for learning English.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Canada Releases Plan to End Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies  (2023/7/30)</title>

<p>Canada on Monday presented its plan for ending many of its fossil fuel industry <strong>subsidies</strong>. The plan's release makes Canada the first member-country of the Group of 20 to honor a 2009 promise to end government financial support to the industry.</p>
<p>Climate policy experts say the announcement marks an important step forward. But some argue that the plan falls short by continuing to permit government support for some oil and gas projects. The proposed measure includes exceptions that would permit subsidies for projects that plan to reduce <strong>emissions</strong> through technology like carbon capture and storage, or CCS.</p>
<p>Canada said it will not cancel any current multi-year subsidy agreements that are already in place.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - ExxonMobil renewable diesel complex at the Strathcona refinery near Edmonton, Canada. (Photo: Business Wire)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-7264-08db8f7a5e62_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Steven Guilbeault is Canada's Environment Minister. He said the plan guarantees that "federal support for oil and gas goes to projects that decarbonize" their production and show substantial reductions in <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> emissions.</p>
<p>Active fossil fuel operations are <strong>exempt</strong> from the policy if they fall into one of six <strong>categories</strong>. One category is the ability to reduce carbon emissions. Another is support for clean energy. Businesses that provide critical energy to rural communities are another exempted category, as are those that support native communities in fossil fuel activities or those that have a plan to reach <strong>net-zero</strong> emissions by 2030.</p>
<p>Bringing an end to fossil fuel subsidies is part of a 2022 deal signed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority Liberal party and the New Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<p>The NDP critic for Climate Change and Environment, Laurel Collins, said the new rules do not go far enough.</p>
<p>Collins said, "it is clear that this announcement doesn't meet the urgency of the moment when climate disasters are putting everything we value at risk."</p>
<p>Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer. Carbon capture is expected to play a major part in decarbonizing the industry. Canada last year announced a CCS investment tax credit. Carbon capture is a process by which carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere and stored underground.</p>
<p>The Pathways Alliance is a partnership between Canada's six largest oil sands producers. It is planning to develop a $12 billion CCS center in northern Alberta. Pathways President Kendall Dilling said in a statement that the organization was happy the framework recognized the need for government partnership on the project.</p>
<p>Canada is expected to release a plan to end public financing of fossil fuel projects within the next year.</p>
<p>Julia Levin is with the climate group Environmental Defense. "The Government of Canada must quickly take the final step and end all fossil financing – without any <strong>loopholes</strong> for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen or CCS," she said.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Grover Cleveland. When Americans remember him, it is mostly because he makes writing presidential timelines difficult. Cleveland was the nation's 22nd president, and also its 24th.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Grover Cleveland" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2d7b1b83-5c2c-4f17-ba9b-34af26f5f124_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Grover Cleveland</span></div>
<p>He remains the only U.S. president to date whose second term did not immediately follow the first.</p>
<p>Cleveland is also notable because of his personal life, and because he held office during one of the country's worst economic crises.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Stephen Grover Cleveland was born in the northeastern state of New Jersey and grew up mostly in New York. He was a middle child in a family of nine children. His father was a minister, and the family did not have much money.</p>
<p>As a result, Cleveland had little formal education. He was one of the few presidents who did not go to college. But he was able to become a lawyer. He earned enough money and developed a good professional image.</p>
<p>In time, he became a sheriff, a mayor, and the governor of the state of New York.</p>
<p>In his early life, Cleveland did not marry and have children. Instead, he had many friends, with whom he enjoyed hunting, fishing, and eating and drinking in restaurants.</p>
<p>But Cleveland did have a relationship with a <strong>widow</strong> named Maria Halpin. She became pregnant and said Cleveland was the baby's father.</p>
<p>Cleveland said he was not sure if he was. However, he gave the child some financial support, the name of one of his closest friends, and his own family name. The child was called Oscar Folsom Cleveland.</p>
<p>Shortly after the boy was born, his mother was sent to an institution for the mentally unstable. Doctors quickly confirmed that her mental health was fine, but her son was taken from her and raised by another family.</p>
<p>The story about Halpin and the child became an issue in the election of 1884. The Democratic Party had nominated Cleveland as their candidate for president.</p>
<p>In general, voters liked his message of limiting federal spending, reducing the power of wealthy interests, and stopping political corruption. Some called him "Grover the Good."</p>
<p>But Cleveland's opponents said his history with Maria Halpin showed that he was an <strong>immoral</strong> man. At anti-Cleveland rallies, Republicans chanted, "Ma, ma, where's my Pa?" Pa is another word for father.</p>
<p>But Cleveland did not comment much on the matter. His defenders said Cleveland's honesty as a public official was more important than his bad judgment as a private citizen.</p>
<p>Voters seemed to agree. Cleveland narrowly won the election. His supporters answered the Republicans' chants of "where's my Pa?" by saying, "Gone to the White House, ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p><strong>First presidential term</strong></p>
<p>Grover Cleveland's presidency was unusual because he did not want to use the office to propose laws. Instead, he mostly aimed to keep the federal government operating efficiently. He also wanted to limit lawmakers' power to help special interest groups.</p>
<p>As a result, Cleveland vetoed many bills in his first term. He set a record at that time for saying no to proposals from Congress.</p>
<p>One of the few ideas that he supported was reducing<strong> tariffs</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of his fellow Democrats liked that idea, too. But a number of Republicans did not. In the next election, their candidate, Benjamin Harrison, defeated Cleveland.</p>
<p>Cleveland returned to being a lawyer in New York.</p>
<p>In 1892, Cleveland was chosen to run against Benjamin Harrison again. The tariff issue returned: the Republicans' protective tariffs had hurt some industries, and voters answered this time by voting Harrison out of office.</p>
<p>Cleveland returned to the White House. But this time he was not alone.</p>
<p><strong>White House wedding</strong></p>
<p>Two years into his first term as president, Cleveland married the daughter of his close friend, Oscar Folsom.</p>
<p>The bride's name was Frances Folsom. She was 21 years old at the time. The president was 49.</p>
<p>Cleveland was not the first president to get married while in office. But he was the first one to be married in the White House.</p>
<p>The event <strong>captivated</strong> the public. What's more, Americans adored the new first lady. She was known for being social, charming, and beautiful. Historians conclude that she was the most popular first lady since Dolley Madison. She remains the youngest.</p>
<p><strong>Second presidential term</strong></p>
<p>When the Clevelands returned to the White House, the country was entering a severe economic recession. Some of the country's biggest businesses were failing, including a railroad and many banks.</p>
<p>As a result, investors withdrew their money from the stock market. The withdrawal caused many other businesses to fail. The series of events is known as the Panic of 1893.</p>
<p>Soon, more and more Americans were out of work. Many could not afford houses or food. Some begged President Cleveland to intervene. But he declined. He did not think it was the role of the federal government to create jobs in order to reverse the depression.</p>
<p>However, Cleveland did use the power of the federal government to intervene during a famous labor strike. In that event, workers in Chicago who helped keep the trains operating walked out of their jobs. They were protesting a major decrease in their pay that did not include a decrease in their living expenses.</p>
<p>Since the owner of the company also controlled the price of housing and food, workers appealed to him to treat them more fairly. But the company owner refused even to meet with the workers.</p>
<p>Soon, the workers' boycott grew. Workers at other railyards stopped working. Farmers could not get their goods to market, and others could not get the supplies they needed. Even the mail stopped being delivered.</p>
<p>So Cleveland sent federal troops to break the strike.</p>
<p>In the short term, Cleveland's actions worked. The trains moved again, and both the courts and most of the public agreed with the president's decision.</p>
<p>But in the long term, Cleveland's handling of the panic, depression, and workers' strike lost the support of many voters. At the next opportunity, they voted him out of the White House again.</p>
<p><strong>Cleveland's legacy</strong></p>
<p>Cleveland returned to New York, and later settled in a large house in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
<p>There, he wrote, made speeches, sat on corporate boards, became a <strong>trustee</strong> of Princeton University and enjoyed the respect of the people who lived in the town.</p>
<p>He died at age 71 of problems with his stomach, heart, and kidneys. Several people said his final words were, "I have tried so hard to do right."</p>
<p>Then and now, many people agreed with that idea. Cleveland was generally an honest man who worked hard and tried to act independently as president.</p>
<p>But he is not considered one of America's best leaders. He did not have a clear idea about how to guide the country.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the opposing party, at least, may have considered Cleveland's presidency a success. After Cleveland's final election defeat, six of the next seven presidents were Republicans.</p>

<p>French designer Mathieu Lehanneur created the torch, which is 70 centimeters long and made of lightweight steel. Lehanneur said its shape is inspired by the famous Seine river, which flows through Paris. He said the torch is equal from top to bottom and all around the middle, which stands for equality between athletes. The twisting shape of the torch represents peace.<br/>
法国设计师马修·勒汉纽尔设计了这款火炬，它长70厘米，由轻钢制成。勒汉纽尔表示，火炬形状受到了流经巴黎的著名的塞纳河的启发。他说，火炬从上到下以及中部都是对称的，它象征着着运动员之间的平等。火炬曲线的形状象征着和平。</p>
<p>The torch was made with lightweight steel. Its lower half copies the movement of the Seine, along which the opening ceremony will take place for over 500,000 viewers.<br/>
火炬是用轻钢制成的。它的下半部分重现了塞纳河的流动，开幕式将沿着塞纳河举行，届时将有50多万观众观看。</p>
<p>Lehanneur said he wants the torch to represent the kind of event that Paris 2024 hopes to be. "I wanted to move away from the torch appearing as an object of conquest," Lehanneur said.<br/>
勒汉纽尔表示，他希望火炬能呈现2024年巴黎奥运会所希望的那种活动。勒汉纽尔表示：“我想摆脱火炬被视为征服对象的形象。”</p>
<p>He also told reporters that designing the torch was much more technical than he thought it would be. "The magic is not the torch itself, but the flame," Lehanneur said.<br/>
他还告诉记者，火炬的设计比他想象的更有技术性。勒汉纽尔表示：““神奇的不是火炬本身，而是火焰。”</p>
<p>The torch will begin burning in Olympia, Greece, where the first Olympics were held, on April 16. The Games will begin in Paris on July 26, 2024.<br/>
火炬将于明年4月16日在首届奥运会举办地希腊奥林匹亚点燃。这届奥运会将于2024年7月26日在巴黎开幕。</p>
<p>On May 8, the torch will arrive in the Mediterranean city of Marseille. It will then pass through several important places, which include Strasbourg, the Pantheon in Paris, the Mont Saint-Michel and multiple French territories.<br/>
明年5月8日，火炬将抵达地中海城市马赛。然后，它将经过几个重要的地方，包括斯特拉斯堡、巴黎万神殿、圣米歇尔山和多处法国领土。</p>
<p>Tony Estanguet, the Paris 2024 chief, said the torch is "very, very beautiful." He also said it is "...very pure. It's perfectly balanced in the hand."<br/>
2024年巴黎奥运会主席托尼·埃斯坦盖表示，火炬“非常、非常美丽”。他还表示，火炬“非常纯净。它在手中完美地平衡。”</p>

<p>Hi there. This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "environment" and "climate."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Hello, VOA learning English, </span></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-597f-08db8eb831f3_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p><span style="color:#242424">My name is Sukhwant, and I am from India. I have a question about the difference between "environment" and "climate." </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Thank you so much,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Sukhwant</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Thank you, Sukhwant, for this important question!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">"Climate" is part of the "environment." Let's look at the meanings of each.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Let's start with "environment."</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#242424">Environment</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">"Environment" has many meanings. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Your "environment" can be everything that surrounds you. Different conditions and objects make up your environment. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">My home environment is a peaceful place that includes my husband and my pets. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">"Environment" can also be social and cultural elements that contribute to your life or a community.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">The phrase "nature or <strong>nurture</strong>" describes the debate about whether your biology or your environment shapes you. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">When we are talking about science, the "environment" is all the physical, biological and chemical conditions around you. The "environment" includes things like climate, geography, <strong>diversity </strong>of plants and animals and many other things. The environment affects the condition and survival of the things within it. And those things, likewise, affect the environment. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">Deserts are environments with land features like sand or dry ground and extreme temperatures of hot and cold. </span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">We must protect our environment.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Note that the word "environment" can be used in specific professions like computer science and linguistics, or the study of language. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Let's move onto "climate." </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#242424">Climate </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">"Climate" has several different meanings. In science, "climate" is the overall weather <strong>pattern</strong> for an area over time. Climate includes amounts of rain and snow, temperatures and other weather conditions. Climate is part of the environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">"Climate" also can describe an area that has a certain kind of climate.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">She moved to the southern US last year for the warmer climate. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">And lastly, "climate" can mean a general atmosphere or situation in a place or period.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#242424">The political climate of 1950s in the United States was marked by fears about the spread of communism. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#242424">Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you,</span><span style="color:#242424"> Sukhwant.</span></p>
<p>Do you have a question about American English? <span style="color:#242424">Send us an email </span><span style="color:black">at </span><a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com">learningenglish@voanews.com</a><span style="color:black">.</span></p>

            <title>AI Method Creates Six Language Versions of K-Pop Song  (2023/7/28)</title>

<p>A South Korean music production company is using a method of artificial intelligence (AI) to create different language versions of pop music songs.</p>
<p>The company using the method is HYBE. The company represents and produces music for some of South Korea's top pop music performers. Korean pop music is also known as K-pop.</p>
<p>The AI method combines voice recordings of South Korean pop stars with recordings of song <strong>lyrics</strong> read by native speakers of other languages. The process aims to produce complete K-pop songs in multiple languages.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="HYBE IM President Chung Wooyong speaks during an interview with Reuters at a company office in Seoul, South Korea, June 22, 2023. (REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-55b9-08db8939f978_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">HYBE IM President Chung Wooyong speaks during an interview with Reuters at a company office in Seoul, South Korea, June 22, 2023. (REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji)</span></div>
<p>Officials at HYBE say the method does not change the singer's natural voice. Instead, it uses AI to produce different language versions of the same song.</p>
<p>In May, the AI method successfully created a song by K-pop singer MIDNATT in six languages – Korean, English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese. The 40-year-old artist, whose real name is Lee Hyun, recorded the song <em>Masquerade</em> in each language.</p>
<p>Chung Wooyong is the head of HYBE's interactive media department. He explained the creation process to reporters with Reuters news agency. He said the process involved dividing groups of sounds into separate elements. These included things like <strong>pronunciation</strong>, voice <strong>tone</strong> and sound level.</p>
<p>Wooyong added that the technical team's members then "used their imagination" to see what kind of results they could get from the technology. HYBE says the "deep learning" method permitted a first in the music industry – releasing the same song in multiple languages at the same time.</p>
<p>The song is the latest sign of the growing influence of AI in the music industry. AI-produced music has been flooding online music services and social media in recent months. The American-based Grammy Awards recently introduced new rules for AI-created music. In general, the rules aim to protect the music of "human creators" over works created by AI systems.</p>
<p>Wooyong said HYBE is currently considering how to use the AI method in its future music production operations. He noted the technology could be provided to other music creators and the public. Wooyong did not say whether the company would charge others to use the system in the future.</p>
<p>MIDNATT said using the AI method had given him a "wider <strong>spectrum</strong> of artistic expressions." He added, "I feel that the language barrier has been lifted and it's much easier for <strong>global</strong> fans to have an <strong>immersive</strong> experience with my music."</p>
<p>While the technology is not new, this method demonstrates a new way to use AI in music, said Valerio Velardo. He is the director of The Sound of AI, a Spain-based company that advises organizations on AI music and audio development.</p>
<p>Velardo added that he thinks such methods can help professional musicians and the general public in the future. "It's going to lower the barrier of music creation," he said. "It's a little bit like Instagram for pictures, but in the case of music."</p>
<p>For now, HYBE's AI method takes "weeks or months" to do its job, said <em>Masquerade</em> producer Choi Jin-woo, who also uses the name Hitchhiker. However, he noted that when the process speeds up, it could serve a wider range of purposes, such as <strong>interpreting</strong> languages in video conferences.</p>

            <title>Unrest in Niger Raises New Questions About Security in West Africa  (2023/7/28)</title>

<p>Wednesday's attempt by military members to seize power in Niger puts the West African country's security into question.</p>
<p>A group of soldiers said late Wednesday they had ousted democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, however, the president's Twitter account released a message saying he and his family were safe. It said other military members planned to support the president.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Supporters of Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum gather to show their support for him in Niamey on July 26, 2023.

(Photo by AFP)</span></div>
<p>The leadership situation in Niger creates a question of what will happen to the West African country that is campaigning against religious extremism.</p>
<p>Western nations, including France and the U.S., have considered Niger to be a <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_0uvExBkM">democratic ally</a>. Both countries have about 1,000 soldiers in Niger. The soldiers are there to support the country if it is attacked by Islamic extremist fighters.</p>
<p>France has been active in the area, offering similar support to the nearby countries of Mali and Burkina Faso. The French soldiers, however, left Mali in late in 2022 after tensions with the country's military leadership.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Niger in March. He called the country a "model of democracy." Blinken announced $150 million in aid while he was there.</p>
<p><strong>Concern about western support</strong></p>
<p>The military leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso use the Russian Wagner Group for military support. The concern is that Niger will do something similar, removing any western influence from the area.</p>
<p>Paul Melly is an Africa expert at the Chatham House research group in London. Before the military action on Wednesday, he said Niger had been open to working with international partners. "So, quite a lot is at stake here," he added.</p>
<p>Melly pointed to one important difference between what is happening in Niger and other nations in the area whose leaders have been ousted.</p>
<p>In Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso, the people on the streets supported the military <strong>coup</strong>. In Niger, Melly said, that was not what happened. People were supporting Bazoum, the president.</p>
<p><strong>Future of western positions</strong></p>
<p>Western nations are concerned about Niger because they have used the country as an operations base in actions against extremist fighters.</p>
<p>The concern is that a leadership change in Niger will limit what western countries can do to fight terrorist groups in West Africa and the Sahel. The Sahel is the area south of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>In 2021, the United States said it had supported Niger with over $500 million of military aid and training since 2012. Earlier in 2023, the European Union started a $30 million training program in Niger. The U.S. is known to have a <strong>drone</strong> base it uses to fight militant extremists in the northern part of Niger.</p>
<p>John Manley is a spokesman for the U.S. Africa Command. He said it is too soon to know how the coup attempt in Niger will affect U.S. activities in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Other African nations are worried</strong></p>
<p>Other African nations say they are worried that fighting in the northern part of West Africa will move south. Omar Touray is president of the ECOWAS Commission. ECOWAS is the economic group formed by 15 West African nations.</p>
<p>Touray recently told the United Nations that extremist fighting could move into Ghana and Ivory Coast if Niger loses western support. West African nations say there were about 1,800 extremist attacks this year resulting in almost 4,600 deaths – mostly in Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>

<p>Imagine you are at a library – a place where books, movies, and other publications are available to borrow.</p>
<p>What kinds of terms and structures would you need to know in order to express yourself well at a library?</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore one possible answer to that question: phrasal verbs.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar - Library phrases" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-9d1b-08db8eb47ad1_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar - Library phrases</span></div>
<p><strong>Definition </strong></p>
<p>Phrasal verbs are groups of words made up of a verb and another short word or words. Together, these groups of words mean something different from what the individual words suggest. As a result, you can think of phrasal verbs as kinds of special expressions.</p>
<p>We will now explore three phrasal verbs that connect to the library: look up, look for, and check out.</p>
<p><strong>Look up </strong></p>
<p>Our first phrasal verb is "look up." "Look up" means to search for something in a <strong>reference</strong> book, publication, or on the internet.</p>
<p>We often use a noun or noun phrase after "look up." For example, you might say:</p>
<p><em>I need to look up an <strong>article</strong>. </em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>I need to look up a news story.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>I need to look up that word in the <strong>dictionary</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Look for </strong></p>
<p>Our second phrasal verb is "look for." "Look for" means to try to find something or to search for something. "Look for" is often followed by a noun or noun phrase.</p>
<p>You might look for general things or specific things.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to find science <strong>fiction</strong> books at the library, you could say:</p>
<p><em>I am looking for science fiction books. </em></p>
<p>If you wanted to find an exact book, you might say something like this:</p>
<p><em>I am looking for "Dune" by Frank Herbert.</em></p>
<p><strong>Check out </strong></p>
<p>Our third phrasal verb is "check out." "Check out" means to borrow something from a library.</p>
<p>So, you might say:</p>
<p><em>I went to the library to check out new books. </em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>I checked out a book from the library. </em></p>
<p><strong>Combine </strong></p>
<p>So, we have our three phrasal verbs for the library: look up, look for, and check out.</p>
<p>We can think of these phrasal verbs as taking place in steps. Perhaps look up is step one, look for is step two, and check out is step three.</p>
<p>For example, you might look up book <strong>reviews</strong>. After you read a book review that covers an interesting book, you might look for the book itself. After you find the book, you might check out the book.</p>
<p><strong>Practice </strong></p>
<p>Let's take some time to work with these ideas. Imagine you have a book that you want to borrow from the library. How can you ask to borrow it? Use the phrasal verb "check out. "</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one answer:</p>
<p><em>Can I check out this book? </em></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts </strong></p>
<p>In today's report, we explored some useful phrasal verbs for the library. There are other phrasal verbs for the library, but the three we explored today are probably the most common ones you will find.</p>

<span class="datetime">26 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Several major news organizations have teamed up with artificial intelligence (AI) developers to find new tools to help <strong>journalists</strong> do their work.</p>
<p>AI developer OpenAI recently signed a deal with the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.theajp.org/">American Journalism Project</a> (AJP) to use AI tools to support local news across the United States. OpenAI is backed by American software maker Microsoft. The AJP is a nonprofit group that provides financial assistance to local nonprofit U.S. news organizations.</p>
<p>Late last year, OpenAI released an AI tool called ChatGPT. ChatGPT and other so-called "chatbots" have demonstrated the ability to lead human-like discussions and produce complex writing based on short, written commands. Such tools are also known as "generative AI" or "large language models."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The logo for OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, appears on a mobile phone, in New York, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/800f0000-c0a8-0242-0191-08db03d3882b_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The logo for OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, appears on a mobile phone, in New York, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>In its deal with the AJP, OpenAI promised to provide $5 million to expand the project's work and strengthen local journalism efforts. OpenAI is also offering the AJP an additional $5 million to help local news organizations deploy the latest AI tools.</p>
<p>Sarabeth Berman is head of the American Journalism Project. She <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.theajp.org/news-insights/announcements/american-journalism-project-announces-new-partnership-with-openai-to-support-local-news/">said in a statement</a> the cooperation with OpenAI aims to ensure that local news organizations can help shape the ways AI is used in journalism. Berman added, the partnership seeks to find ways for AI to improve journalism, "rather than <strong>imperil</strong>" it.</p>
<p>In addition, the partnership aims to support AJP's efforts to "create healthier information <strong>ecosystems</strong>" at the local level to fight misinformation in news. The deal will help create a <strong>studio</strong> that can be used by local news organizations to experiment with OpenAI's technology.</p>
<p>The AJP's deal with OpenAI is one of several partnerships recently established between AI developers and news organizations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it had signed a deal with The Associated Press to <strong>license</strong> the news agency's collection of news stories. OpenAI will use AP's news stories to train and develop its chatbot tool. No financial details of the deal were announced.</p>
<p>In addition, the two companies said in a statement they are examining how the AP could use "generative AI in news products and services."</p>
<p>The deal came after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) informed OpenAI it had opened an investigation into whether the company had taken part in unfair business activities. The investigation reportedly centers on whether OpenAI violated trade rules by training its language model on publicly available data.</p>
<p>Some news organizations, book writers and other creative artists have brought legal actions or sought <strong>compensation</strong> from companies that used their works to train AI systems.</p>
<p>The AP said it currently does not use any generative AI in its news story production. But it has long used other forms of AI. This includes a system that <strong>automatically </strong>produces corporate earnings stories and some sports reports.</p>
<p>U.S.-based search engine Google also recently confirmed it was in talks with major news publishers about using a new AI tool it developed to help journalists report and write their stories. The project was first reported by <em>The New York Times. </em>The tool is being tested by the <em>Times</em>, as well as <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, the French news agency AFP reported.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> said the AI tool – which Google calls Genesis – was still in early form testing. However, a demonstration of the system reportedly left newspaper officials "unsettled" when they saw the tool's abilities.</p>
<p>A Google spokeswoman confirmed in a statement the company had held discussions with news publishers on providing AI-based tools "to help their journalists with their work." The tool being tested was designed to do things like help journalists choose <strong>headlines</strong> and write in different <strong>styles</strong>, the <em>Times</em> reported.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that such tools were not meant to "replace the <strong>essential</strong> role journalists have in reporting, creating and fact-checking" their stories.</p>

<span class="datetime">26 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>A year before the Paris Olympic Games, officials overseeing many of the sports on the 2024 program have not agreed on how to treat Russian <strong>athletes</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasingly, different governing bodies are permitting Russian athletes to take part in Olympic competitions as neutral competitors without their national flag or <strong>anthem</strong>.</p>
<p>At first, most Olympic sports barred Russians from competing soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Russian flag is held above the Olympic Rings at Adler Arena Skating Center during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia on Feb. 18, 2014.

<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it strongly supports those moves although the body says it has not decided if athletes from Russia and Belarus can compete at the Paris Games. However, the IOC has delayed action on the one sport whose <strong>qualification</strong> it controls: boxing.</p>
<p>Most of the sports that have permitted Russians to return followed IOC advice on what to call Russian athletes. They call them "individual <strong>neutral</strong> athletes." The sports groups are continuing to ban Russians who are under contract with the Russian military. They also ban athletes who have publicly supported the war in Ukraine. The IOC also suggests blocking Russia from team sports like soccer or basketball.</p>
<p>Ukraine is opposed to any Russians competing. Since last year, Ukrainian athletes and national teams have not been competing in events permitting Russians. The Ukrainian government banned its athletes in team sports to compete against Russian teams. Ukraine supporters have been <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_V53iCtW6">looking</a> through Russian athletes' social media accounts for pro-war posts that could disqualify them from competing.</p>
<p>Here is what the Associated Press says about the situation in a few major Olympic sports:</p>
<p><strong>Track and field</strong></p>
<p>The sports group World Athletics governs track and field sports. It banned athletes from Russia and Belarus from competitions after the invasion of Ukraine. That ban remains in place "for the <strong>foreseeable</strong> future," after a vote of the World Athletics governing group in March. President Sebastian Coe said at the time that deaths and destruction in Ukraine have only "hardened" the decision to keep a ban in place.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming</strong></p>
<p>World Aquatics is the group that governs swimming. It is one of the sports taking Russia's return slowly. It has said it favors Russia and Belarus returning to its different sports, but it set up a group to study the issue, which will report in late July. That means no Russians can compete at the world championships this month in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>Tennis</strong></p>
<p>Men's and women's tennis permits individual Russian or Belarusian players. But the sport punished some competitions, including Wimbledon, which enforced restrictions.</p>
<p>Ukrainian players continue to compete but often do not shake hands with Russians or Belarusians. Aryna Sabalenka is from Belarus. She won the Australian Open in January. She also has been questioned about her past support for Belarus' <strong>authoritarian</strong> leader, President Alexander Lukashenko. She has said she does not support the war.</p>
<p>Russian and Belarusian players are barred from national team competitions like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. The International Tennis Federation has not made a final decision on the Olympics. But it has a lot of time because qualification is decided by the June 2024 world positions.</p>
<p><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p>
<p>Those that compete in the sport gymnastics from Russia and Belarus will be permitted to take part in <strong>sanctioned</strong> competitions as "individual neutral athletes" from the start of 2024.</p>
<p>The world Championships are to be held in early October in Belgium.</p>
<p>Russian gymnasts have been some of the loudest supporters of the war. Days after the invasion, Ivan Kuliak wore a pro-war "Z" <strong>symbol </strong>on a competition stand while next to a Ukrainian athlete. He was suspended for a year. Other Russian gymnasts appeared on stage at an event to support the war. And Olympic gold medalist Nikita Nagornyy heads a military youth organization in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Team Sports</strong></p>
<p>The IOC supports banning Russia from team sports and no Olympic sport has gone against that decision. The IOC also suggests a ban on "team events in individual sports" like the team all-around in gymnastics.</p>

<span class="datetime">26 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Scientists say that a body of water at the southern end of Florida reached a new high temperature of over 38 degrees Celsius early this week.</p>
<p>Weather scientists, called meteorologists, say they measured the high seawater temperatures in Manatee Bay on both Sunday and Monday. They believe the water temperature may be the world's highest ever recorded. A floating device that sends information to the U.S. weather agency, NOAA, recorded the temperature.</p>
<p>A 2020 study showed that Kuwait Bay reached 37.6 degrees Celsius. That was thought to be the highest-ever water temperature.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provide by NOAA, shows a dead coral at Cheeca Rocks off the coast of Islamorada, Fla., on July 23, 2023.

<p>Jeff <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_8qDsErCW">Masters</a> is a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections, a weather news service. "This is a hot tub," he said. A hot tub is a heated water pool many people use for treating sore muscles. Jacuzzi, a company that makes hot tubs, recommends a water temperature of about 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_QOcI2S4t">Masters</a> and Brian McNoldy, a meteorologist at the University of Miami, both said the temperatures might not be an official record because the water is close to land and contains sea grass.</p>
<p>However, McNoldy said, "it's <strong>amazing</strong>."</p>
<p>The high temperatures could put sea life, such as coral, in danger.</p>
<p>Andrew Ibarra is a researcher for NOAA. He took a small boat out to the area called Cheeca Rocks to look at coral and said, "I found that the <strong>entire</strong> reef was bleached out."</p>
<p>Bleaching is when coral loses its color. It is a sign that the sea creatures are in danger of dying.</p>
<p>Ian Enochs studies coral for NOAA. He said coral bleaching was almost never seen before the 1980s. Now, he said, "We've reached the point where it's become <strong>routine</strong>."</p>
<p>Enochs added that the amount of bleaching he sees this early in the year makes him "nervous."</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_G3M5y4eV">high water</a> temperature in Florida goes along with all-time high sea surface temperatures in April, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_Y4aOkRht">May</a> and June. NOAA also said water temperatures in the North Atlantic, near the Canadian <strong>province</strong> of Newfoundland are five to six degrees Celsius warmer than usual.</p>

            <title>In Hollywood Strike, AI’s Part Is Important  (2023/7/26)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Labor unions for actors and writers are striking over pay, <strong>benefits</strong> and job protections. But Artificial intelligence technology has become a big issue in Hollywood's labor fight.</p>
<p>AI has introduced a new point of disagreement between artists and production companies. Here is a look at what both sides say they want.</p>
<p><strong>Why is AI such an important issue?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Members of the The Writers Guild of America picket outside Fox Studios on Tuesday, May 2, 2023, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-f774-08db8d411d6e_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Members of the The Writers Guild of America picket outside Fox Studios on Tuesday, May 2, 2023, in Los Angeles.

<p>With AI, star actors fear they will lose control of their <strong>likenesses</strong>. Unknown actors fear they will be replaced altogether. Writers fear they will have to share credit with or lose credit to machines.</p>
<p>The proposed <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_WV5r2OMR">contracts</a> which the two sides have been attempting to negotiate is to last only three years. Even at the speed at which AI technology is developing, it is unlikely there would be a large displacement of writers or actors within that period of time. But unions and employers know that if they compromise on an issue, it will be harder to get what they want in the next set of negotiations.</p>
<p>New technology is important to filmmaking. AI has been used to make actors look younger, like Harrison Ford in the recent film <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>.</p>
<p>All sides in the strike know that use of new technology will continue to increase. That is why both sides are looking to establish legal and creative control.</p>
<p><strong>The actors' view</strong><br/>
<br/>
Actors in the labor discussions are represented by the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) represents the production companies, which are the employers. The strike started on July 13.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA released an opinion of the studios' position on the use of AI and their images. The group said the production companies want "...to <strong>scan</strong> a background performer's image, pay them for a half a day's labor, and then use an individual's likeness for any purpose forever without their <strong>consent."</strong></p>
<p>The union also said employers want "...to be able to make changes to...<strong>dialogue</strong>, and even create new <strong>scenes</strong>, without informed consent."</p>
<p>The AMPTP said in a statement that its offers included an "AI proposal which protects performers' digital likenesses, including a requirement for performers' consent for the creation...of a performance."</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA said it wants to protect "human-created work" including changes to the "voice, likeness or performance" of an actor.</p>
<p>Observers say that "voice" comes first on that list for a reason. AI voice technology might be more developed than visual technology. For example, the voices of the late Anthony Bourdain and the late Andy Warhol have both been recreated for recent films.</p>
<p><strong>Writers want credit</strong></p>
<p>During the writers' contract talks, which broke down in early May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) said it did not oppose the use of AI. But AI should only be used as a tool to use in a writer's own work.</p>
<p>The union said writers might be willing to shape stories with help from AI software. But they did not want it to affect the credits that influence their position and pay.</p>
<p>The WGA wants to prevent entirely AI-created stories or dialogue from being considered "literary material<span style="color:black">." This means they would not be competing with computers for credit.</span></p>
<p>The AMPTP said in a document explaining its position that writers "want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can't be <strong>copyrighted</strong>."</p>
<p>"Only a ‘person' can be considered a writer," the AMPTP added. "AI-generated material would not be <strong>eligible</strong> for writing credit."</p>
<p>This position could calm writers' worries about sharing credit with AI. But it could also lead to no one getting credit when they use AI.</p>
<p>Modern movie writing contracts are very complex and hard to understand. So is the question of who receives credit for the work. Observers say adding AI makes the problem even more difficult.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202307/south-korean-court-overturns-removal-of-minister-over-deadly-crowd-crush.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>South Korea's top court has overturned a parliamentary vote that removed the country's public safety minister over a deadly crowd incident in October.<br/>
韩国最高法院推翻了国会因去年10月发生的一起致命踩踏事件而罢免该国公共安全部长的投票。</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday to lift the impeachment of Lee Sang-min. Lee was serving as South Korea's Minister of the Interior and Safety when 159 people were crushed to death in a densely packed crowd during a Halloween celebration last October in Seoul.<br/>
韩国宪法法院星期二裁定撤销对李相民的弹劾。去年10月在首尔举行的万圣节庆祝活动中，有159人在密集人流中被踩踏致死，当时李相民正担任韩国内政安全部部长。</p>
<p>The court's decision permits Lee to return to his position, which had been filled by an acting minister. South Korea's opposition-controlled parliament voted in February to impeach Lee. Legislators sought to hold him responsible for the government's failure to put in place effective crowd control measures.<br/>
该法院裁决允许李相民官复原职，该职位之前由代理部长担任。韩国反对派控制的国会在2月投票弹劾了李相民。国会议员试图追究他对政府未能采取有效措施控制人流的责任。</p>
<p>In its rejection of Lee's impeachment, the Constitutional Court suggested that he alone could not be held responsible for the crowd crush. The court said it had not found enough evidence to prove that Lee had failed to carry out his legal and constitutional duties to protect the public's safety.<br/>
宪法法院在驳回对李相民的弹劾时表示，不能仅由他对人群踩踏事件负责。法院表示，没有找到足够的证据证明李相民未履行其保护公众安全的法律和宪法职责。</p>
<p>Instead, the court blamed a number of different government agencies for failing to "develop a combined ability to respond to large-scale disasters."<br/>
相反，法院指责另一些政府机构未能“发挥应对大规模灾难的综合能力”。</p>

<p>Agricultural emissions are getting more attention from U.S. officials, researchers, and industry professionals. One big area of debate is the link between carbon storage and carbon markets.</p>
<p><strong>New Policies </strong></p>
<p>Last week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $300 million investment to monitor agricultural emissions. The investment will help create a research group to monitor carbon levels in soil.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Shalamar Armstrong, associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University, holds a shovel full of soil, Thursday, July 13, 2023, in Fowler, Ind.

(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)</span></div>
<p>American lawmakers also proposed a measure to support research needed to "properly credit soil carbon storage."</p>
<p>The USDA announcement and the law are both aimed at the difficult question of how to measure carbon stored in soil. The issue is important if the young soil carbon market is to avoid the opposition directed at current carbon credit markets.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon storage </strong></p>
<p>The Congressional Research Services describes a carbon market as an economic idea "that supports the buying and selling of environmental <strong>commodities</strong> that <strong>signify</strong> GHG (greenhouse gas) emission reductions" or storage.</p>
<p>The general idea is that some kinds of farming methods can support carbon storage. As a result, some farmers can get money in the form of carbon offsets — payments that companies can make that support carbon storage in farms.</p>
<p>Shalamar Armstrong is an associate professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. "The more carbon you store from the atmosphere with your crops, and the more crops grown throughout the year, you offset some of your waste," he said. The carbon that was stored would have instead been released into the atmosphere, he explained.</p>
<p>But much about carbon storage remains unknown.</p>
<p>"The science piece (of carbon credits) has really <strong>lagged</strong> behind, particularly when it comes to things like monitoring, reporting and <strong>verification</strong>," said Cristel Zoebisch, a policy director at climate organization Carbon180.</p>
<p>Armstrong has been trying to help fix the problem of measuring carbon storage. He runs a lab where researchers are investigating how farming method affects the amount of carbon in soil across different kinds of land. He and others at Purdue have been studying soil samples that date back more than 40 years.</p>
<p>He hopes his findings will help farmers make decisions that could result in earnings from storing carbon and without losing any crop profit.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon markets </strong></p>
<p>But other experts worry that even if farmers do get paid for storing soil carbon, bigger issues remain.</p>
<p>Carbon offsets in the U.S. have to meet four conditions. They have to store carbon that would otherwise be released. The offsets also have to be verifiable in data, immediate and long-lasting, said John Sterman, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Carbon storage research might make the offsets more verifiable, but such research does not deal with other problems.</p>
<p>For example, many American farmers do not own the land on which they grow crops. As a result, these farmers cannot guarantee that carbon stored on their land will stay in place if someone else works the same property.</p>
<p>Barbara Haya of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at University of California, Berkeley, says the research she has worked on shows that the effects of carbon offset projects are commonly overestimated. Carbon trading has, in her words, "failed miserably" over the last 20 years. She advises moving away from the process.</p>
<p>Jared Huffman, a lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives, last month proposed a bill to support farmers in making improvements to soil health. He said farmers in the area he represents would be interested in entering carbon markets with strong accounting systems. But he added that those hoping for serious climate action should not depend only on offsets.</p>

<p>Words are all around us and not just in books. Students need to know that words have meaning. Educators call this print awareness. At this early stage,<strong> </strong>surround learners with English words and sounds.</p>
<p>Experts say that students who cannot read in their own language may not understand some literacy ideas. They need to be taught about the <strong>functions</strong> of print.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Print Awareness" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3d91-08db40586daf_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Print Awareness</span></div>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for print awareness</strong></p>
<p><u>Bring in common items with written language – both the home language and English.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring in calendars, food packages, magazines, mail, maps, and newspapers. Talk about these items. Compare English words with words from the home language.</li>
<li>Create fun activities with the items. For example, as an art project students can make a birthday card for a friend or family member. They could also make their own food product and make packaging for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Post words in your classroom.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Label</strong> common objects in the classroom.</li>
<li>Post words to songs and poems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Post the names and birthdays of students in the classroom.</li>
<li>Hang colorful <strong>posters</strong> with English words on the walls.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_KFE8OaWU"><u>Read</u></a><u> often to your class. </u></p>
<p>Read books that:</p>
<ul>
<li>fit the age and English level of your students.</li>
<li>repeat simple and useful sentences and words.</li>
<li>have limited text on a page with pictures explaining the text.</li>
<li>have active stories.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Make reading aloud fun and active!</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions about the story. Talk about important words or ideas. But do not stop too often. Students may lose interest in the story.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use fun voices, facial expressions, music, objects, and pictures to make the story come to life.</li>
<li>Make connections to real life. Ask them, "Has this happened to you?"</li>
<li>Have students retell the story or change the story somehow.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Teach the parts of a book and different types of books.</u></p>
<p>As you read to your students, teach the parts of a book. Talk about different types of books.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the purpose of a book's title and where it is found.</li>
<li>Point out the names of the author and illustrator. Explain their jobs.</li>
<li>Show students the page numbers. Explain why pages are numbered.</li>
<li>Use many different books such as comics and picture books.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Talk about different part of the story.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the story about (who are the <strong>characters</strong>)?</li>
<li>Where does the story take place (the <strong>setting</strong>)?</li>
<li>Talk about the problem and the solution. How do characters fix the problem?</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Teach <strong>punctuation</strong> when you read with your students.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Point out periods, exclamation points, and question marks. Explain what they do.</li>
<li>Show how punctuation changes the meaning of a sentence.</li>
<li>Read a sentence with a period and then with an exclamation point with excitement!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment for print awareness</strong></p>
<p>Early learners may not have print awareness. To assess or test for print awareness, give a student a book and ask questions. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the title of the book?</li>
<li>Can you show me the author's name?</li>
<li>Where does the story begin?</li>
<li>Can you show me <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_tDoBBxJ4">a letter</a>? A word? A sentence?</li>
<li>Can you find the first and last words of a sentence?</li>
<li>Can you show me a punctuation mark? What does a question mark do?</li>
<li>Can you show me a capital letter? Can you show me a lowercase letter?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve you and your learners. Change methods to fit your students' abilities and the teaching situation.</p>

<span class="datetime">24 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Twitter owner Elon Musk has launched a new <strong>logo </strong>– the single letter "X" – to replace the social media service's famous blue bird.</p>
<p>The X design started appearing at the top of Twitter's computer version on Monday. But the old bird logo could still be seen across areas of the service.</p>
<p>Musk announced in a Twitter message Sunday that he had decided to change the company's logo. He said he had asked his millions of followers to provide logo ideas and if they would favor a change in the service's colors from blue to black.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A view of a lap top and monitors showing the Twitter signing in page displaying the new logo, in Belgrade, Serbia, Monday, July 24, 2023.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)</span></div>
<p>When asked what tweets would be called without the blue bird logo, Musk said they would now be known as "Xs."</p>
<p>The latest change is one in a series Musk has carried out since buying Twitter for $44 billion last year.</p>
<p>The billionaire businessman dismissed about 75 percent of the company's workforce soon after the deal closed. Musk said the move was necessary to make Twitter more effective and increase profits. He also announced plans to start charging Twitter users eight dollars a month to keep a <strong>verified</strong> account.</p>
<p>As Twitter chief, Musk also lifted some existing restrictions on user <strong>content</strong>. He said those changes were part of a larger effort to protect the free speech of Twitter users. Critics said his plans were likely to increase the amount of harmful content and hate speech appearing on the service.</p>
<p>Musk's changes led to drops in the number of Twitter users. Some advertisers stopped doing business with the company, as well.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683353772917940225">In a message</a> on Twitter Monday, chief executive Linda Yaccarino wrote, "X is here! Let's do this." Along with her message, she published a picture of the logo projected onto the building's headquarters in San Francisco</p>
<p>Musk also commented on the logo change, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673">writing</a>, "And soon we shall <strong>bid adieu</strong> to the twitter <strong>brand</strong> and, <strong>gradually</strong>, all the birds." Musk said the X.com web domain was already redirecting users to Twitter.com.</p>
<p>A three-member team designed the first Twitter logo in 2012. One of those designers, Martin Grasser, described the blue bird logo as "simple, balanced" and easy to read at very small sizes.</p>
<p>Matt Rhodes is with the British creative agency House 337. He told news agency <em>Reuters</em> that making changes to such an established brand presents big business risks. "Anything that makes it harder for people to find, or want to open the <strong>app</strong> on their <strong>cluttered</strong> phone screens risks harming usage," Rhodes said.</p>
<p>However, Paolo Pescatore, a technology and media specialist who founded advisory company PP Foresight, said the change could be good. He spoke to the<em> Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p>Pescatore said social media users currently can get <strong>confused</strong> by too many apps and messaging services to choose from. Driving users to one central place will "<strong>engage</strong>" more users and could make Twitter easier to use, he said.</p>
<p>Musk has long been interested in the letter X. He had already changed Twitter's official name to X Corp after buying the company.</p>
<p>The billionaire is also CEO of rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, commonly known as SpaceX. He started an artificial intelligence company this month called xAI to compete with OpenAI. And in 1999, he founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal.</p>
<p>Musk's Twitter purchase and rebranding effort are seen as steps toward his stated plans to create what he has called an "everything app." Such an app would be similar to China's WeChat, which combines video, messaging, <strong>streaming</strong> and payments.</p>
<p>Yaccarino wrote on Twitter that she sees X becoming "the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities."</p>

            <title>Grow Cutting Garden for Flowers Indoors All Season Long  (2023/7/25)</title>

<p>Almost every flower can be cut and enjoyed indoors. But growing a cutting <strong>garden</strong> of flowers takes some planning.</p>
<p>Jessica Damiano writes about gardening for The Associated Press. Damiano says that she cuts lilacs to bring indoors for their <strong>scent</strong> in the spring. And hydrangeas and roses make it indoors on her dining room table for the summer.</p>
<p>The first step, Damiano says, is to think about flowers as a crop to be harvested. Just as some tomatoes are better for use in sauces, some flowers are better for cutting and showing than others.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This 2022 image provided by SOW Local shows freshly cut ranunculus flowers in Oakdale, N.Y. (Chris Demchak via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/37f3531a-24ea-42fc-9417-05673b3cb3a3_cx0_cy13_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This 2022 image provided by SOW Local shows freshly cut ranunculus flowers in Oakdale, N.Y. (Chris Demchak via AP)</span></div>
<p>Flowers that do not grow tall nor <strong>bloom</strong> are not the best to show indoors. Damiano says to look for this information in seed <strong>catalogs. </strong>The descriptions often include whether specific kinds of flowers, from perennials, annuals or tender perennials, work well for cutting and showing.</p>
<p>Perennials are plants that flower for more than one year. Some flower for just two or three weeks, while others flower repeatedly. And they usually flower in their second year, but sometimes third.</p>
<p>Annuals are plants that live for just one year. But they usually produce more flowers during the growing season.</p>
<p>Tender perennials are perennials in the sense that they live for more than one year. But, they are usually grown as annuals because some do not dependably return and some cannot survive winters.</p>
<p>To ensure a continual supply of flowers for cutting, Damiano says to plant seeds or young plants every two weeks.</p>
<p>Annuals that are good for cutting include cosmos, globe amaranth, larkspur, and Queen Anne's lace. Perennials to grow and cut include bee balm, coneflower, fox glove, lily, and rose. Tender perennials that work well for cutting include California poppy, snapdragon, and strawflower.</p>
<p>Both annuals and perennials can be grown in the ground, in raised beds, or even in containers. If you have enough room, growing them in separate beds will simplify yearly planting. But it is not necessary. If you are short on space, plant where you can.</p>
<p>Most flowers need fertile, well-<strong>draining</strong> soil, repeated watering, and at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day. You can use plants bought from a garden center, start your own from seed indoors, or plant seeds directly into the garden.</p>
<p>Add a large amount of <strong>compost </strong>into planting holes to provide nutrients to the plants. If you're planning ahead, top the soil with five to eight centimeters of compost in the fall, and the bed will be highly fertile by spring.</p>
<p>Beds should not be much wider than a meter. This will help to keep your harvests within easy reach from all sides. When planting, place the tallest flowers at the backside of the bed, middle-sized plants in the center, and smaller plants in the front so that all are easy to get to.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow directions for plants on how much space they need to understand their full-grown size. Plants that do not have enough space often become diseased plants.</p>
<p>After planting, add a balanced, slow-release fertilizer and five to eight centimeters of <strong>mulch</strong>, then water well. If you are planting seeds directly into the garden, fertilize and mulch when the growing plants are 10 centimeters tall.</p>
<p>Beginning three weeks after planting, add a liquid flower fertilizer that is low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus. And repeat every two weeks.</p>

吉尔·拜登还将会见法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的妻子布丽吉特·马克龙。</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the administration of President Joe Biden said rejoining UNESCO was part of the president's goal to strengthen partnerships around the world. The administration also said it shows America's interest in being a U.N. leader.<br/>
乔·拜登总统政府的发言人表示，重新加入联合国教科文组织是拜登总统加强世界各地伙伴关系目标的一部分。拜登政府还表示，这表明美国有兴趣成为联合国领导者。</p>
<p>Others said Jill Biden was the right person to take part in Tuesday's event because of her experience as a teacher and college professor. Elizabeth Alexander is a spokesperson for Biden. She said the first lady is "honored to help celebrate this important milestone."<br/>
另一些人则表示，吉尔·拜登是参加周二活动的合适人选，因为她作为一名教师和大学教授的经验。伊丽莎白·亚历山大是拜登的发言人。她说，第一夫人“很荣幸能共同庆祝这一重要里程碑。”</p>
<p>The U.S. left UNESCO in 2018 during President Donald Trump's time in office. Trump's administration was protesting what it called unfair treatment of Israel by UNESCO.<br/>
美国于2018年唐纳德·特朗普总统任期内退出了联合国教科文组织。特朗普政府是为了抗议联合国教科文组织对以色列的不公平待遇。</p>
<p>UNESCO voted earlier in July to approve the United States' readmission to the group. As part of rejoining UNESCO, the U.S. will pay more than $600 million over a number of coming years. That amount includes what the U.S. would have paid had it been a member since 2018. Clubs, labor groups and other organizations call these amounts dues.<br/>
联合国教科文组织7月早些时候投票批准美国重新加入该组织。作为重新加入联合国教科文组织的一部分，美国将在未来几年支付超过6亿美元。这一数额包括如果美国自2018年以来一直是会员国，它将支付的费用。俱乐部、劳工组织和其他组织称这些款项为会费。</p>
<p>The U.S. also withdrew from UNESCO in the 1980s during Ronald Reagan's presidency. It rejoined the group in 2003 under President George W. Bush. Bush's wife, Laura, announced the move at a UNESCO meeting that year.<br/>
美国也在20世纪80年代罗纳德·里根担任总统期间退出了联合国教科文组织。它于2003年在乔治·W·布什总统的领导下重新加入该组织。布什的夫人劳拉在当年的联合国教科文组织会议上宣布了这一举措。</p>

            <title>NASA’s James Webb Celebrates One Year of Science Discoveries  (2023/7/24) | 美国韦伯望远镜庆祝其首年科学发现</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202307/nasa-s-james-webb-celebrates-one-year-of-science-discoveries.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The James Webb Space Telescope recently celebrated its first year in operation. During that time, the orbiting observatory – operated by the American space agency NASA – produced colorful, detailed images. It has also helped researchers make several new scientific discoveries.<br/>
詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜最近庆祝了其运行的第一年。在此期间，由美国宇航局运营的这座轨道天文台拍摄了丰富多彩的详细图像。它还帮助研究人员做出了一些新的科学发现。</p>
<p>NASA has described the telescope as the largest, most powerful telescope ever sent into space. The agency launched the Webb in late 2021 and released its first images in July 2022.<br/>
美国宇航局称该望远镜是有史以来送入太空的体积最大、功能最强的望远镜。该机构于2021年末发射了韦伯望远镜，并于2022年7月发布了该望远镜拍下的第一张照片。</p>
<p>The Webb's first full-color images were presented by President Joe Biden. One of the images showed the clearest picture yet of the early universe, about 13 billion years ago.<br/>
乔·拜登总统展示了韦伯望远镜拍下的第一张全彩图片。其中一张图片显示了迄今为止最清晰的早期宇宙图片，它的时间大约是在130亿年前。</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson marked the anniversary with a statement. He said, "In just one year, the James Webb Space Telescope has transformed humanity's view of the cosmos, peering into dust clouds and seeing light from faraway corners of the universe for the very first time."<br/>
美国宇航局局长比尔·纳尔逊发表声明纪念韦伯望远镜一周年。他说：“在短短一年的时间里，詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜改变了人类对宇宙的看法，凝视尘埃云，并首次看到了来自宇宙遥远角落的光。”</p>
<p>Most recently, NASA celebrated the Webb's one year anniversary by releasing one of its latest images. The image showed a cloud collection of 50 stars in the process of forming. NASA said the image showed an area of space that is full of hydrogen gas and dust. Scientists said the image was a good representation of this brief period in a star's life.<br/>
最近，美国宇航局发布了一张最新的照片，以此庆祝韦伯望远镜一周年。这张图片显示了一个由50颗正在形成的恒星组成的星云集合。美国宇航局表示，这张图片显示了一个充满氢气和灰尘的太空区域。科学家表示，这张照片很好地再现了恒星生命中这段短暂的时期。</p>
<p>At around the same time, researchers announced they had used data from the Webb to identify the most distant, active supermassive black hole ever observed. Scientists say the black hole sits in a galaxy called CEERS 1019. The galaxy is thought to have existed about 570 million years after the Big Bang – the explosion many scientists believe created the universe.<br/>
大约在同一时间，研究人员宣布，他们已经使用韦伯望远镜的数据来确定有史以来观测到的最遥远、最活跃的超大质量黑洞。科学家表示，这个黑洞位于一个名为CEERS 1019的星系中。该星系被认为存在于大爆炸后约5.7亿年，许多科学家认为大爆炸创造了宇宙。</p>
<p>The black hole discovery and others that received help from the Webb were in part made possible through the telescope's infrared instruments. The instruments collect infrared waves passing through gas and dust that can hide objects in space. The infrared system also shows light from more distant parts of the universe.<br/>
黑洞的发现和其它得到韦伯望远镜帮助的发现在一定程度上是通过该望远镜的红外仪器实现的。这些仪器收集了穿过可以隐藏太空中物体的气体和灰尘的红外波。红外系统还显示了来自宇宙更遥远角落的光。</p>
<p>The Webb's instruments have also confirmed the distances of some of the farthest galaxies ever observed, NASA reported. In addition, the telescope's data has provided more detailed information than ever before about the makeup of planet atmospheres. And the instruments have also led to discoveries about the chemicals and gases that exist around collections of stars and exoplanets outside of our solar system.<br/>
据美国宇航局报道，韦伯望远镜的仪器还证实了目前观测到的最远星系的距离。此外，该望远镜的数据提供了比以往任何时候都更详细的行星大气组成信息。而且这些仪器还发现了太阳系外恒星和系外行星集合周围存在的化学物质和气体。</p>
<p>For example, the Webb helped astronomers observe the most distant molecules known to exist in the universe and also led to the discovery of 12 new moons orbiting Jupiter<br/>
例如，韦伯望远镜号帮助天文学家观测到了宇宙中已知存在的最遥远的分子，还发现了12颗围绕木星运行的新卫星。</p>
<p>In a statement marking the Webb's one year anniversary, NASA noted the telescope had "resulted in hundreds of scientific papers answering longstanding questions and raising new ones."<br/>
在纪念韦伯望远镜望远镜一周年的声明中，美国宇航局指出，该望远镜“产生了数百篇科学论文，解答了长期存在的问题，并提出了新的问题。”</p>
<p>Eric Smith is a Webb program scientist and associate director for research in the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. He said the Webb's wide abilities to support new science discoveries has already become clear. "Webb's first year of science has not only taught us new things about our universe – but it has revealed the capabilities of the telescope to be greater than our expectations – meaning future discoveries will be even more amazing," Smith said.<br/>
埃里克·史密斯是韦伯望远镜项目科学家，也是美国宇航局华盛顿总部天体物理部的研究副主任。他说，韦伯望远镜支持新科学发现的广泛能力已经变得显而易见。史密斯说：“韦伯望远镜第一年产生的科学不仅教会了我们关于宇宙的新东西，而且揭示了该望远镜的能力比我们的预期更大，这意味着未来的发现将更加惊人。”</p>
<p>NASA has said the Webb has enough fuel to operate for at least 20 years. It will soon be joined in orbit by Europe's Euclid space telescope, which launched on July 1. Euclid's main goal, or mission, is to collect data on two of the universe's greatest mysteries: dark energy and dark matter.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，韦伯望远镜有足够运行至少20年的燃料。7月1日发射的欧洲欧几里得太空望远镜将很快进入轨道与之作伴。欧几里得的主要目标或任务是收集宇宙中暗能量和暗物质这两个最大谜团的相关数据。</p>

            <title>Honduras Plans High Security Prison Build on Unpopulated Caribbean Island  (2023/7/24)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Dominic Varela</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Honduras has announced plans to build a high security prison on an unpopulated island in the Caribbean Sea off the country's eastern coast. The Swan Island project would become the Western Hemisphere's only island prison. Honduran officials say they plan to use the prison to house the country's most violent criminals.</p>
<p>In the past, Honduran President Xiomara Castro promised to solve <strong>gang </strong>violence through reforms to the government and criminal justice systems. Now, she plans to create an island prison capable of holding 2,000 people. The island is over 240 kilometers off the coast.</p>
<p>Island prisons used to be common in Latin America, with owner countries including Brazil, Chile and Colombia. However, riots, poor conditions and prison escapes led to their closing. In 2019, the final island prison closed, a property of Mexico.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Planet Labs PBC shows Islas del Cisne in Honduras, on July 13, 2023.

<p>Officials in Honduras say the new prison will help stop violence. But, critics say island prisons fail to deal with the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Tiziano Breda is a Latin America expert at Italy's Instituto Affari Internazionali. He said that new prisons are "...quite useless if you don't first regain control of the others you already have."</p>
<p>Last month in Honduras, 46 women were killed in a prison fight that involved guns, knives and fire. It was one of the worst incidents in the history of women's prisons.</p>
<p>In answer, President Castro said she would "take <strong>drastic </strong>measures" and put an end to the gangs that have terrorized Honduras for years.</p>
<p><span style="color:black">José Jorge Fortín, the head of Honduras' armed forces, told the Associated Press that the only way to communicate with the island prison is by satellite. He said the government thinks this will make it difficult for gangs inside the prison to organize crime and violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Fortín did not say how much it would cost or how long it will take to build the prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">The neighboring country of El Salvador has already taken a strong position against gangs. One in every 100 people there is a prisoner. The nation's president says gang members represent 30 percent of the prison population in El Salvador. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Rights activists have accused that country's government of abuses in its justice system. But, El Salvador has seen sharp drops in violence and citizens increasingly support the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">"If another country has done something well, why not copy it?" Honduras' Fortín said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">But, </span>Tiziano<span style="color:black"> Breda says this way of thinking moves the country away from changing policies that could make long-term differences.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Honduras's security policy "has become even more reactive and short-sighted, <strong>mimicking</strong> what's going on in El Salvador to contain damage to their public image," Breda said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">However, these ideas are supported by many Hondurans, including scientist Said Santos. He said, "...ending the crime problem once and for all here in Honduras would be <strong>ideal</strong> for this country."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Others are expressing environmental concerns about the new prison plan. Scientists say they worry the project will damage the island's highly <strong>diverse</strong> ecosystem. Last week, the Honduran Biologists Association called the prison a "threat" to nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Lucky Medina is Honduras' secretary of natural resources and the environment. He told the AP that the prison will be built in unity with nature. Officials will follow environmental protection measures, he said. </span></p>

            <title>Native Americans Keep Pipe-Making Tradition Alive  (2023/7/24)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>A tribe of Native Americans in the northern state of Minnesota digs up a special kind of rock and forms it into a device used for smoking, called a pipe.</p>
<p>The dark red rock is known as pipestone because it has been used for a long time to make <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_SwgJCiqs">the</a> smoking tool.</p>
<p><strong>History of pipestone</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Travis Erickson holds a handmade pipe that he carved and crafted from pipestone, which is sold in his shops, on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, in Pipestone, Minn. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/36a494fd-a03f-4608-8d9d-d62f938ffd3a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Travis Erickson holds a handmade pipe that he carved and crafted from pipestone, which is sold in his shops, on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, in Pipestone, Minn. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)</span></div>
<p>The native people consider the rock and pipes <strong>sacred</strong>. But over time, people moved away from the area and others died. As a result, not many people are permitted to dig out the rock and not many others know how to make the pipes.</p>
<p>Only about 12 people remain in the area who know how to carve the pipes. Cindy Pederson is one of them. She learned from her grandparents over 50 years ago. She said she would be happy to teach the pipe-carving skill to anyone. She added, "The Spirit will be with you if you're meant to do that."</p>
<p>Pederson is one of the Dakota people who want to pass along the skill to future generations.</p>
<p>She is part of the <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_A0HJElaR">Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota</a> Nation. She holds classes on pipe-carving at a small <strong>park</strong> near the rock <strong>quarries</strong>. The park in the southwestern part of the state is called Pipestone National Monument.</p>
<p>Darlene St. Clair is a member of the Dakota tribe. She is a professor at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. She also uses the Dakota name lyekiyapiwin to show she is a member of the tribe.</p>
<p>St. Clair said the pipestone is important to the spiritual activities of the Native Americans. "Praying with pipes, we take very seriously," she said.</p>
<p>Smoking a pipe made from the deep red rock is thought to connect the smoker with "the Creator." The creator is similar to what many religions mean when they discuss God.</p>
<p>The smoke moves a prayer from the person with the pipe to the creator.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Drapeau said the pipestone area was always a place for prayer. Even enemy tribes would stop fighting when they arrived at the pipestone area. Tradition has it that if people fought on the ground of the pipestone, the rock would stop being available.</p>
<p>Drapeau is a park <strong>ranger</strong> and cultural resource specialist. She started coming to the rock area as a child. She is part of the Yankton Sioux tribe of South Dakota. When she was young, she heard a story about why the rock turned red. Many people died in a great flood, and their blood changed the color of the rock. The creator then came to the area and said if people smoked from a pipe, they could reach him with a message.</p>
<p>Drapeau said those who smoke the pipes also feel connected to all the people who came before.</p>
<p><strong>Not just any stone</strong></p>
<p>"It's not just a willy-nilly stone," she said. Willy-nilly is a combination of words meant to show that something is unimportant.</p>
<p>Because of that, the rock is protected. If you want to cut the rock from the ground, you need to have permission. Only those who are members of Native American tribes can come to remove the rock.</p>
<p>While some, like Pederson, want to teach pipe-making to others, there is disagreement about whether non-Native Americans should be permitted to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping the knowledge safe</strong></p>
<p>Some think the pipe-making knowledge should only be shared with other Native Americans. In addition, many Native Americans think only Indigenous people should be permitted to use the pipes.</p>
<p>Travis Erickson is one of those people permitted to take the rock from the ground. He started doing that at the age of 10. The diggers must work only with hand tools to protect the pipestone area.</p>
<p>Erickson started making the pipes with his family in the 1960s. He learned with other family members and went on to teach his own children how to do the work. But 60 years later, not many people want to do the difficult job of cutting out the pipestone and making the pipes.</p>
<p>He wants to teach the skills to as many young Native Americans as possible. Many of the young people only learn about the pipestone and the pipes when they come for visits.</p>
<p>Cindy Pederson's brother, Mark, also teaches at the visitor's center. He recently taught a number of young people how to swing heavy <strong>hammers</strong>. Many wanted to return and learn more about cutting out the pipestone.</p>
<p>They also tell the young people the history of the area and its important place in the spiritual life of Native Americans.</p>
<p>Drapeau said she tells them they are permitted to come to pipestone for prayer. In the past, many native people were restricted from coming to pipestone for prayer events.</p>
<p>The Pipestone National Monument is run by the National Park Service, a U.S. government agency. About 75,000 people visit each year.</p>
<p>The government and the native people decided that pipes would no longer be sold in the visitor center. But non-Indigenous people can still buy the pipes just a short distance away at stores in the town of Pipestone.</p>
<p>The native people say they want to protect their traditions. Greg Gagnon studies Native Americans and wrote a book about Dakota culture. He said many native people are worried that their traditions will be <strong>watered down</strong> if they permit everyone to use the pipes.</p>
<p>But Pederson said she is not worried. She said "the spirit" works to help people who create the pipes and receive them.</p>
<p>"Grandma and Grandpa always said the stone takes care of itself, knows what's in a person's heart," she said.</p>

            <title>For Some, Getting Married Needs to Be an Experience Unlike any Other  (2023/7/23)</title>

<p>More <strong>couples</strong> are asking guests to wear nontraditional clothing to their marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>The result appears to be that many guests are not sure what to think about it and are confused by the unusual requests.</p>
<p>Maggie Long is 34 years old and lives in New York. Not too long ago, she attended the wedding of a close friend at a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The couple described the suggested clothing for the event as, "dive bar semiformal." A dive bar is a low cost drinking place where people are not known for good behavior.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Wedding guests who adhered to the dress code of Space Disco Cowboy, pose at a wedding in Austin, Texas on March 30, 2019.

<p>"I love a <strong>theme</strong>," said Long. "It's fun that people aren't taking weddings so seriously, but I had no idea what that meant."</p>
<p>At the dive bar wedding, Long said many older guests got into the idea. One guest wore a rainbow tie-dye shirt, a colorful informal shirt made popular in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Other wedding guests have been invited to weddings that were described as, "tropical formal," "<strong>snappy</strong> casual" and "garden party <strong>whimsical</strong>."</p>
<p>Emily Coyne is the founder of Emily Coyne Events, a wedding design company based in San Francisco, California. She said many couples are trying to make their weddings different from everyone else's wedding.</p>
<p>"The key is making sure there's communication behind the <strong>dress code</strong>. Don't just confuse guests," she said.</p>
<p>When her company designs wedding websites for couples, it includes descriptions for the dress code. The dress code is a description of the kinds of clothes considered right for the event. "Tropical formal," for example, might include long dresses in bright colors and <strong>suits</strong> with unusual ties.</p>
<p>"Most guests have a lot of fun with it," Coyne said.</p>
<p>Rikki Gotthelf attended her friend's "space <strong>disco</strong> cowboy" wedding. The hosts sent their guests to an <strong>abandoned</strong> town near Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>For guidance, Gotthelf looked to Sophie Strauss, who calls herself a "<strong>stylist</strong> for regular people." Strauss suggests asking the couple directly if they had not made themselves clear.</p>
<p>She tells guests dealing with strange dress codes to remember: "It's not a <strong>costume</strong>. Unless, of course, it's <strong>literally</strong> a costume party."</p>
<p>Often, there is some form of personal meaning behind the unusual wedding themes. Thirty-two-year-old Madison Smith is getting married in May 2024. Her dress code calls for "black tie sunset glam."</p>
<p>"It's in honor of my late grandfather," she said. "His favorite thing was the sunsets where I'm getting married." The wedding will be taking place on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.</p>
<p>She hopes for sunset-colored dresses that are orange, yellow, purple, blue or pink. She also wants suits with elements that are of similar, sunset colors.</p>
<p>Jove Meyer is the owner of an event planning company in Brooklyn. He has dealt with dress codes that included "colorful cocktail," and "red carpet ready."</p>
<p>"I always suggest couples <strong>clarify</strong> exactly what they mean," he said.</p>
<p>Brittny Drye is the lead editor of the wedding magazine Love Inc. She said guests should not be unwilling to ask the couple about an unusual dress code.</p>
<p>When couples are asking their guests to wear nontraditional clothes, "they're signing themselves up to be asked questions," Drye said.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about one of those English words that changes meaning depending on the words added to it. "Double" is just such a word.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Identical twins Taiwo Adejare and Kehinde Adejare pose for a picture in Igbo Ora, Oyo State, Nigeria April 4, 2019. Picture taken April 4, 2019. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/B6908C41-A7C2-40C5-B0FC-E778873A89D2_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Identical twins Taiwo Adejare and Kehinde Adejare pose for a picture in Igbo Ora, Oyo State, Nigeria April 4, 2019. Picture taken April 4, 2019. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde</span></div>
<p>It is such a useful word that we should discuss it <u>on the double</u>! That means quickly. If I say, "Get here on the double," it means get here as soon as you can. Please.</p>
<p>But that is just one of the many uses of this <strong>versatile </strong>word.</p>
<p>"Double" means two of something. So, if you <u>double up</u> on something, you increase the amount by two. For example, if I plan to enter a swimming race, I might want to <u>double up</u> on my training. So, if I train one hour a day, I would increase my training to two hours a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you add "down" to "double" you get something completely different. If you <u>double down,</u> you stick to a position or undertaking even if it is not a good one. You are not willing to change your position at all. For example, instead of apologizing for a poorly worded statement, the politician doubled down and said it again. Here, we could also say he <strong><u>dug in</u></strong><u> his heels</u>.</p>
<p>Now, if something does <u>double duty</u> is serves two purposes. For example, an exercise bike serves double duty if I can also dry my towels on it. People can also do double duty. That means they do two jobs or the work of two people.</p>
<p>Let's combine "double" with the word "back." If you <u>double back</u>, you turn around and come back the same way that you came. One time I took a hike and got a little lost. So, instead of continuing, I just doubled back: I returned the way that I came.</p>
<p>A delayed reaction to something that takes you by surprise is called a <u>double take</u>. We usually say <u>do a double take</u>. For example, I did a double take when I saw my co-worker after a year. She had a new haircut and a <strong>tattoo</strong>. I had to <u>double-check</u> if it was even her. When I looked again and made sure it was my friend, I told her how much I liked her tattoo. Then she <u>doubled over</u> with laughter. As it turns out, it was a temporary tattoo. When we <u>double over</u>, we bend over and cannot stand up straight because of laughter or from pain.</p>
<p>For some reason, certain "double" words are not good.</p>
<p>For example, <u>double-crossing</u> someone means to cheat them. A double-cross is a <strong>betrayal</strong>. We could also use the word <u>double-dealing</u> which has a similar meaning.</p>
<p><u>Double talk</u> is language that appears to be meaningful but, in fact, is a mixture of sense and nonsense. And <u>doublespeak</u> is language used to trick people by hiding some of the truth.</p>
<p>A <u>double standard</u> is a set of <strong>principles</strong> or rules that apply differently and usually more severely to one group of people than to another. For example, people are not surprised if an older man dates a much younger woman. However, those same people may criticize a woman who dates a much younger man. That is a common <u>double standard</u> because the outcomes are so different.</p>
<p>And that's the end of <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_4BdUHSsO">this</a> <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. I hope you enjoyed this exploration of the many word combinations using "double." You may want to <u>double up</u> on your English lessons by practicing with the combinations of this very useful word.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>A language <strong>corpus</strong> is a huge collection of texts taken from print, video, audio and other sources. It is a powerful tool that can help you learn more about English words and phrases.</p>
<p>In today's article, we look at the most widely used corpus: the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, or COCA.</p>
<p>COCA contains more than one billion words from 1990-2019. And it has many ways to help learners find out more about how words are used.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Screenshot of Corpus of Contemporary American English, captured on July 20, 2023." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-0fec-08db895b0cf4_cx0_cy0_cw47_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Screenshot of Corpus of Contemporary American English, captured on July 20, 2023.</span></div>
<p>Take the adjective <em>profound</em> as an example.<em> </em>In a dictionary, you will find that one meaning of <em>profound</em> is the adjective <em>deep</em>. So, you might think English speakers will say that a body of water is <em>profound</em>.</p>
<p>But English speakers never say that.</p>
<p>A corpus like COCA shows that the most common words that follow <em>profound </em>are <em>effect </em>or <em>ability. </em>And the most common words that follow the adjective <em>deep</em> are <em>breath</em> or <em>water</em>. For example, we will say:</p>
<p><em>Her teaching has a <u>profound effect</u> on students' learning.</em></p>
<p><em>You need to be a strong swimmer to swim in <u>deep water</u>.</em></p>
<p>COCA makes it easy to read and hear examples of how to use vocabulary correctly.</p>
<p><strong>How to use COCA</strong></p>
<p>First, you will need to register with COCA to use the collection. You can register for two kinds of accounts. A free account limits you to 20 searches for words within any 24-hour period. A paid account will give you 200 searches within any 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Here are the steps for using COCA to find examples of how a word is used. We will use the word <em>profound </em>to show this.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:8px">On the home page, type the word <em>profound</em> in the white search box on the left side of the screen.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Click "find matching strings" just below the search box. This will take you to a new webpage.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">On this new page, you will see the word <em>profound </em>in blue. Click on it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:8px">You will now see a page with 100 examples using the word <em>profound</em>, and the word <em>profound </em>is shown in green. The source of each example is shown on the left side.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">If you click on the source on the left, COCA will show you a larger part of the text containing the example.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px">If you want to see more examples, click the two forward page arrows &gt;&gt; at the top or bottom left. This brings you to the next 100 examples. In this way, you might find more kinds of sources for the examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>COCA also has a tool that lets you see many useful things about a word on one page. We will show this with the word <em>deep.</em></p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:8px">On the COCA homepage, click on "Word" in blue just above the white search box.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Type the word <em>deep</em> in the search box.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Click on the "See detailed info for the word" just below the search box.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Now you will see a page with definitions, audio <strong>pronunciation</strong>, links to <strong>translations</strong>, <strong>synonyms</strong>, links to videos with the word, and more. This page is called the "Word homepage".</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px">Scroll down the page. You will see another long list of example sentences, with words in many colors. The adjective <em>deep</em> is in green and the nouns that follow it are in blue.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see that in these examples, the noun <em>breath</em> occurs the most after the adjective <em>deep</em>.</p>
<p>You may wonder, how can we know for sure that the most common words that follow <em>deep </em>are <em>breath </em>or <em>water? </em></p>
<p>Scroll back to the top of the "Word homepage" for <em>deep</em>. On the right, you will see the word COLLOCATES in blue. (A collocation is a word or phrase that is often used with another word or phrase.) Clicking on COLLOCATES will show you lists of words that follow <em>deep. </em>And you will see that <em>breath</em> and w<em>ater </em>are the first two words on the list.</p>
<p><strong>Why the corpus is helpful</strong></p>
<p>Knowing what words sound the best together can be hard for people learning English. A corpus can be helpful because it shows you ways that words are used together.</p>
<p>See if you can learn to use COCA by searching for the adjectives <em>utter </em>and <em>diverse</em>. <em>Utter </em>is both a verb and an adjective, so you must tell COCA to only search for adjectives. Here is how to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Just to the right of the white search box, click on the [POS] letters in grey.</li>
<li style="margin-left:8px">Next, click on POS again and then select "adj. ALL". This makes COCA search only for adjectives.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px">In the search box, delete the letters ADJ and type the word you want to search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now follow the steps shown above for <em>profound </em>and <em>deep</em>, but this time, use the words <em>utter</em> and <em>diverse.</em></p>
<p>If you find on the "Word homepage" for <em>utter </em>that COCA has searched for the verb form, you can change it to adjective. To do this, click on ADJ in blue just below the word <em>utter </em>on the top left area of the page.</p>
<p>When you perform a search, what do you notice about the nouns that follow <em>utter? </em> About the nouns that follow <em>diverse?</em></p>
<p>Write to us and let us know what you found.</p>
<p>Learning how to use a corpus can take some time. COCA has a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/help/coca2020_overview.pdf">guide</a> showing you the many ways to use it. You can also find <strong>tutorials</strong> on YouTube.</p>
<p>Just remember that a corpus is a tool that can help you deepen your understanding of vocabulary and the ways to use it.</p>
<p>And in another Education Tips, we will explain more about the importance of collocations and how a corpus can help you learn them.</p>

            <title>Actors and Writers in US Begin Second Week of Joint Strike  (2023/7/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Dominic Varela</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 July 2023</span><br/>
<p class="paragraph">A combined strike by Hollywood actors and screenwriters is entering its second week with no sign of an end to the labor action.</p>
<p class="paragraph">For a week, actors including Tina Fey, Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosario Dawson, David Duchovny and other stars have joined working class performers and writers on<strong> picket</strong> lines. They are protesting outside studios and corporate offices of <strong>streaming</strong> companies Amazon, MAX and Netflix.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The famous actors' appearance on picket lines has provided additional star power and<strong> </strong>voices on issues central to both groups — better pay and protection from the use of artificial intelligence. About 65,000 actors — the large majority of whom do not make enough from acting to qualify for health care <strong>benefits</strong> through their union — along with 11,500 screenwriters, are on strike.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Actors Aubrey Plaza, left, and Hannah Einbinder, right, picket outside Netflix studios on July 20, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.

<p class="paragraph"> </p>
<p class="paragraph">While many of the picket lines are in Los Angeles and New York, film and television production happens throughout the country. Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois were among the major cities with strike events Tuesday and Wednesday. Later Friday, actors in Britain's capital, London, held an event in solidarity with the American workers.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers represents the studios and streaming companies. The group has said it offered both writers and actors substantial pay increases and have tried to meet other demands.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Many on the picket lines have seized upon comments by their corporate bosses like Disney CEO Bob Iger, who last week called the workers' demands "not realistic."</p>
<p class="paragraph">During an earnings event Wednesday, Netflix co-leader Ted Sarandos said he grew up in a union household and knows how difficult strikes are for workers.</p>
<p class="paragraph">"We're super <strong>committed</strong> to getting to an agreement as soon as possible. One that's <strong>equitable</strong> and one that enables the unions, the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future," he said.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> </p>
<p class="paragraph">Actor-writer Seth Green said streaming, which became a main media supplier during the pandemic, has hurt the livelihoods of those striking.</p>
<p class="paragraph">"It all got broken. I mean, it sounds silly to say, but it's really as simple as that," Green said, speaking outside Paramount Studios in Hollywood Thursday. Traditional entertainment contracts used to pay actors and writers throughout the long lifespan of successful shows and movies. But no longer, he said.</p>
<p class="paragraph">"If the company that owned the thing made a billion dollars, you'd get like a little bit of money from that."</p>
<p class="paragraph">"All of that," Green said, "is gone."</p>

            <title>Barbenheimer: Two Movies, One Day  (2023/7/22)</title>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Two of the biggest summer movies are being released on the same day, July 21<sup>st</sup>, <em>Barbie</em> directed by Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan's <em>Oppenheimer</em>.</p>
<p>The release of the movies has gotten a lot of attention on the internet and in social media. Many people are buying tickets to watch both films on the same day, creating the <strong>double feature</strong> event called "Barbenheimer."</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="BARBENHEIMER" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/0ca68c55-e942-4c26-ab57-d999520c59ea_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">BARBENHEIMER</span></div>
<p>The word "Barbenheimer" is a portmanteau or blend word of, not only the letters of the words, but their meanings as well. There is even some disagreement about how the word should be spelled: "Barbieheimer" or "Barbenheimer" or even "Boppenheimer."</p>
<p>Studios often target films in different <strong>genres</strong> for release on the same weekend. <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a serious <strong>drama</strong> about the man who supervised the development of the atomic bomb. <em>Barbie</em> is a colorful film about a popular line of American toys played by real people.</p>
<p>Directors Gerwig and Nolan have <strong>enthusiastic</strong> fans online. Some people are fans of both. When a new advertisement is shown for one movie, both show a lot of social media interactions.<strong> </strong>There are even <strong>memes</strong> and tee-shirts made about the release of the two movies on the same day.</p>
<p>Paul Dergarabedian is a media expert. He said that the "Barbenheimer" marketing is good for both movies.</p>
<p>"You're certainly aware of both movies in a more <strong>profound</strong> and <strong>compelling</strong> way," Dergarabedian said of the two movies.</p>
<p>Many theaters have already reported tickets sale for the double feature. AMC Theaters reported that 20,000 AMC Stubs members have bought tickets for both movies. That is over four hours of movie-watching.</p>
<p><strong>Barbenheimer days</strong></p>
<p>The stars say they are planning "Barbenheimer" days.</p>
<p>Margot Robbie plays Barbie. She spoke at the movie's first showing in London. She said people should start and end their day with Barbie, watching Oppenheimer in the middle. "It's a perfect <strong>double bill</strong>. "I think actually start your day with 'Barbie,' then go <span style="color:black">straight into <em>Oppenheimer</em> and then a <em>Barbie</em>..." The movie's star said people should watch her film twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Actor Tom Cruise's movie <em>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One</em> was released just one week before "Barbenheimer." He said that he plans to see both films on opening day, probably starting with <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </span></p>
<p>Issa Rae is one of the actresses in <em>Barbie</em>. At the London premiere, she said there is a reason for people wanting to end their day with <em>Barbie</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:black">"I think that there's a very specific order that (you should) see them in," Rae said. </span></p>
<p>Some people in Hollywood think that the July 21<sup>st</sup> date for the opening of both films is not by chance. Many wonder if Warner Bros. Studios wanted <em>Barbie</em> to open the same weekend as <em>Oppenheimer</em> because Nolan had opened other films like <em>Inception</em> and <em>Dunkirk</em> through Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Nolan left the studio because of a decision to send a year's worth of movies to <strong>streaming</strong> <strong>services</strong>. Nolan then made <em>Oppenheimer </em>with Universal Studios.</p>
<p><strong>Unspoken rule</strong></p>
<p>There is an unspoken rule in Hollywood: Never publicly say bad things about another studio's movie. This idea is connected to a belief that supporting one movie is good for other movies. If a person goes to one movie and sees advertisements for another, it might create more interest and help the whole industry.</p>
<p>Cruise knew that that his <em>Mission: Impossible</em> would no longer be shown on the huge IMAX screens at some theaters when <em>Oppenheimer</em> is released. But Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christophere McQuarrie in front of advertisements for competing movies <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>, <em>Barbie</em>, and <em>Oppenheimer</em>.</p>
<p>Cruise posted the photos on his social media account saying: "This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can't wait to see on the big screen."</p>
<p>Dergarabedian said, "Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest <strong>box office</strong> star in the world, but he's also an incredible ambassador<strong> </strong>for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and <strong>boosting</strong> other movies."</p>
<p>He added that the friendly environment created by competition in Hollywood was a good thing.</p>
<p>The actors, directors and official social media accounts of all the movies have been very supportive of one another. Cillian Murphy plays Robert Oppenheimer. He told the Associated Press at the movie's London showing that, "of course" he would watch <em>Barbie</em>.</p>
<p>But everyone still enjoys a number one <strong>debut</strong>. Both <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em> reportedly cost $100 million to make, not including millions of dollars spent on marketing.</p>
<p>The <em>Barbie</em> opening weekend could make over $90 million in North America only, while <em>Oppenheimer</em> is expected to make $40 million on its first weekend. But <em>Oppenheimer</em> may have a longer life into awards season.</p>
<p>There is a lot of pressure on "Barbenheimer" to increase <strong>revenues </strong>for underperforming summer movies. <span style="color:black">And other issues like the </span><a class="wsw__a" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/hollywood-writers-expected-to-settle-in-for-long-strike/7079918.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:inherit">writers' strike</span></a><span style="color:black"><span style="color:inherit">, which actors recently joined, are on people's minds. For example, the actors of <em>Oppenheimer</em> walked out of their movie's first showing in London as the actors' strike was announced.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi there. This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "snug," "cozy," and "comfortable."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">Dear teacher,</span></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Snug, Cozy and Comfortable " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-7993-08db89686325_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Snug, Cozy and Comfortable </span></div>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">I am Zalat from Egypt. I hope you are well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">I would like to know the difference between these words, "snug," "cozy" and "comfortable." </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">Thanks a lot,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">Zalat</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing to us, Zalat. All three words can mean the same thing, to describe feeling <strong>relaxed</strong>. But there are many small differences, and we can use them in different situations.</p>
<p>Let's start with "comfortable."</p>
<p><strong>Comfortable</strong></p>
<p>"Comfortable" is an adjective. If we are talking about clothes or household goods like blankets or bedding, we can call them "comfortable" if they give relaxation or physical ease.</p>
<p>My new bed is so comfortable that I fall asleep right away.</p>
<p>I love coming home and putting on a pair of comfortable pants.</p>
<p>We can extend the meaning of physical ease and relaxation to other areas of our lives.</p>
<p>"Comfortable" can mean freedom from <strong>stress</strong> or worry.</p>
<p>She lives a comfortable life out in the country away from the stress of the city.</p>
<p>The word can also mean being free of pain.</p>
<p>The nurse asked the patient if she was comfortable after the <strong>surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>It can mean having financial security.</p>
<p>Zeke has a comfortable <strong>income</strong> now that he started his new job.</p>
<p>We also have a short form of "comfortable" and that is adjective "comfy."</p>
<p>She loves to get comfy on the couch and watch her favorite TV shows.</p>
<p>Let's move onto "cozy."</p>
<p><strong>Cozy</strong></p>
<p>"Cozy" is an adjective and overlaps in meaning with "comfortable."</p>
<p>Something that is "cozy" gives a feeling of comfort, relaxation or closeness.</p>
<p>We are going to a cozy <strong>cottage</strong> in Maine for our vacation.</p>
<p>We had a cozy chat at the coffee shop.</p>
<p>"Cozy up to" can mean to get closer to something in order to get more comfortable, especially in cold weather.</p>
<p>I love to cozy up to the fireplace with a good book.</p>
<p>And lastly, "cozy" has a special meaning as a noun in American English. It means a covering<strong> </strong>to keep drinks warm or cold, especially if they are in cans or bottles.</p>
<p>She keeps a variety of cozies in her kitchen for her guests' drinks.</p>
<p>Let's move onto "snug."</p>
<p><strong>Snug</strong></p>
<p>There is a saying that we use often with the word, "as snug as a bug in a rug."</p>
<p>This saying describes the meaning of "snug" very nicely. "Snug" as an adjective has a meaning that combines "comfortable" and "cozy" into one. It can describe a feeling of <strong>contentment</strong>, warmth and protection.</p>
<p>If you feel as snug as a bug in a rug, you feel warm, safe and comfortable.</p>
<p>"Snug" also means fitting closely together.</p>
<p>The <strong>tent</strong> at our campsite was snug up against the tree in the rain.</p>
<p>Clothing can be snug, meaning it fits close to the body.</p>
<p>Shoes should not fit too snug on the feet.</p>
<p>And finally, as a verb, "snug" means to cause to fit closely or to make snug. We get another verb "snuggle" from "snug." We use "snuggle" more often. It means to draw physically near for comfort</p>
<p>My cat loves snuggling up to me in the winter, so he stays warm.</p>

            <title>In Vietnam, US Treasury Chief Seeks Stronger Economic and Security Ties  (2023/7/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. will seek to develop stronger economic and security ties with Vietnam.</p>
<p>Yellen held talks with Vietnamese officials Thursday in Hanoi. Her trip to the Southeast Asian nation came after visits to India and China. In India, Yellen attended financial ministers' meetings of the Group of 20 major industrial economies.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said Yellen met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. During the talks, Yellen told the Vietnamese leader, "The U.S. considers Vietnam a key partner in <strong>advancing</strong> a free and open Indo-Pacific," U.S. officials said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sits on a scooter while visiting a factory assembling electric scooters in Hanoi, Vietnam on Thursday, July 20, 2023.

<p>Yellen's visit came as the U.S. continues diplomacy efforts that aim to build stronger ties with other countries in the Indo-Pacific area as China's influence grows among its neighbors.</p>
<p>"Vietnam is also a close economic partner, with our two-way trade reaching record highs last year and the United States serving as Vietnam's largest export market," Yellen said. "It is a <strong>priority</strong> for our administration to deepen our economic and security ties with Vietnam."</p>
<p>Yellen visited an electric <strong>scooter</strong> factory and briefly sat on a new model produced by Selex Motors, a five-year-old Vietnamese company.</p>
<p>Yellen said the U.S. is prepared to provide $15 billion to support <strong>renewable</strong> energy efforts in Vietnam as part of the Just Energy Transition Partnership. This was a promise made by the Group of Seven economies to help Vietnam reduce its dependency on oil and gas. The countries have offered similar assistance to South Africa and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier to a group of businesswomen and economists, Yellen praised growing investments in Vietnamese industries including computer <strong>chips</strong> and renewable energy.</p>
<p>Yellen's visit is seen as part of new U.S. efforts to balance China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific area. Earlier this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Vietnam weeks after the 50th anniversary of the U.S. troop withdrawal that ended America's direct military involvement in Vietnam. Blinken promised to increase relations to new levels.</p>
<p>Yellen also met with the governor of Vietnam's central bank, Nguyen Thi Hong. The secretary announced new economic policy talks between the State Bank of Vietnam and the U.S. Treasury Department.</p>
<p>Yellen thanked Nguyen for "close cooperation" between the U.S. and the State Bank of Vietnam on looking at American concerns over Vietnam's currency policies. She added that the U.S. would remain supportive of Vietnam's growth and that close economic ties would help both the Vietnamese and American people.</p>
<p>Vietnam has quickly become an important center for big international manufacturers. These include operations in Vietnam for South Korea's LG and Samsung Electronics, suppliers to Apple, and automakers like Honda and Toyota.</p>

            <title>After 50 Years, Officials Aim to Remove an Israeli Man from His Beach Home  (2023/7/21)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>For more than 50 years, Nissim Kahlon has lived in an unusual way on the Mediterranean coast in Israel.</p>
<p>He started by setting up a tent on the <strong>beach</strong> in Herzliya, not far from the city of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Over time, he started making a cave in the stone <strong>cliffs</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nissim Kahlon's home, chiseled out of the sandstone cliffs, overlooks the Mediterranean sea in Herzliya, Israel, Wednesday, June 28, 2023. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/ed87f4b0-ec60-4c21-b42e-bb4acc29f182_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Nissim Kahlon's home, chiseled out of the sandstone cliffs, overlooks the Mediterranean sea in Herzliya, Israel, Wednesday, June 28, 2023. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)</span></div>
<p>Little by little, he made a living space. He started to make stairs and windows. He built up the stone walls with glass and colorful <strong>tiles</strong> he found while walking in the city.</p>
<p>Now, his home is a <strong>tourist attraction</strong>. People come to the beach just to see what he has made.</p>
<p>But officials in Israel want the 77-year-old to leave.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Ministry said Kahlon's cave home is illegal. The ministry says the cave home makes the traditional homes above his unsafe. They worry the cave damaged the structure of the cliff.</p>
<p>Officials sent Kahlon a letter telling him to leave, known as an <strong>eviction</strong> notice.</p>
<p>"Instead of <strong>encouraging</strong> me, they're <strong>denigrating</strong> me," Kahlon said.</p>
<p>He said his home is safe. It even has electricity, a telephone and a toilet.</p>
<p>He said his home is an example of living without waste. Everything he cuts out of the stone he uses. "There's no waste here, that's the <strong>logic</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>The last time the government told him to leave was in 1974. He received a document that said his home would be torn down. But it never happened. He did not hear of any government concerns for almost 50 years.</p>
<p>The removal order has been suspended while Kahlon appeals the decision. Kahlon plans to say the government knew about him for many years. He said the city approved his presence when it connected his home to electric power.</p>
<p>He said he wants to die in the home he built for himself.</p>
<p>"I am ready for them to bury me here," he said.</p>
<p>The government said Kahlon's home makes the cliff unsteady. Officials are worried about the homes at the top of the cliff. But the government is concerned about more than that.</p>
<p>An old weapons production center is only about 400 meters north of Kahlon's home. The production center closed 30 years ago after an accidental explosion killed two workers, damaged hundreds of buildings and broke windows far away. The government worries there are still some explosive devices nearby. In June, an explosion blew a large hole in the sand not far from Kahlon's cave.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense said there are not supposed to be any explosives in the area. However, no government or private organization has cleaned the area and checked it for explosives since the weapons center closed in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Some say the Israeli government is using its concerns about unexploded weapons and the cliff wall to push Kahlon out of his home. The local leaders in Herzliya said they have a new place for Kahlon to live. But Kahlon said he wants to stay. His friends are raising money for his appeal.</p>
<p>After speaking to the Associated Press, he picked up some tools and started working on his home.</p>
<p>"I'm doing something to feel something," he said. "I can't sit around all day."</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 July 2023</span><br/>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we finish our discussion of the 2019 song, <em>Looking for America,</em> by singer Lana Del Rey. By making a close reading of the song's words, we will understand more about its sounds and structure. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#222f3a">What is a close reading? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">A close reading is a deep reading of a story. Works of literature such as poems are often the object of close readings. These can include the words to songs. The aim is to understand the writer's <strong>intentions</strong> by looking closely at the details. Last time, we considered the grammar and cultural elements of the song. This time we will talk about the poetic devices and the <strong>syllable</strong> structure of a few lines. </span></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Close Reading of " america="" for="" looking="" part="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-b9b5-08db87c95234_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A Close Reading of "Looking for America," Part 2 </span></div>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">Del Rey uses many poetic devices to strengthen what may be thought of as a simple song. Let's take a look. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#222f3a">Rhymes and alliteration </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#222f3a">Rhymes</span></strong><span style="color:#222f3a"> are made with </span><span style="color:#222f3a">two or more words that end in the same sound. Lines two and four share a similar <strong>vowel</strong> sound, /ai/, with the words "line" and "time." Although they do not end in the same <strong>consonant</strong> sound, they still rhyme. This rhyming of similar vowel sounds is called assonance. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">Missed that Hudson River line...</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">That's another place and time...</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">We see in lines five and six two other rhymes created by using the vowel sound /u/ with the words "blues" and "do." </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">So many things that I think twice about before I do...</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">Lastly, in lines eight, nine and ten, Del Rey uses other poetic devices.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly</span></em><span style="color:#222f3a"> </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide</span></em><span style="color:#222f3a"> </span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#222f3a">It's just a dream I had in mind</span></em><span style="color:#222f3a"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">In line 8, we see another form of rhyme with the words "one" and "gun." This is <strong>internal</strong> rhyme. It is when a writer includes rhyming words within the same line, rather than at the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">We also see in line 8 repeating "f" sounds with the words "...flag can freely fly." This is an example of alliteration, <strong>repetition</strong> of the first consonant sounds in words that are close together. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">In line 9, we have more assonance with the /ai/ vowel with the words "sky," "fireworks," and "collide." In all three lines, the repetition of the /ai/ vowel is seen throughout with "fly," "collide," and "mind," <strong>mirroring</strong> the sounds in the beginning with "line" and "time."</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#222f3a">Final Thoughts</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#222f3a">In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we found more details in Lana Del Rey's song Looking for America. We considered syllable structure and learned about several poetic devices such as assonance, internal rhyme and alliteration. </span></p>

            <title>US Announces Program to Identify Safe Smart Devices  (2023/7/20)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">19 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has announced a new program to identify smart devices that are better equipped to resist internet attacks.</p>
<p>The effort is designed to help the public decide which devices in the marketplace carry the best protection against possible <strong>cyberattacks</strong>.</p>
<p>The program will issue a "U.S. Cyber Trust Mark" to the most protected devices, the administration <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/18/biden-harris-administration-announces-cybersecurity-labeling-program-for-smart-devices-to-protect-american-consumers/">said</a> in a statement Tuesday. The effort will be carried out by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="3D printed models of people working on computers and padlock are seen in front of a displayed CYBER ATTACK and binary code in this picture illustration taken, February 1, 2022.

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)</span></div>
<p>"The goal of the program is to provide tools for <strong>consumers</strong> to make informed decisions about the relative security of products they choose to bring into their homes," the statement added.</p>
<p>FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel explained the program would cover a wide range of smart devices including climate control systems, televisions, microwaves and fitness <strong>trackers</strong>. Such devices are part of the "internet of things," which officials warn could present increased cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Several manufacturers have voluntarily agreed "to increase cybersecurity for the products they sell," the Biden administration said. These companies include Amazon, Best Buy, Google, LG Electronics USA, Logitech and Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p>The FCC is expected to seek public comment on the program before giving its final approval and officially launching it. Officials said the public should start seeing product identifications, or labels, sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>The safety level of products is to be rated by quality requirements, or standards, created by the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>. These guidelines call for products to require <strong>unique</strong> and strong passwords, data protection measures and software improvements. In addition, the devices should have built-in tools to identify when cyberattacks are attempted.</p>
<p>The effort will be similar to the Energy Star program, which currently labels products to show that they save energy. Labeled devices would also include <strong>QR codes </strong>to provide additional information to consumers. Officials said the products will be reexamined yearly to make sure they meet requirements.</p>
<p>In March, the Biden administration launched a national cyber campaign. The campaign called on software manufacturers and companies to increase efforts to protect their products against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The increase of smart devices on the market has happened as the number of cybercrimes has increased. Internet attacks on personal devices can give criminals a way into home computer networks.</p>
<p>The amount of dangerous software aimed at internet-of-things devices rose sharply in 2022, cybersecurity company SonicWall has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sonicwall.com/2023-cyber-threat-report/">estimated</a>. Many of the attacks happened in North America.</p>
<p>The FCC's Rosenworcel said consumers can now "have peace of mind that the products that they're bringing into their homes <strong>adhere</strong> to widely accepted security and privacy standards."</p>
<p>An April report from cybersecurity company Bitdefender estimated the least secure devices were smart televisions, followed by smart <strong>plugs</strong>, <strong>routers</strong> and digital video recorders.</p>
<p>Internationally, the U.S. Department of State will seek to persuade allies and partners to cooperate to establish similar labeling efforts, the White House statement said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>U.S. officials on Monday approved the first long-acting drug to protect babies and young children against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.<br/>
美国官员周一批准了第一种防止婴幼儿感染呼吸道合胞病毒的长效药物。</p>
<p>RSV sends tens of thousands of American children to the hospital each year. The virus is a cold-like disease for most healthy people. But it can be life-threatening in the very young and very old. Last year, a large increase in RSV cases crowded U.S. hospitals with sick children.<br/>
呼吸道合胞病毒每年导致数以万计的美国儿童前往医院。对大多数健康的人士来说，这种病毒是一种类似感冒的疾病。但它可能会危及老少的生命。去年，呼吸道合胞病毒病例的大幅增长使美国医院挤满了患病儿童。</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the injection for infants and children up to 2 years old who face increased risk of severe RSV.<br/>
美国食品药品监督管理局批准为面临严重呼吸道合胞病毒风险加大的婴儿和2岁以下儿童注射该疫苗。</p>
<p>The approval helps "reduce the impact of RSV disease on children, families and the health care system" said FDA's Dr. John Farley in a statement.<br/>
美国食品药品监督管理局的约翰·法利博士在一份声明中表示，这次批准有助于“减轻呼吸道合胞病毒疾病对儿童、家庭和医疗保健系统的影响”。</p>
<p>The drugmaker AstraZeneca developed the drug. It will be sold under the name Beyfortus. It is a laboratory-made version of an antibody that helps the immune system fight off RSV.<br/>
制药商阿斯利康开发了这种药物。它将以Beyfortus的名字出售。这是一种实验室制造的抗体，它有助于免疫系统对抗呼吸道合胞病毒。</p>
<p>Under the FDA approval, babies — including small infants — can receive a single injection to protect against their first season of RSV, which usually lasts about five months. Children up to age 2 can receive another dose to protect them during their second season facing the virus.<br/>
根据美国食品药品监督管理局的批准，包括新生儿在内的婴儿可以接受一次注射，以预防他们在第一个呼吸道合胞病毒流行季感染，这个时期通常会持续大约五个月。2岁以下儿童可以在面临病毒感染的第二个流行季再接种一剂以保护他们。</p>
<p>Beyfortus is already approved in Canada, Europe and Britain. It did not immediately announce the U.S. price of the treatment.<br/>
Beyfortus已经在加拿大、欧洲和英国获得批准。它没有立即宣布美国的治疗价格。</p>
<p>FDA officials approved the drug based on three studies. They showed Beyfortus reduced the risk of RSV infection between 70 percent and 75 percent among infants and children 2 and younger.<br/>
美国食品药品监督管理局官员根据三项研究批准了该药物。这些研究表明，Beyfortus将婴儿和2岁及以下儿童感染呼吸道合胞病毒的风险降低了70%至75%。</p>
<p>Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet early next month to recommend exactly who should get the drug.<br/>
美国疾病控制与预防中心的顾问将于下月初开会，就该药物的适用人群提出确切建议。</p>
<p>A similar antibody drug won FDA approval more than 20 years ago. But the drug is only recommended for high-risk babies and requires monthly injections. Doctors say that drug is underused. But they expect the longer-lasting effect of AstraZeneca's shot to be more popular.<br/>
20多年前，一种类似的抗体药物获得了美国食品药品监督管理局的批准。但这种药物只推荐给高危婴儿，并且需要每月注射一次。医生说这种药未充分利用。但他们预计阿斯利康的长效疫苗会更受欢迎。</p>
<p>In the U.S., about 58,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized for RSV each year. Several hundred die.<br/>
在美国，每年约有5.8万名5岁以下的儿童因呼吸道合胞病毒住院。有几百人死亡。</p>
<p>After years of setbacks for RSV research, drugmakers have made big improvements this year. In May, the FDA approved two RSV vaccines for older adults from GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.<br/>
在呼吸道合胞病毒研究经历了多年的挫折之后，制药商今年取得了重大进展。今年5月，美国食品药品监督管理局批准了来自葛兰素史克和辉瑞公司的两种针对老年人的呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗。</p>
<p>In August, the FDA is expected to make a decision on approving Pfizer's vaccine for pregnant women. The aim is for the vaccine to pass along protection to their newborns.<br/>
预计美国食品药品监督管理局将于8月就批准辉瑞公司的疫苗用于孕妇做出决定。其目的是让疫苗为新生儿提供保护。</p>

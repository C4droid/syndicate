        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a law that bans children in the state under the age of 14 from having a social media account.</p>
<p>The measure requires parental permission before 14 and 15 year olds can sign up for personal social media accounts in Florida.</p>
<p>Supporters say the bill protects children from possible online harm, including threats to mental health and privacy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Social media apps are seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

<p>Critics have said the law might violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection of free speech. Some opponents have said they think parents – not the government – should be the ones to decide which restrictions are best for their child. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, opposed the legislation for example.</p>
<p>Florida's legislature passed the law earlier this month. It was the second version of the measure. The first version, which passed Florida's legislature in February, would have completely banned children under age 16 from social media.</p>
<p>DeSantis vetoed that version of the bill, saying he thought it was too restrictive of parental rights. But the governor's office worked with legislators to come up with a new measure he could support. The new law leaves it up to parents to decide whether their 16 and 17 year olds can sign up for social media accounts.</p>
<p>In a statement, DeSantis said research had repeatedly shown that social media services can harm children in several major ways. The legislation, he added, is designed to give parents "a greater ability to protect their children."</p>
<p>The law is set to take effect on January 1, 2025. But experts say the measure is likely to face legal <strong>challenges</strong> in court.</p>
<p>DeSantis noted that another bill he signed into law two years ago was recently struck down by a federal appeals court. That law banned employers from requiring training sessions that included discussions about race, diversity and other issues. The appeals court ruled that such training methods violated the constitutional free speech rights of employers.</p>
<p>The new law was guided through Florida's House of Representatives by Republican Speaker Paul Renner. At a bill-signing ceremony at a school, Renner said a child, whose brain is still developing, "doesn't have the ability to know that they're being <strong>sucked into</strong> these <strong>addictive</strong> technologies." He added, "Because of that, we have to step in for them."</p>
<p>The bill does not name any specific social media service. But it states that it targets social media sites using tools to get users to stay online for long periods. The measure does not cover services that mainly provide email, messaging or texting services.</p>
<p>The law requires social media companies to permanently remove personal information collected from closed accounts. And it lets parents bring civil lawsuits against services failing to do so.</p>
<p>Several U.S. states have considered similar legislation. In March 2023, Utah became the first to enact laws covering children's use of social media. Measures in Arkansas, Louisiana, Ohio and Texas soon followed. Several other states are also developing new rules.</p>
<p>The Arkansas law required parental <strong>consent</strong> for minors to create new social media accounts. A federal judge blocked the law in August. The judge ruled the legislation was likely unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Florida has enacted additional measures aimed at protecting children from possible technological harms. Last year, it became the first state to strongly <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-educators-increasingly-urge-total-phone-bans-in-schools/7508214.html">restrict phones in schools</a>. The law requires all public schools in Florida to ban student cellphone use and block social media services during class.</p>

            <title>How to Find AI ‘Deepfake’ Images  (2024/3/28)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 March 2024</span><br/>
<p><strong>Fake</strong> photos, videos, and audio are spreading online as a result of the rise and misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. And it is getting harder to tell what is real from what is not.</p>
<p>Video and image creators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and OpenAI's Sora make it easy for people with little technical skills to create "deepfakes."</p>
<p>The fake images might seem harmless. But they can be used to cheat people out of money, steal identities, spread propaganda, and unfairly influence elections.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The following photo-illustrated graphic highlights a few notable areas of an AI-deepfake of Pope Francis. (AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/dd6f5ed5-c5ce-43f3-ab0a-c347849f021c_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The following photo-illustrated graphic highlights a few notable areas of an AI-deepfake of Pope Francis. (AP)</span></div>
<p><strong>How to tell it is a deepfake</strong></p>
<p>Just a year ago, the technology was far from perfect and it was easier to tell that a photo had been created with AI. Fake images then showed clear errors, like hands with six fingers or eyeglasses with different shapes.</p>
<p>But as AI has improved, it has become a lot harder.</p>
<p>Henry Ajder is founder of the AI advising company Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in <strong>generative</strong> AI. He said some widely shared advice — like looking for unnatural eye movements in people in deepfake videos <i></i>173;— no longer holds.</p>
<p>Still, there are some things to look for, he said.</p>
<p>Ajder said a lot of AI deepfake photos, especially of people, have a "smoothing effect" that leaves skin looking very "<strong>polished</strong>." He warned, however, that AI can sometimes change the photos and remove the signs of AI creation.</p>
<p>Look at <strong>shadows</strong> and lighting. Often the subject is clear and appears lifelike, but elements in the rest of the photo might not seem so real or polished.</p>
<p><strong>Look at the faces</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common deepfakes is exchanging one face for another. The practice is called face-swapping.</p>
<p>Experts advise looking closely at the edges of the face. Does the facial skin color match the rest of the head or body? Are the edges of the face sharp or unclear?</p>
<p>If you suspect video of a person speaking has been changed by AI, look at their mouth. Do their <strong>lip </strong>movements line up with the audio perfectly?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity company Norton says that the technology is not ready to create individual teeth. So Ajder suggests looking at their teeth. Are they clear, or are they unclear and somehow do not appear like they would in real life?</p>
<p>Sometimes the <strong>context</strong> of the photo is important. Take a minute to consider if what you are seeing could actually happen.</p>
<p>The Poynter journalism website advises that if you see a well-known person do something that seems unrealistic or unlike themselves, it could be a deepfake.</p>
<p><strong>Using AI to find the fakes</strong></p>
<p>Another method is to use AI to fight AI.</p>
<p>Microsoft has developed a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/01/disinformation-deepfakes-newsguard-video-authenticator/">tool</a> that can study photos or videos and rate if it has been changed. Technology company Intel's FakeCatcher uses <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/blogs/trusted-media.html">computer programs</a> to study the smallest parts of an image, called pixels, to say if it is real or fake.</p>
<p>However, some of these tools are not available to the public. That is because researchers do not want to help bad actors improve their deepfakes.</p>
<p>All this being said, AI has been developing very quickly. And AI models are being trained on internet data to produce increasingly better content with fewer mistakes.</p>
<p>That means this advice to find deepfakes could be incorrect even a year from now.</p>
<p>Experts say it might even be dangerous to suggest the average person can find deepfakes. That is because even for trained eyes, it is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>Coffee growers in many countries are worried about a new European rule designed to prevent deforestation.</p>
<p>Deforestation describes when developers cut down trees to make room for crops, buildings or land where cattle can <strong>graze</strong>.</p>
<p>The new rule goes into effect at the end of 2024. It covers products like coffee, cocoa, soy, palm oil, wood, rubber and beef. The European Union says all of those products result in tree cutting. The United Nations says deforestation is the world's second-leading cause of carbon <strong>emissions</strong> after the burning of <strong>fossil fuels</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Farmer Le Van Tam tends coffee plants at a coffee farm in Dak Lak province, Vietnam on Feb. 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Hau Dinh)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/6cd8972e-e0f1-48fb-8aa8-5eb0e303aac9_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Farmer Le Van Tam tends coffee plants at a coffee farm in Dak Lak province, Vietnam on Feb. 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Hau Dinh)</span></div>
<p>Large producers must show their products come from land where trees have not been cut down since 2020. Smaller producers must do the same but will be permitted to sell their products until July 2025.</p>
<p>A report from the World Wildlife Fund showed that Europe's imports of products linked to forest-clearing caused the second-most deforestation in the world in 2017. That year, China was first. An expert said the new European rule could help prevent more deforestation and push farmers around the world to plant trees, vines and grasses.</p>
<p>Helen Bellfield is a policy director at Global Canopy, a nonprofit organization based in Britain. It suggests business change their production methods that hurt the environment.</p>
<p>She said the new EU rules could force governments to help farmers make changes. On the other hand, farmers could just sell to countries outside of the EU.</p>
<p>The world's top coffee producers include Vietnam, Ethiopia and Peru. Growers in those countries worry they will no longer be able to sell in Europe.</p>
<p>The new EU rules could help coffee farmers like Le Van Tam of Vietnam who has taken the environment into account. He first planted coffee in the Central Highlands area in 1995. At the time, he cleared land so he could grow as much coffee as possible. But in 2019, he changed his growing methods. Instead of using lots of fertilizers and <strong>pesticides</strong>, he started planting tamarind trees that add nutrients to the soil. He added black pepper vines and grass, which helps to keep the soil <strong>moist</strong> and prevents <strong>erosion</strong>. The changes qualified his coffee as "organic," which opened new markets and made his coffee more valuable. He did not produce more, but his profits went up, he said.</p>
<p>Vietnam hopes that more farmers will make changes, which will permit them to sell in Europe and maintain the nation's rank as the world's second-largest coffee producer.</p>
<p>The news is not as good for those in Ethiopia and Peru. Orders for Ethiopian coffee are already falling and Peru's farmers who are in the Amazon River area may not be able to provide information required by the EU.</p>
<p>"There will be winners and losers," Bellfield said.</p>
<p>Vietnam depends on Europe for 40 percent of its coffee sales. As soon as the new rules came out, the country began working to maintain its market share.</p>
<p>Vietnamese officials worked with small farmers to make sure their land met the new EU requirements. In addition, it made a database showing where its coffee came from. Farmers like Tam got special <strong>certificates</strong> from international agencies that proved how his beans were grown.</p>
<p>Tam said the extra work will be worth it because, even if his costs are higher, he can get more money for his coffee. "Otherwise, we will always be laborers," he said.</p>
<p>Small Vietnamese farmers still must get ready for the new rules. They will need technology to prove where their beans came from and that their land is certified by the EU. They will also need to be sure the qualified beans are not mixed with banned beans. From the harvest to shipment, new systems must be put into place to prevent errors.</p>
<p>Brazil is another big coffee-producing nation. Since it already sells a lot to Europe, experts say most of its products already meet EU requirements.</p>
<p>But farmers in Peru and Ethiopia may need more time. Gizat Worku is head of the Ethiopian Coffee Exporters Association. He said collecting data about the land of millions of small farmers will be a problem. "That requires a huge amount of resources," he said.</p>
<p>Gizat said orders from Europe are already falling. Some coffee exporters are thinking about selling to the Middle East and China instead. Ethiopian coffee sells well in those places.</p>
<p>"These regulations are going to have a <strong>tremendous</strong> impact," Gizat said.</p>

<p>In southeastern Kenya earlier this year, people from Kasengela village built a special kind of dam. The barrier is called a sand dam. It reduces water flow and increases the amount of wet sand behind it.</p>
<p>Sand dams are becoming more common in Kenya and other countries. Local people say the dams save time and labor because they can get water more easily during dry seasons.</p>

<p>"When I think about sand dams, I feel happy," said Peter, a farmer. "Our <strong>shallow</strong> well does not dry. It goes all through the dry seasons."</p>
<p>Before they built the dams, she and her children would walk many kilometers to get water. It took them three hours, and they would hurt their feet on rocks.</p>
<p>Mwanzia Mutua is the leader of the group who built the Kasengela dam. He said that he used to walk seven kilometers from his home to the Athi River to get water. He spent a whole day on the road. The sand dam will reduce the walk to 10 minutes, he said.</p>
<p>"When water is far, you spend all your time looking for it and are unable to do any other work," said the farmer. "Cattle die because the water is far."</p>
<p><strong>How the dams work</strong></p>
<p>In Kenya, rain falls only part of the year. Some rivers become dry soon after the rains stop. However, these rivers have a sandy bottom, and the sand can hold water.</p>
<p>The dams are made of concrete and block some of the sand and water. As a result, wet sand builds up behind the dam. This sand can hold enough water for people to use during dry weather. To get the water, they use a hand pump to pull water from the sand.</p>
<p>Experts say the dams also help area plants grow and add to groundwater.</p>
<p>However, sand dams only work in some areas. A study in Kitui County found that about half of 116 sand dams were not working. The<strong> </strong>study said the amount of rainfall, and the amount of <strong>clay </strong>and rock in the soil are important.</p>
<p>"You cannot put a sand dam anywhere," said Keziah Ngugi, a <strong>hydrologist</strong> and lead writer of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Growing numbers</strong></p>
<p>Makueni County has nearly 245,000 households. But clean piped water reached only five percent of them in 2022.</p>
<p>That is one reason the Makueni County government has been building sand dams with partner organizations and local groups. By 2022, it had built 71, county government records show.</p>
<p>The Africa Sand Dam Foundation (ASDF) helped build the dams in Kyalika and Kasengela. The communities provide sand, rocks and other locally available material, and labor. The British nonprofit uses partners to provide cement and workers with special skills. After building is complete, the community oversees the sand dam.</p>
<p>Since it started in 2010, the nonprofit has helped build 680 sand dams in three counties.</p>
<p>"We've used this model for years, and we've seen its success," said Andrew Musila. He is development director at ASDF.</p>
<p>The organization has also worked with governments and other nonprofits in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Somalia and India.</p>
<p>The sand dam in Kasengela was completed on March 14, and should be ready to use by December 2025, after it fills with sand.</p>

<p>Australia will soon begin enforcing <strong>stricter</strong> visa rules for foreign students. The move comes as official data showed migration hit another record high.</p>
<p>The new rules took effect on March 23. The rules will increase English language requirements for student visas.</p>
<p>The new rules will also give the government the power to suspend education providers from <strong>recruiting</strong> international students if they repeatedly break rules.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Students walk past stalls during the orientation week at The University of Sydney, in Camperdown, Australia February 15, 2023.

<p>"The actions this weekend will continue to drive migration levels down while delivering on our commitments in the migration strategy to fix the broken system we <strong>inherited</strong>," Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said in a statement.</p>
<p>A new "<strong>genuine</strong> student test" will be introduced to block international students who look to come to Australia for work reasons instead of education reasons. The government will also enforce "no further stay" conditions on visitor visas.</p>
<p>The moves follow several actions last year to end COVID-<strong>era</strong> exceptions introduced by the former government. Those rules included unrestricted working hours for international students.</p>
<p>Australia increased its yearly migration numbers in 2022 to help businesses deal with worker shortages caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic brought strict border controls and kept foreign students and workers out for nearly two years.</p>
<p>But the sudden increase of foreign workers and students has worsened pressure on an already <strong>tight</strong> rental market. Demand for <strong>rental</strong> housing across Australia was already higher than the supply of available housing.</p>
<p>Australia's Department of Education <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-numbers-country-state-and-territory">says there were more than 567,000 international students</a> in the country as of January 2024. That is a 26 percent increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Almost all of the international students in Australia come from Asia. The top five countries are China, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Vietnam. That information comes from Australia's Department of Education.</p>
<p>Overall, Australia's population rose 2.5 percent - the fastest increase on record - to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population#:~:text=Statistics%20in%20this%20release%20are,people%20at%2030%20September%202023.">26.8 million people last year</a>.</p>
<p>The record migration has expanded the labor supply and reduced pressures to raise wages.</p>
<p>O'Neil, the Home Affairs Minister, said the government's actions since September have led to a drop in migration levels. She added that recent international student visa approvals were down by 35 percent compared to the year before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>A container ship smashed into a major bridge in Baltimore, Maryland early Tuesday, causing it to collapse. The accident sent several vehicles and people into the river and closed one of the busiest ports in the United States.<br/>
周二早些时候，一艘集装箱船撞向马里兰州巴尔的摩市的一座大桥，导致大桥坍塌。事故导致数辆车和数人坠入河中，并导致美国最繁忙的港口之一被关闭。</p>
<p>A work crew was on the Francis Scott Key Bridge at the time of the collapse at about 5:30 UTC time. Rescuers pulled two survivors from the eight-degree Celsius water. Officials said they are still searching for six members of the crew and others believed to have been thrown into the water by the collapse. A state transportation official said radar identified vehicles under about 15 meters of water.<br/>
弗朗西斯·斯科特·基大桥在协调世界时5:30左右坍塌时，一个施工队正在桥上。救援人员从8摄氏度的水中救出两名幸存者。官员们表示，他们仍在搜寻据信因坍塌掉入水中的6名施工人员以及其他人员。一名州交通官员表示，雷达探测到大约15米深的水下有车辆。</p>
<p>At an early morning news conference, Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the ship's crew told officials that the ship had lost power shortly before it struck the bridge.<br/>
在凌晨的新闻发布会上，马里兰州州长韦斯·摩尔表示，该船的船员告诉官员，这艘船在撞上大桥前不久就失去了动力。</p>
<p>The 300-meter-long container ship is named Dali. The Dali is registered in Singapore. It had just left the port of Baltimore and was heading to Colombo, Sri Lanka. Synergy Marine Group, the ship owner, confirmed that the accident happened while the ship was under control of local pilots whose job it is to guide boats into and out of the port.<br/>
这艘300米长的集装箱船是达利号。达利号在新加坡注册。它刚刚离开巴尔的摩港，正驶向斯里兰卡的科伦坡。船东Synergy Marine Group证实，事故发生时，该船由当地领航员控制，领航员的工作是引导船只进出港口。</p>
<p>The ship smashed into one of the bridge's supports, causing the whole structure to break apart like a toy. Video of the accident posted on social media shows parts of the bridge fell into the water almost immediately. The ship also reportedly caught fire with thick, black smoke rising. No one was hurt on the ship.<br/>
该船撞上了大桥的一个支座，导致整个结构像玩具一样断裂。社交媒体上发布的事故视频显示，大桥的一部分几乎立即坠入水中。据报道，该船还起火，浓烟滚滚。船上无人受伤。</p>
<p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said, "Never would you think that you would see, physically see, the Key Bridge tumble down like that. It looked like something out of an action movie."<br/>
巴尔的摩市长布兰登·斯科特说：“我们从来没有想过会看到弗朗西斯·斯科特·基大桥像这样倒塌。它看起来就像动作电影里发生的事情。”</p>
<p>The Key Bridge fell late at night when traffic was light. During the day, thousands of cars travel across the bridge. It is part of the U.S. interstate highway system.<br/>
弗朗西斯·斯科特·基桥在深夜交通流量不大时发生倒塌。白天会有成千上万的汽车驶过大桥。它是美国州际公路系统的一部分。</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Baltimore Fire Department told The Associated Press that several vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse. That included at least one large truck.<br/>
巴尔的摩消防局发言人告诉美联社，坍塌时桥上有几辆车。其中包括至少一辆大卡车。</p>
<p>Maryland officials said Tuesday that all ship traffic into and out of the Port of Baltimore would be suspended. They expected highway traffic along the East Coast of the U.S. to be disrupted for a long time.<br/>
马里兰州官员周二表示，所有进出巴尔的摩港的船只都将暂停。他们预计美国东海岸的高速公路交通将长期中断。</p>
<p>Marine Traffic is a service that follows ship traffic. It reports that more than 40 ships, including small cargo ships and other boats, are still inside Baltimore Harbor. The data shows at least 30 other ships were planning to go to the port.<br/>
“海上交通”是一项跟踪船舶交通的服务。据其报道，有40多艘船只仍在巴尔的摩港内，包括小型货船和其他船只。数据显示，至少有30艘其它船只计划前往该港口。</p>
<p>Last year, the Port of Baltimore handled a record 47 million metric tons of foreign cargo worth $80 billion. The port deals with more imports and exports for major car companies than any other port in the U.S. In addition to cargo, more than 444,000 passengers passed through the port in 2023 for pleasure trips.<br/>
去年，巴尔的摩港处理了创纪录的4700万公吨进口货物，价值800亿美元。该港口为大型汽车公司处理的进出口业务比美国任何其他港口都多。除货物外，2023年还有超过44.4万名乘客通过该港口进行游览。</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council is demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Some members are concerned that a <strong>famine</strong> might have begun.</p>
<p>The territory's civilians are reportedly eating a wild plant called Khobiza because they lack other food to eat. The plant is an herb known as mallow.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Displaced Palestinian man Wael Al-Attar eats Khobiza, a wild leafy vegetable, with his family as they break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan, at a school where they shelter, in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, March 22, 2024.

<p>The Palestinian area has faced five months of war following the October attack on Israel by its Hamas rulers. Israeli officials say the terrorist group killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages.</p>
<p>Israel <strong>responded</strong> to the attack by launching air strikes and shelling in Gaza. Hamas' health officials in Gaza say 32,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict. It is the worst conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>"All our lives -- even through (previous) wars -- we have not eaten Khobiza," said a Palestinian woman named Maryam Al-Attar.</p>
<p>She said, "My daughters tell me, 'We want to eat bread, mother.' My heart breaks for them."</p>
<p>Al-Attar continued, "I can't find a piece of bread for them. I go and gather some Khobiza. We have found Khobiza for now, but in the future, where will we get it from? Khobiza will run out. Where do we turn?"</p>
<p>The war is continuing during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Millions of Muslims around the world enjoy big meals after sunset with their families and watch special television shows.</p>
<p>"We have been <strong>consumed</strong> by hunger. We have nothing to eat. We <strong>crave</strong> vegetables, fish, and meat. We fast with empty stomachs. We can no longer fast. We are <strong>dizzy</strong> from hunger," said Umm Mohamed. She said there was nothing to help the body deal with fasting during Ramadan.</p>
<p>The Integrated Food-Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a website that examines food and security. It says famine is likely to begin by May in northern Gaza. A severe lack of food could spread across the rest of the area by July.</p>
<p>Reports say that Khobiza will only provide temporary help. The aid situation for Gaza is also not clear. Negotiators are working on the terms of a ceasefire and the release of hostages.</p>
<p>Recently, an Israeli government spokesperson said Israel will stop working with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in the Gaza strip. It is the largest aid group in Gaza. Israel says the aid agency is causing the conflict to go on longer.</p>
<p>Israel in January accused 12 of UNRWA's 13,000 workers in Gaza of taking part in the October 7 attack. That led several donor countries to stop giving financial support to the group.</p>
<p>UNRWA dismissed some of its workers. It said it acted in order to protect the agency's ability to provide aid in Gaza. And an independent internal U.N. investigation was launched.</p>

<p>My name is Larisa Dashevska, and I have been teaching English for 25 years in Kherson, Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukraine has had a complex history and faced many challenges. But nothing could have prepared Ukrainians for the ordeal of the Russian occupation of Kherson.</p>
<p>As a resident of Kherson, I lived through the occupation and witnessed the effect of war on our city, our people, and our way of life.</p>
<p>The arrival of Russian forces in Kherson marked the beginning of a time of uncertainty and danger. There were daily explosions. The once-familiar streets were now unrecognizable, with craters and debris marring the landscape. The sounds of shelling and gunfire created a miserable backdrop to our daily lives.</p>
<p>Among the residents of Kherson, there were a lot of people who refused to accept the occupation. In spring 2022 they gathered in groups and took to the streets, waving Ukrainian flags and chanting slogans of freedom - "Kherson is Ukraine!". Despite the fear, brave people knew they had to stand up for their homeland.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the resistance against the enemy army, I remembered a very brave act of a local resident. The man was filmed climbing directly onto a Russian tank and waving the Ukrainian flag.</p>
<p>But as the days passed, the situation grew more dangerous. The explosions became more frequent, and the fighting intensified. The occupiers started to prohibit demonstrations and used weapons to break them up.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I had to help my students deal with the trauma they were experiencing. Our schools, places of learning and personal growth, were now places of uncertainty and fear.</p>
<p>I was a teacher of 10–11-year-old students with inclusive education and special needs. They needed my presence in their lives. During that period, we had online lessons every day and I made efforts to help them relax, feel less stress, and maintain a positive attitude despite the circumstances. I did this by creating a positive learning environment.</p>
<p>In spring 2022 our school year was one month shorter to avoid negative consequences. Also, the occupiers prohibited us from using modern platforms for studying and blocked the internet.</p>
<p>Each encounter with Russian soldiers patrolling our streets was filled with tension and anxiety. Their presence reminded us not only of the loss of freedom but also the stories of brutality throughout the city. It changed our way of life and introduced an element of fear that was impossible to escape.</p>
<p>As people saw Russian soldiers standing on every street corner and holding their guns, they tried to avoid such meetings. Soldiers looked at locals coldly and as if they owned the city.</p>
<p>Ukrainian banks ceased to function, leaving us with no access to our savings or financial resources. Ukrainian currency became worthless, and residents could not obtain basic needs. Once-thriving businesses shuttered, and people lost jobs.</p>
<p>Every visit to the market was a real challenge. Market stalls were filled with Russian goods, and the vendors whispered, as if afraid to say too much. People tried to quickly buy what they needed and hurried home.</p>
<p>Locals knew they were powerless against the invaders, but the occupiers couldn't break their spirit. Lots of citizens had the hope that one day, they would be free from the oppression of the Russian invaders.</p>
<p>During the occupation, people could not use modern mobile phones, because the occupiers could stop a person at any moment and start checking the contents and photos on the phone. If they found a photo of a person with national symbols or a Ukrainian embroidery, there were big problems. People were taken for questioning.</p>
<p>I found an old push-button telephone from my parents and used it throughout the occupation. It was not so scary, because there was no Internet and no social networks, photos and other unnecessary material for the invaders.</p>
<p>The Russian occupation of Kherson was, without a doubt, the darkest period in my life. But it was also a time that revealed the strength of the Ukrainian people. I watched neighbors come together to support one another and share whatever resources they had, whether it was food, warmth, or words of encouragement.</p>
<p>In occupied Kherson, many residents found themselves hiding in shelters to stay safe from the fighting and explosions.</p>
<p>They sat together, shared bread and simple food, surfed the Net and read the latest news of the occupied city and explosions. Despite the hardships they faced, locals knew they were not alone.</p>
<p>Once, there was a knock on the door of our building shelter. About 20 people were inside. Our hearts pounded with fear. Everyone was silent that moment. Soldiers checked shelters and tried to find partisans. Nobody answered and so they left without entering. We breathed with relief.</p>
<p>There is one moment I will always remember. It happened just after the deoccupation of the city. When the Russian invaders left our city, they blew up all important public utilities. Local residents were left without electricity and water for more than three weeks.</p>
<p>The people lived without all modern conveniences, but they were too happy to be rid of the enemy and their rule. Since no one had electricity in the city, some people had generators at home. My neighbor also had a generator and helped people all over the neighborhood charge their mobile phones and power banks. With charged phones, people could call their relatives and at least say a few words about their lives. We could only charge our phones a little once a day. Such nice people saved our lives.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I was determined to keep the story alive, even in the darkest of times, for the sake of my students and my country.</p>
<p>I'm Gena Bennett. And I'm Andrew Smith.</p>

<p>Scientists recently studied the <strong>fossil</strong> of a creature that lived in what is now the U.S. state of Texas about 270 million years ago. They named it Kermitops gratus in honor of Kermit the Frog from the children's television program <em>The Muppets</em>.</p>
<p>The fossil belongs to a group of animals that are thought to have given rise to modern-day frogs, salamanders, and limbless caecilians. Those animals, called <strong>amphibians</strong>, are creatures that can live both on land and in water.</p>
<p>And the study offers details into the history of how amphibians have <strong>evolved</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A composite image shows the fossil skull of the Permian Period proto-amphibian Kermitops (L) alongside a modern frog skull (Lithobates palustris), in this undated handout.

<p>Only the head, or skull, was discovered. It measured around three centimeters long. Researchers think the amphibian-like creature had a wide body that was around 15-18 centimeters long.</p>
<p>Amphibians are one of the four groups of living <strong>vertebrates</strong> on land. The others are reptiles, birds, and mammals. Special details, or features, on the Kermitops skull are providing researchers with more information about the history of amphibians.</p>
<p>Calvin So is a George Washington University doctoral student. And he is the lead writer of the study recently released in the publication <em>Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>.</p>
<p>So said Kermitops helps researchers understand the early history of amphibians by showing there is not a clear history "of step by step becoming more like the modern amphibian."</p>
<p>The fossil was collected in 1984 near Lake Kemp in Texas. It was kept in the large collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. But it was not fully studied until recently.</p>
<p>Kermitops had facial features that were similar to frogs and salamanders. But it had palpebral bones or eyelid bones, that are not found in modern amphibians.</p>
<p>So said, "The length of the skull in front of the eyes is longer than the length of the skull behind the eyes, which differs from the other fossil amphibians living at the same time." He added that it might have enabled Kermitops to close its mouth faster than others to capture insects as food.</p>
<p>So added, "We really thought it looked like Kermit the Frog." That led researchers to name it Kermitops, meaning "Kermit face."</p>
<p>Kermitops lived about 20 million years before the worst mass die-off, or extinction, in Earth's history. And it appeared about 40 million years before the first dinosaurs. It lived alongside other members that formed the amphibian group.</p>
<p>The environment in which Kermitops lived appears to have changed back and forth between warm and wet seasons and hot and dry seasons.</p>
<p>So said, "This environment would be similar to modern-day <strong>monsoons</strong> that take place in the Southwest U.S. and Southeast Asia."</p>
<p>The fossil record of early amphibians and their ancestors is not complete. That makes it difficult to understand the beginnings of modern amphibians.</p>
<p>Arjan Mann of the National Museum of Natural History helped write the study. He said Kermitops shows the importance "of continuing to add new fossil data to understanding this evolutionary problem."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A United Nations report warns that no longer used electronics, called "e-waste," is increasing worldwide. It adds that recycling rates of e-waste remain low.<br/>
联合国的一份报告警告称，被称为“电子垃圾”的废弃电子产品正在全球范围内增加。它补充说，电子垃圾的回收率仍然很低。</p>
<p>The waste comes from devices such as mobile phones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers, and solar panels.<br/>
这些废弃物来自手机、电子玩具、电视、微波炉、电子烟、笔记本电脑和太阳能电池板等设备。</p>
<p>The report does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which are counted separately.<br/>
该报告不包括电动汽车产生的废弃物，这些是单独计算的。</p>
<p>The U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the research group UNITAR wrote the report. It said about 62 million metric tons of "e-waste" were created in 2022. The report estimates the amount will increase 32 percent by 2030. The report said metals, including copper, gold, and iron, worth a total of about $91 billion are wasted.<br/>
联合国国际电信联盟（ITU）和联合国训练研究所（UNITAR）撰写了这份报告。它表示，2022年产生了约6200万公吨的“电子垃圾”。该报告估计，到2030年，这一数字将增长32%。报告称，包括铜、金和铁在内的总价值约910亿美元的金属被浪费了。</p>
<p>The U.N. said 22 percent of e-waste was collected and recycled in 2022. The U.N. agencies expect that amount to fall to 20 percent by 2030 for several reasons. These include the increasing number of devices, lack of repairs, shorter device lifespan, and not enough waste management systems.<br/>
联合国表示，2022年有22%的电子垃圾被收集和回收。联合国机构预计，到2030年，这一比例将降至20%，原因有几个。其中包括设备数量不断增加、缺乏维修、设备寿命缩短以及没有足够的废弃物管理系统。</p>
<p>Some of the e-waste contains dangerous substances, such as the element mercury, the report said. It also contains some rare-earth metals needed to make electronic devices. Currently, recycling supplies only one percent of the demand for the 17 rare metals.<br/>
报告称，一些电子垃圾含有危险物质，如汞元素。它还包含一些制造电子设备所需的稀土金属。目前，回收仅能满足17种稀有金属需求的1%。</p>
<p>The report said about half of all e-waste comes from Asia where few countries have laws on e-waste or collection targets. Recycling and collection rates are more than 40 percent in Europe. However, Europe also produces the highest amount of e-waste per person: nearly 18 kilograms.<br/>
报告称，大约一半的电子垃圾来自亚洲，那里很少有国家对电子垃圾或收集目标立法。欧洲的回收率超过40%。然而，欧洲人均产生的电子垃圾量也是最高的，达到了将近18公斤。</p>
<p>Africa has the least e-waste of any of the five big regions worldwide. However, its recycling and collection rates are about 1 percent, the report said.<br/>
在全球五大区域中，非洲的电子垃圾最少。然而，报告称，其回收率约为1%。</p>
<p>"The latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow," said Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava. He is head of the ITU telecommunication development group.<br/>
科斯马斯·勒克森·扎瓦扎瓦说：“最新研究表明，电子垃圾带来的全球挑战只会越来越大。”他是际电信联盟电信发展局局长。</p>

<p>For some people, e-waste is a way to earn money by looking through trash to find valuable metals and parts. However, the work comes with health risks.<br/>
对一些人来说，电子垃圾是一种通过在垃圾中寻找有价值的金属和零件来赚钱的方式。然而，这项工作也有健康风险。</p>

<p>"When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health," he said. He added that when the e-waste heats up, it releases harmful gases and he "can't come to work because of chest problems."<br/>
他说：“当电子垃圾扔到这里时，它里面含有一些粉末，这会影响我的健康。”他补充说，当电子垃圾温度升高时，它会释放有害气体，他“因为胸部症状无法工作”。</p>
<p>Still, Okoth said he and others like him don't have any other choice: "We are now used to the smoke because if you don't go to work, you will not eat."<br/>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A new way to fight an extremely aggressive kind of brain <strong>tumor</strong> is showing promise in two experiments with a small number of patients.</p>
<p>For the experiments, scientists took patients' own <strong>immune </strong>cells and turned them into "living drugs" that can find and attack the tumor, called glioblastoma. Researchers have reported that, in early tests, the immune cells have made the tumors temporarily smaller.</p>
<p>The treatment is called CAR-T <strong>therapy. </strong>Doctors already use the treatment to fight blood-related cancers like leukemia. But researchers have struggled to make CAR-T therapy work for solid tumors.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This combination of MRI scan images provided by the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2024 shows the progress of a glioblastoma patient who received CAR-T therapy which uses modified versions of T cells from a patient's own immune system.

(NEJM via AP)</span></div>
<p>Now, separate teams at both Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania are developing next-generation CAR-T therapy treatments. They are designed to get past some of glioblastoma's defenses.</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania's Dr. Stephen Bagley led one of the studies. He warned, "It's very early days." But he added, "We're <strong>optimistic</strong> that we've got something to build on here..."</p>
<p>Glioblastoma is the brain cancer that killed U.S. President Joe Biden's son Beau Biden. It also took the life of longtime Arizona Senator John McCain.</p>
<p>Glioblastoma is fast-growing and hard to treat. Patients usually live 12 to 18 months after <strong>diagnosis</strong>. Even after many years of research, there are few options if the cancer returns after treatments.</p>
<p>A kind of cell in the immune system called T cells fight disease, but cancer has ways to hide. With CAR-T therapy, doctors genetically change a patient's own T cells so they can better find different cancer cells.</p>
<p>But solid tumors like glioblastoma have an additional difficulty. They contain mixtures of cancer cells with different <strong>mutations. </strong>Targeting just one kind still means the other kinds can keep growing.</p>
<p>The teams at Massachusetts General Hospital and University of Pennsylvania each developed a therapy with two different methods. They tried them in patients whose tumors returned after usual treatment.</p>
<p>At Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Marcela Maus and her team combined CAR-T with T-cell <strong>engaging</strong> antibody molecules. T-cell engaging antibody molecules are molecules that can <strong>attract</strong> nearby, regular T cells to join in the cancer attack. The result, called CAR-TEAM, targets a protein called EGFR. EGFR is found in most glioblastomas but not in normal brain tissue.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania's method was to create a two-target CAR-T therapy. It hunts for both the EGFR protein plus a second protein found in many glioblastomas.</p>
<p>Both teams administered the treatment through a medical device called a catheter into the fluid that surrounds the brain.</p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital tested three patients with its CAR-TEAM therapy. Brain imagining a day or two later showed their tumors were quickly becoming smaller. The researchers reported their findings in the publication the <em>New England Journal of Medicine. </em></p>
<p>Maus said, "None of us could really believe it."</p>
<p>Two of the patients' tumors began to regrow soon. A second treatment given to one of them did not work. But one patient's <strong>response</strong> to the experimental treatment lasted more than six months.</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania researchers reported their findings in the publication <em>Nature Medicine</em>. They similarly found that in the first six patients given its therapy tumors got smaller. While some came back quickly, Bagley said one patient treated last August still has not had any regrowth.</p>
<p>For both teams, the goal is to see longer-lasting results.</p>
<p>Bagley said, "None of this is going to matter if it doesn't last."</p>

<p>Eleven-year-old twins Dao Bao Tran and her brother Do Hoang Trung live on a houseboat in Vietnam's Mekong <strong>Delta</strong>. But their dreams take them far away.</p>
<p>Tran loves K-pop. She watches videos at night to learn Korean and would love to visit Seoul. Her brother Trung wants to be a singer. But he says their hopes are "unrealistic." He adds, "I know I'll end up going to the city to try and make a living."</p>
<p>Trung sees the reality around him. Climate change is making the Mekong Delta one of the most at-risk areas in the world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Do Hoang Trung walks along a bamboo bridge to reach a houseboat he shares with his twin sister and grandmother in Vietnam, Jan. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-e0c7-08dc4448e26d_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Do Hoang Trung walks along a bamboo bridge to reach a houseboat he shares with his twin sister and grandmother in Vietnam, Jan. 16, 2024.

<p><strong>Difficult time in the Mekong Delta</strong></p>
<p>A United Nations climate change report in 2022 warned that there will be more floods<strong> </strong>in the wet season and <strong>drought</strong> in the dry season. Farming is getting harder with the loss of land due to the rising sea and the loss of water from <strong>dams</strong> on the river upstream.</p>
<p>The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry reported that the area's share of Vietnam's gross domestic product, or <strong>GDP</strong>, has dropped from 27 percent in 1990 to less than 18 percent in 2019.</p>
<p>Factory jobs in the city offer better wages. Therefore, the call of the city is often hard to ignore for the 17 million who live in the delta.</p>
<p>That is what Do Thi Son Ca, the single mother of the twins, did.</p>
<p>Soon after her children were born, Ca left the Mekong Delta to find work in Ho Chi Minh City. She left the children to live with her mother, Nguyen Thi Thuy, on a small houseboat ever since.</p>
<p>Thuy sells meat and bean buns at the Cai Rang floating market, the largest of its kind in the Mekong Delta. On good days, she makes about $4, hardly enough to feed her grandchildren.</p>
<p>The twins have already missed two years of school because their grandmother could not pay the costs. Their mother was struggling in the city and could not help either. Now their houseboat is in urgent need of costly repairs.</p>
<p>"The storms are becoming more violent," said the grandmother. With heavy rains, she must pump out water so her houseboat does not sink.</p>
<p><strong>Moving to the big city</strong></p>
<p>Moving away from the Mekong to bigger cities or even to other countries for a better life is not new.</p>
<p>Mimi Vu is a migration expert based in Ho Chi Minh City. Climate change, she said, has hurt <strong>livelihoods</strong> in the Mekong Delta. The area is less developed than other parts of Vietnam and lacks <strong>access</strong> to education, clean water, and health care.</p>
<p>"Every generation still struggles," Vu said. And moving to the city does not guarantee anything.</p>
<p>The mother of the twins found a job in a clothing factory in Ho Chi Minh City. She also got married and had a baby. But like thousands of workers in Vietnam, both she and her husband lost their jobs because of low overseas orders. They have since moved back to his home village.</p>
<p>"My family is poor. So I don't think too far ahead. I just hope my children can receive a full education," she said.</p>
<p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to strengthen the Mekong area's agricultural economy. It produces about half the country's rice and feeds other countries, like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plan includes trying new farming technologies, creating more fisheries, growing fruits, and building airports and highways to bring foreign investment.</p>
<p>But moving to Ho Chi Minh City is hard to resist for many, especially the young. Even those in the countryside see moving to the city as the fastest way out of poverty, said 23-year-old Trung Hieu.</p>
<p>Hieu shares a living space with another young man from the delta. After 12 hours of making parts in a factory, he works a second job transporting people on his motorcycle.</p>
<p>Hieu wanted to be a teacher. But his family had to choose whether to send him to college or let his younger sister finish school. He chose to move to the city so that he could send money back home.</p>
<p>"My sister is doing well in school. I'm very happy," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The American space agency NASA says the recent test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket demonstrated progress in several important areas even though the rocket was lost.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，太空探索技术公司星舰火箭最近的试飞表明其在几个重大领域取得了进展，尽管火箭最后飞丢了。</p>
<p>NASA is planning to use Starship to carry the first astronauts to the moon since the agency's Apollo 17 mission in 1972. But the spacecraft will have to pass additional testing before a moon mission.<br/>
美国宇航局计划使用星舰搭载自1972年阿波罗17号任务以来的第一批宇航员登月。但在执行月球任务之前，航天器必须通过额外的测试。</p>
<p>Such a mission would be part of NASA's Artemis program. The next planned trip in that program will be Artemis II, which is set for September 2025. NASA aims to send astronauts into orbit around the moon but will not attempt a landing on the lunar surface.<br/>
这项任务是美国宇航局阿尔忒弥斯项目的一部分。该项目的下一次计划之旅将是阿尔忒弥斯2号任务，定于2025年9月发射升空。美国宇航局的目标是将宇航员送入绕月轨道，但不会尝试在月球表面着陆。</p>
<p>Artemis III, planned for September 2026, will attempt to land astronauts on the surface of the moon. SpaceX's Starship rocket has been chosen for this mission.<br/>
计划于2026年9月发射的阿尔忒弥斯3号任务将试图让宇航员登上月球表面。太空探索技术公司的星舰火箭已被选中执行此次任务。</p>
<p>Both Artemis II and Artemis III have faced delays in planned launches.<br/>
阿尔忒弥斯2号和阿尔忒弥斯3号都面临计划发射推迟。</p>
<p>SpaceX's latest test flight of Starship took place on March 14. Starship was able to travel farther than ever before during the flight. But the rocket broke apart when attempting to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.<br/>
太空探索技术公司最新的星舰试飞于3月14日进行。在这次飞行中，星舰比以往任何时候都能飞得更远。但火箭在试图重新进入地球大气层时解体了。</p>
<p>At the time it broke apart, Starship was nearing a planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean, about one hour after launching from southern Texas.<br/>
解体时间是星舰从德克萨斯州南部发射约一小时后，当时它正接近计划在印度洋溅落。</p>
<p>During a live broadcast of the test flight, SpaceX confirmed that the rocket had been "lost" upon its re-entry attempt. Starship is designed to be reused.<br/>
在试飞的现场直播中，太空探索技术公司证实该火箭在试图重返大气层时“飞丢”了。星舰被设计为可重复使用。</p>
<p>Two Starship test flights last year both ended in explosions minutes after liftoff. By surviving for close to 50 minutes in its latest test, both SpaceX and NASA considered the effort a success.<br/>
去年的两次星舰试飞都在升空几分钟后以爆炸告终。它在最新的试飞中维持了近50分钟，让太空探索技术公司和美国宇航局都认为这一努力是成功的。</p>
<p>NASA chief Bill Nelson praised Starship's test after the launch on X. "Congrats to @SpaceX on a successful test flight! Starship has soared into the heavens. Together, we are making great strides through Artemis to return humanity to the Moon—then look onward to Mars."<br/>
美国宇航局局长比尔·纳尔逊于发射后在X网站上赞扬了这次星舰试飞：“祝贺SpaceX试飞成功！‘星舰’飞上天了。我们一起在阿耳忒弥斯计划中取得了巨大进步，要让人类重返月球，然后飞向火星。”</p>
<p>In a statement, NASA described the ways Starship's test brought the agency closer to being ready to fly astronauts to the moon.<br/>
美国宇航局在一份声明中描述了星舰试飞如何使该机构更接近于准备好将宇航员送上月球。</p>
<p>The space agency noted the rocket used its six Raptor engines to successfully separate from its first-stage Super Heavy booster. The Super Heavy itself was powered by 33 Raptor engines.<br/>
美国宇航局指出，该火箭使用了六台猛禽发动机，成功地与第一级超重型助推器分离。超重型助推器本身由33台猛禽发动机提供动力。</p>
<p>During a Starship launch test last April, several of the booster's 33 methane-fueled engines failed and the booster did not separate from the spacecraft. This caused the whole vehicle to explode and crash into the sea four minutes after liftoff.<br/>
在去年4月的一次星舰发射测试中，助推器的33台甲烷燃料发动机中有几台出现故障，并且助推器没有与航天器分离。这导致整个火箭在升空四分钟后爆炸并坠入大海。</p>
<p>SpaceX was able to double the length of the flight during another test in November. While all 33 engines fired and the booster fell away as planned, the flight ended in a pair of explosions, first the booster and then the spacecraft.<br/>
太空探索技术公司在11月的另一次测试中将飞行距离增加了一倍。当33台发动机全部启动，助推器按计划分离时，飞行以两次爆炸结束，首先是助推器爆炸，然后是飞船爆炸。</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) examined all the corrections made to Starship before approving the March 14 flight. The FAA said it was also investigating results of the latest flight.<br/>
美国联邦航空管理局在批准3月14日的飞行之前，审查了对星舰的所有修正。美国联邦航空局表示，他们也在调查最近一次飞行的结果。</p>
<p>The tests are important for NASA and SpaceX. They permit engineers "to test key systems and processes in flight scenarios" in an attempt to gather data to support the continued development of Starship, said Lisa Watson-Morgan. She is the Program Manager for the Starship program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.<br/>
这些测试对美国宇航局和太空探索技术公司都很重要。丽莎·沃特森-摩根表示，这允许工程师“在飞行场景中测试关键系统和流程”，试图收集数据以支持星舰的持续开发。她是阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔市美国宇航局马歇尔太空飞行中心星舰项目的项目经理。</p>
<p>SpaceX officials have said they plan to carry out at least six more test flights of Starship this year, if the company receives all necessary government approvals.<br/>
太空探索技术公司官员表示，如果该公司获得所有必要的政府批准，他们计划今年至少再进行6次星舰试飞。</p>

            <title>US Quickly Adds Storage Centers for Electricity  (2024/3/25)</title>

<span class="datetime">24 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>U.S. electricity providers are quickly adding <strong>batteries</strong> to store electricity in large amounts.</p>
<p>The batteries are mainly ones called lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Increasingly, companies are using these batteries with solar and wind projects. The agencies that run electric <strong>grids</strong>, <strong>utility</strong> companies and developers of renewable energy say combining technologies is necessary to use renewable energy in the future.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Mike Vandrely, construction manager, checks on a battery storage pod at Orsted's Eleven Mile Solar Center lithium-ion battery storage energy facility Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024, in Coolidge, Ariz.

<p><strong>Batteries to store electricity </strong></p>
<p>In the Arizona desert, a Danish company is building a large solar farm that includes batteries that <strong>charge </strong>when the sun is shining. The batteries are able to supply energy back to the electric grid when it is not.</p>
<p>Some people think combining batteries with green energy will result in a better climate. "Green energy" is a term used to describe ways of creating power that do not appear to cause pollution.</p>
<p>"Solar farms only produce when the sun shines, and the <strong>turbines</strong> only produce when the wind blows," said Orsted chief Mads Nipper. "For us to maximize the availability of the green power, <strong>24-7</strong>, we have to store some of it too."</p>
<p>Some people think batteries will permit renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. Batteries can help keep a steady flow of electricity when there is no wind or sun to produce it. For example, when people are sleeping at night and using less electricity, the energy produced from wind can be stored in batteries. Then, the stored energy can be used when demand is high during the day.</p>
<p>Juan Mendez of Tempe, Arizona, gets power from local utility Salt River Project (SRP), which is working with Orsted on the Eleven Mile Solar Center. As a state senator, Mendez pushed SRP to move to renewable energy.</p>
<p>Mendez thinks the power company is still investing too much in gas and coal plants. A major project is planned for a natural gas plant in Coolidge, Arizona, near the solar center.</p>
<p>"This solar-plus-storage is a good step, but SRP needs to do more to provide clean energy and clean up our air and help address climate change," Mendez said.</p>
<p>SPR said it is adding more renewable forms of electricity production. The company's board of directors recently promised to add no new carbon to the atmosphere, or to have "zero emissions," by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. efforts to expand batteries </strong></p>
<p>The United States is second in electrical storage in the world after China. In 2023, the U.S. added an estimated 7.5 gigawatts of electrical storage capacity. A report from BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy said that is 62 percent more than in 2022. That amount of electricity could power 750,000 homes for one day. The total amount of electricity storage capacity in the U.S. is enough for 2 million homes for one day, BloombergNEF estimates.</p>
<p>California has the most energy storage in the country. It has twice as much as any other state. <strong>Residential</strong>, <strong>commercial</strong> and utility-level battery <strong>capacity</strong> increased by 757 percent there over four years. The California Energy Commission said there is now enough electrical storage capacity to power 6.6 million homes for up to four hours.</p>
<p>Texas has the second-most battery storage after California. Last month, Schneider Electric announced it is working with energy company ENGIE North America on solar and battery systems in Texas. The aim is to get closer to the French multinational's 100 percent renewable energy goal in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Hans Royal is Schneider Electric's senior director for renewable energy and carbon advisory. He said the deal with ENGIE, and the necessary $80 million investment, would not have been possible without the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. That was a major climate-related law passed by the U.S. Congress in 2022.</p>
<p>Royal is advising other big companies he works with to get into the market for electricity storage.</p>
<p>"The industry needs that, the grid needs it," said Royal.</p>
<p><strong>The future </strong></p>
<p>Back in Arizona, Orsted's Eleven Mile Solar Center has 857,000 solar panels and more than 2,000 cubes that look like large shipping containers but contain batteries. Orsted also has large solar and storage projects in Texas and Alabama, and in Europe.</p>
<p>When the Arizona facility opens this summer, most power from the solar farm will go to Facebook owner Meta's data center in the town of Mesa. Any extra solar power, in addition to the power stored in the batteries, will go to the local utility's customers. The new batteries can ensure power to about 65,000 homes for a few hours of high demand.</p>
<p>"What I think is exciting is just how rapidly this market is moving," said Yayoi Sekine, head of energy storage at BloombergNEF.</p>

            <title>Study of Polyglots Shows How Brain Deals with Language  (2024/3/25)</title>

<p>Most people around the world speak one or two languages. But some can speak three or more. These people are called polyglots. And they are helping researchers better understand how the human brain deals with language.</p>
<p>In a new study, a team of scientists <strong>monitored</strong> the brain activity of 34 polyglots. The polyglots spoke between five and 54 languages.</p>
<p>The scientists used a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. In fMRI, the brain is studied through images that measure changes in blood flow in different areas of the brain. The researchers used fMRI to study the brain as the polyglots listened to different languages.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Children of a welcome class for migrants attend a German language lesson at the catholic Sankt Franziskus school in Berlin, Germany, January 22, 2016. (REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/34646f86-25b3-42da-b96f-533c85e7444d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Children of a welcome class for migrants attend a German language lesson at the catholic Sankt Franziskus school in Berlin, Germany, January 22, 2016. (REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>The researchers found that, when the polyglots heard a language they knew, activity increased in an area of the brain involved with language processing. That area is the cerebral cortex. When they listened to a language they did not know or knew less well, there was less activity in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Evelina Fedorenko is a brain scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research. She was also a senior writer of the study, which recently appeared in the publication <em>Cerebral Cortex.</em></p>
<p>She explained the findings.</p>
<p>"We think this is because when you process a language that you know well, you can <strong>engage</strong> the full <strong>suite</strong> of <strong>linguistic</strong> operations - the operations that the language system in your brain supports," Fedorenko said.</p>
<p>However, an exception caught the attention of the researchers. For many of the polyglot <strong>participants</strong>, listening to their native language produced less of a brain response compared to hearing other languages they knew. On average, the response was about 25 percent less. And in some of the polyglots, listening to their native language activated only one part of the brain's language network, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Olessia Jouravlev is a brain scientist at Carleton University in Canada. He also helped write the report. He said that the brain's neural processes were more efficient, or effective, when the polyglots heard their native language.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the language network in the brain does not activate as much when they do native versus non-native language processing," Jouravlev said.</p>
<p>The brain's language network involves a few areas in its frontal and temporal <strong>lobes</strong>.</p>
<p>Saima Malik-Moraleda is a doctoral student at the Harvard/MIT Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology. She was one of the lead writers of the study. She said the findings suggest that the way the brain finds, or extracts, meaning in language governs the brain's <strong>response</strong> to language.</p>
<p>"The more meaning you can extract from the language input you are receiving, the greater the response in language regions - except for the native language," she said.</p>
<p>Of the 34 polyglots who took part in the study, 20 were men and 14 were women. They were between 19 and 71 years old. Twenty-one were native English speakers. The rest were native speakers of French, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, German, Hungarian, and Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>Researchers monitored the polyglots' brain activity as they listened to recordings in eight languages. One was their native language. Three were languages they spoke well, somewhat well or somewhat. The other four were languages they did not know.</p>
<p>Half heard recordings of Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. The other half heard recordings of stories from the Christian religious book the Bible.</p>
<p>Fedorenko noted that a lot of work in language research has been centered on individuals with linguistic difficulties.</p>
<p>But she said there is a lot that researchers can learn about the language process by studying so-called language "experts," too. That includes polyglots, Fedorenko added.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This story is one of the winning entries from the "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/z/7773" target="_blank">Teach Us about Ukraine</a>" writing contest sponsored by VOA Learning English and GoGlobal.</em></p>
<p>Ukrainian schools have been changing since 2017 with the adoption of new laws and standards. But other events also led to the changes in the Ukrainian education system.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Teacher conducts an online chemistry lesson in a classroom at a school, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. 2, 2022. ( REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/09410000-0a00-0242-3698-08dad4a3d7d3_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Teacher conducts an online chemistry lesson in a classroom at a school, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. 2, 2022. ( REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko)</span></div>
<p>In September 2017, a new law, "<em>Law on Education</em>" was passed to establish the main principles of the new education system. And the cabinet of ministers, in February 2018, approved a new state standard of primary education.</p>
<p>The new standard was first tested in 100 schools across Ukraine during the 2017-2018 school year. And all first-graders around the country began to study under this new standard the following year.</p>
<p>Instead of memorizing facts and concepts, students are to acquire competencies and lifelong learning in several areas. More attention is paid to the "21st-century skills" of cooperation, communication, creativity, and critical thinking.</p>
<p>The reform, called "<em>New Ukrainian School</em>," had been discussed for years. However, some factors and events greatly influenced and brought the changes.</p>
<p>Another change to the Ukrainian education system came from the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools were closed during quarantine. Students did not go to school but started online learning. That, in turn, helped increase digital literacy. Teachers and students learned to use Zoom, Google Meet, Google Classroom and other digital applications. Teachers also learned to create video materials and develop interesting school work and exercises.</p>
<p>The emotional part of learning also changed. The friendly, warm atmosphere and the feeling of home and unity appeared in the lessons. The following lesson is an example:</p>
<p><em>"Would you, please, read, Mathew?," asks the teacher </em></p>
<p><em>"Can you show us your cat?," Mathew replies </em></p>
<p><em>"Well, we are going to do our tasks first, and we'll have five minutes at the end of the lesson to show our pets." </em></p>
<p>At the beginning of online learning, many students kept their cameras off during the lesson. Some were shy. Others did not like how they looked and did not want to show their faces. As time went on, students began to feel more comfortable and turned their cameras on. Besides, how can you show your cat without the camera?</p>
<p>The situation changed again in February 2022, with the Russian invasion. Cities and villages were attacked. Some were occupied. Others lost electricity and internet. And there was no learning for months. In September, online learning restarted with a different mood. Students would ask each other:</p>
<p><em>"Hello, Nick. How are you?" </em></p>
<p><em>"Fine." </em></p>
<p><em>"Is everything all right?" </em></p>
<p><em>"Yes." </em></p>
<p>But everyone understands that everything is not all right. They give short answers in a low voice. Students in the Russian-occupied territory are not permitted to study at Ukrainian schools. Their cameras are off. It is not because of shyness. It is because of fear. But the rest of the students turn off their cameras, too. It is done in solidarity. Even as teenagers, they are old enough to understand what danger means.</p>
<p>So, Ukrainian schools are now changing. The changes are not just in buildings, lessons, competencies or methods. The changes are in people's lives.</p>

<p>South Korean researchers have combined cow muscle cells with rice grains. They say the new rice is an important step towards a <strong>sustainable</strong>, less costly source of protein. The researchers suggested it could replace the meat of farmed cattle, or beef.</p>
<p>Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University led the research. Hong said the "beef rice" is the first product of its kind. The results of the research were recently published in <em>Matter.</em></p>
<p>The beef rice uses grain particles as the base for growing animal muscle and fat cells.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Hybrid beef rice, elaborated using cow muscle and fat stem cells, is set on a table at the Reuters studio in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c5b8b96f-38d6-4fe5-b920-668a9317c04f_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Hybrid beef rice, elaborated using cow muscle and fat stem cells, is set on a table at the Reuters studio in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon)</span></div>
<p>The researchers treated rice grains with chemicals called enzymes to create an environment for cell growth. They added cells from cattle to create the final product, which is a combination, or hybrid, of the two. The result looks like a grain of rice with a <strong>pink</strong> color.</p>
<p>Companies around the world have launched efforts to develop meat that is grown in a laboratory. One of the latest attempts involves plant-based chicken and eel meat developed from soybean that is sold in Singapore.</p>
<p>Hong's team said rice has an added gain in terms of safety compared to soy or nuts because fewer people have <strong>allergic </strong>reactions to it.</p>
<p>He said that if it is developed into food products, "cultured beef rice could serve as a sustainable protein source." He added that it would be good in environments where traditional animal farming is too difficult.</p>
<p>The beef rice contains around eight percent more protein and seven percent more fat than normal rice. Hong noted the protein is 18 percent animal based. That makes it a good source of important nutrients needed by humans called essential amino acids.</p>
<p>Beef rice costs about two dollars per kilogram. Hong said it results in the release of less carbon gas than traditional cattle raising. He said that it could compete with other products in stores.</p>
<p>Hong said there are still some problems in production. And, he added, it will not be easy to get people to accept its taste and how it feels in the mouth, or its texture.</p>
<p>Keum Dong-kyu recently ate the beef rice at a restaurant in the Korean capital Seoul. He praised the new idea.</p>
<p>Keum said, "But honestly, I don't think it can <strong>replicate</strong> the <strong>juiciness</strong> or texture of real beef."</p>
<p>Christian Krammel, who is from Germany, expressed hope for the future.</p>
<p>Krammel said, "Now, it does not compare to beef yet, but as I see the research is in early stages, I would say it's a great way forward."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Do you like to learn about <u>ancient history</u>? If you do, you could call yourself a history <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/a-23-2007-03-19-voa1-83133537/127470.html">buff</a>. If you are a "buff," you have a strong interest in a subject and want to learn all about it.</p>
<p>History buffs can have a special interest in a particular historical period in the past. For example, they might read a lot about ancient Greek or Roman history. History buffs might be interested in ancient Mesopotamia or Carthage. Or perhaps the ancient Mayans or Incas would be <u>up their alley</u>. If something is <u>up your alley</u>, it goes along with your interests. It is something you want to know more about.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People gather at Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, June 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-6bc1-08db726e0f1e_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - People gather at Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, June 21, 2023.

<p>However, English speakers use the expression <u>ancient history</u> in other ways. And many have nothing to do with exploring cultures from long ago.</p>
<p>For example, if something is <u>ancient history</u>, it is no longer meaningful or <strong>relevant</strong>. It is outdated or totally forgotten. Something that is <u>ancient history</u> is old news.</p>
<p>Let's say a business owner wants to modernize and update her workspace. She says she wants to get a new fax machine. But then, her young son tells her fax machines are <u>ancient history</u>.</p>
<p><u>Ancient history</u> can describe events in a person's past. Let's say a co-worker always talks about his time in high school. When he asks about yours, you might say that your high school days are <u>ancient history</u>. You barely remember them.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use <u>ancient history</u> to mean something has been completely forgotten – even if it is a fairly recent event. It just feels like it happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>For example, two friends of yours want to start a business together. Last month, it was a café. Now, their latest idea is offering storage units for <strong>rent</strong>. When you ask about the café idea, they might say, "Oh, that idea is <u>ancient history</u>. We've moved on from that."</p>
<p>We also use <u>ancient history</u> in another way. Sometimes <u>ancient history</u> means an issue has been resolved and is no longer a problem. It is <u>water under the bridge</u>. <u>Water under the bridge</u> is another idiom that means a problem no longer exists.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you had an unpleasant experience with a good friend, but it happened years ago. You both value your friendship and choose <u>to forgive and forget</u>. The problem is no longer an issue between the two of you. It is <u>ancient history</u>.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Historic covered bridges in the United States are under threat by the use of the modern technology GPS.<br/>
美国历史悠久的廊桥正受到GPS这种现代技术的威胁。</p>
<p>GPS is short for Global Positioning System. The satellite system tells people who use map applications what roads to use to go from one place to another.<br/>
GPS是全球定位系统的缩写。这种卫星系统会告诉地图应用程序的用户从一地到另一地走什么路。</p>
<p>The historic bridges usually have signs, including flashing lights, to warn trucks that are too tall or too heavy not to cross. But some truck drivers do not follow the warnings and crash into the bridge. They say the GPS directed them onto the bridge. Many times, the drivers are using systems made for cars instead of large trucks.<br/>
历史悠久的桥梁通常都有标志，包括闪光灯，以警告那些太高或太重而无法通过的卡车。但一些卡车司机没有听从警告，然后撞上了桥。他们说GPS指引他们上了桥。很多时候，这些司机都是使用为小汽车而不是为大卡车制作的系统。</p>
<p>In the northeastern state of Vermont, Lyndon town officials say the 146-year-old Miller's Bridge has been hit more than 20 times.<br/>
在东北部佛蒙特州，林登镇官员说，有146年历史的米勒大桥已经被撞了20多次。</p>
<p>Justin Smith is an administrator for Lyndon. "GPS is the most general excuse that is given by drivers that do hit the bridge," he said. Drivers can face a fine of $5,000 from the town, plus payments to the state. But he added that the real problem is drivers simply not thinking about their actions.<br/>
贾斯汀·史密斯是林登镇的行政长官。他说：“GPS是那些撞上大桥的司机给出的最普遍的借口。”司机可能面临该镇5000美元的罚款，以及州政府的罚款。但他补充说，真正的问题是司机根本不考虑自己的行为。</p>
<p>Jack Harris is the head of Lyndon's police. He said that the bridge had to be closed twice for major repairs. Each time, it took several months to finish the job.<br/>
杰克·哈里斯是林登<span style="font-size: 9pt;">镇</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">的警察局长。他说，为了进行大修，这座桥不得不关闭两次。每次都要花几个月的时间才能完成这项工作。</span></p>
<p>In 2019, a truck hit the bridge supports. Engineering and repair costs were nearly $100,000, said Smith.<br/>
2019年，一辆卡车撞上了桥梁支座。史密斯说，工程和维修费用将近10万美元。</p>
<p>About half the time, the town gets its money back through the drivers' insurance — if it catches them. Many drivers simply drive away without telling officials about the accident. A nearby security camera aimed at the bridge has helped officials find some drivers.<br/>
大约有一半的时间，小镇能通过司机的保险拿回钱 — 如果抓到了他们的话。许多司机在没有告诉官员发生事故的情况下就直接开车离开了。附近的安防摄像头对准了大桥，帮助官员找到了一些司机。</p>
<p>"They will claim that they didn't know they hit it and yet you'll see the truck stop in the middle of the bridge and they'll look up to see that they're hitting the bridge," Police Chief Harris said.<br/>
警察局长哈里斯说：“他们会声称不知道自己撞到了桥上，但你会看到卡车停在桥中央，他们会抬头看到自己撞上了桥。”</p>
<p>Bill Caswell is president of the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges. He said trucks have damaged many covered bridges in Vermont and other states like Illinois and Ohio.<br/>
比尔·卡斯维尔是美国国家廊桥保护协会主席。他说，卡车损坏了佛蒙特州、伊利诺伊州和俄亥俄州等州的许多廊桥。</p>
<p>Caswell said trucks hit a covered bridge in Cobb County, Georgia, so many times that officials put metal barriers at each end of it. The bridge also has warning signs and flashing lights.<br/>
卡斯韦尔说，卡车多次撞上佐治亚州科布县的一座廊桥，以至于官员们在桥的两端都设置了金属护栏。这座桥还设有警告标志和闪光灯。</p>
<p>"Even with all the warnings, the barriers are still struck," Caswell wrote to The Associated Press. "But the bridge is now protected."<br/>
卡斯韦尔在给美联社的信中写道：“即使有了这些警告设施，护栏仍然被撞。但这座桥现在受到了保护。”</p>
<p>Back in Lyndon, the town is looking at plans to put a steel beam in front of the bridge. The beam would force trucks that are too tall to come to a stop.<br/>
说回林登，该镇正考虑在大桥前安装限高杆的计划。限高杆会迫使太高的卡车停车。</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said their Google Maps' app is made for drivers of cars and small trucks. The spokesperson added that drivers of larger vehicles should use different systems.<br/>
谷歌发言人表示，他们的谷歌地图应用程序是为汽车和小型卡车司机设计的。发言人补充说，大型车辆的驾驶员应该使用不同的系统。</p>
<p>Apple also has a "Maps" app. The company did not answer an Associated Press email asking for comment.<br/>
苹果公司也有“地图”应用程序。该公司没有回复美联社要求置评的电子邮件。</p>
<p>In Lyndon, there are different ideas in town about what to do, said Smith, the administrator.<br/>
行政长官史密斯表示，林登镇对该做怎么办意见不一。</p>
<p>"Some people obviously want to see something that protects the bridge so we can keep it in place," he said. "Others are like: ‘It's time to take it off and set it on the side and put a more standard bridge in."<br/>
他说：“有些人显然想看到对大桥做一些保护，这样我们就可以把它保护下来。其他人则想：‘是时候把它拆了放到一边，然后造一座更标准的桥了。’”</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">22 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Theo works days, nights, and weekends in the tulip fields in the Netherlands and never <strong>complains</strong> of <strong>sore</strong> muscles.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>Theo is an artificial intelligence, or AI, robot that looks for diseased flowers each spring.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Theo the robot walks with his namesake checking Dutch tulip fields for sick flowers in Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands, Tuesday, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/e3d93c9a-7c98-4a7a-b3f8-90d67b396fe9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Theo the robot walks with his namesake checking Dutch tulip fields for sick flowers in Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands, Tuesday, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)</span></div>
<p>The work prevents viruses from spreading among the valuable plants. The robot looks for troubled tulip bulbs and destroys them if necessary. They are removed from the healthy ones in a processing center after the harvest.</p>
<p>There are 45 robots like Theo working in the tulip fields of the Netherlands. Their job becomes important as the winter turns to spring and <strong>peak</strong> season nears. People come from around the world to see the colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Allan Visser's family has been growing tulips for three generations. This is the second season that he has used a robot. He said it is very costly – the same as a sports car – about $200,000. In the past, knowledgeable farmers would walk the fields looking for tulips that showed signs of sickness.</p>
<p>"I prefer to have the robot because a sports car doesn't take out the sick tulips from our field," he said. "Yeah, it is <strong>expensive</strong>, but there are less and less people who can really see the sick tulips."</p>
<p>The robot has been trained to see the sick plants. Red <strong>stripes</strong> show up on the leaves of infected plants. The robots roll through the fields very slowly – about one kilometer per hour – looking for sick tulips.</p>
<p>Visser called the work "<strong>precision</strong> agriculture" as he explained how the robots work. He said the robots have cameras and take thousands of photos of the tulips. The AI software considers the photos and decides which tulips need to be killed.</p>
<p>"The robot has learned to recognize this and treat it," Visser said.</p>
<p>H2L Robotics is the company that makes the robots. Erik de Jong is the managing director. He said the robots use <strong>GPS</strong> coordinates to be sure they are killing the correct tulip among many tulips in the field.</p>
<p>He said all of the knowledge they use in the computer program that informs the robot comes from tulip farmers—farmers like Theo van der Voort. He is the farmer that the robot is named after.</p>
<p>Van der Voort retired after 52 years of looking for sick flowers in his fields.</p>
<p>"It's <strong>fantastic</strong>," he said. "It sees just as much as I see."</p>

            <title>Female Presidential Candidate Brings Hope in Senegal  (2024/3/23)</title>

<p>Senegal's only female presidential candidate may have little chance of winning Sunday's election, but activists say her presence alone is important. They argue that the candidacy of Anta Babacar Ngom is helping create gender equality in the West African nation.</p>
<p>Ngom is a 40-year-old business executive who runs her family's food company. She has made the economy a center of her campaign. Economic difficulty has driven thousands of Senegalese on sometimes dangerous travel in search of a better life outside Africa.</p>
<p>Ngom appears to be a voice for both women and young people - groups hard hit by unemployment and rising prices. She has promised to create millions of jobs and a bank for women. She says such actions will help women gain economic independence.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Presidential candidate Anta Babacar Ngom greets supporters during her electoral campaign caravan in Dakar, Senegal, Monday, March 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Sylvain Cherkaoui)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-85b5-08dc499ec5ef_cx7_cy4_cw85_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Presidential candidate Anta Babacar Ngom greets supporters during her electoral campaign caravan in Dakar, Senegal, Monday, March 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Sylvain Cherkaoui)</span></div>
<p>She told The Associated Press, "The young girls I meet ask for my support. They do so because they know that when a woman comes to power, she will put an end to their suffering. I'm not going to forget them."</p>
<p>Ngom is the first female candidate to run for president in over 10 years. Few expect her to win. But activists say her candidacy demonstrates how women are moving ahead in the struggle for equality.</p>
<p>"We have to be there, even if we don't stand a chance," said Selly Ba, an activist and sociologist. "We don't stand a chance in these elections. But it's important that we have women candidates, women who are in the race."</p>
<p>Senegal had its first female prime minister in 2001. And in 2010, a law that required all political parties to introduce gender parity in elections helped increase female involvement in politics.</p>
<p>"Women's rights have <strong>evolved</strong> at the political level over the last 10 years and particularly since the gender<strong> parity</strong> law came into force," said Bousso Sambe, a former parliamentarian.</p>
<p>In 2012, two women ran for president, and while they earned less than one percent of the vote each, experts say their participation was important. Women in Senegal now make up more than 40 percent of parliament, one of the highest levels of representation in Africa.</p>
<p>Ngom told the AP, "Women must be able to express themselves without <strong>hindrance</strong>, while <strong>preserving</strong> our cultural identity and valuing the traditional values that have shaped our society."</p>
<p>Ngom's supporters say they are proud to back a female candidate and hopeful for a change in the next government.</p>
<p>"Our children are dying at sea because of unemployment and job insecurity," activist Aicha Ba said at a recent demonstration.</p>
<p>She added: "Women are tired."</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Lola.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3e2f-08dc483d48ff_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>I'm Lola from Madrid.</p>
<p>My question is about the pronunciation of the word "live". Sometimes the pronunciation is "liv" and others "laiv." The same with the word "lives." Why?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Lola. This is such a good question!</p>
<p>"Live" is an example of a heteronym, or words that have the same <strong>spelling</strong> but different <strong>pronunciations</strong> and meanings.</p>
<p>There are nearly 100 heteronyms in English. But let's get to your question about the word spelled l-i-v-e today.</p>
<p>It can be either an adjective, an adverb, or a verb.</p>
<p>When it is used as an adjective or adverb, we use the /a<i></i>618;/ sound, like "laiv."</p>
<p><em>I love <u>live</u> music.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you watching the game <u>live</u>?</em></p>
<p>When it is used as a verb, we use the /<i></i>618;/ sound, like "liv."</p>
<p><em>Where do you <u>live</u>?</em></p>
<p><em>We <u>live</u> just outside the city.</em></p>
<p>As for the word spelled l-i-v-e-s, it can be either a plural noun (from the singular "life") or third person singular verb.</p>
<p>When it is a plural noun, we use the /a<i></i>618;/ sound:</p>
<p><em>Cats have nine <u>lives</u>.</em></p>
<p>When it is used as third person singular, we use the /<i></i>618;/ sound.</p>
<p><em>She <u>lives</u> with her mother</em>.</p>
<p>So, in order to know which pronunciation to use for l-i-v-e and -s, you want to look carefully at how it is used in a sentence.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Lola.</p>
<p>Do you have a question about American English? Send us an email at learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>

<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The American college basketball tournaments known as "March Madness" begin this week. College basketball, or National Collegiate Athletic Association (N.C.A.A.) basketball, is very popular in the United States. In parts of the country it is even more popular than professional basketball.</p>
<p>And, many people like to try to guess who will win the many games played over the next few weeks of competition. Sixty-seven games will be held for both men and women.</p>
<p>A <strong>chart </strong>that shows the <strong>sequence</strong> of games is called a bracket. Thousands of fans in the U.S. compete with each other to correctly predict the most outcomes of each game.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pittsburgh guard Ishmael Leggett, right, places a decal on the bracket after an NCAA college basketball game on March 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-79b6-08dc49ba9e8d_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pittsburgh guard Ishmael Leggett, right, places a decal on the bracket after an NCAA college basketball game on March 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)</span></div>
<p>Today, more people are using artificial intelligence, or AI, to help them fill their brackets. Using AI for bracketing in the tournament is not so new. Even so, the yearly bracket competitions still provide many surprises for computer science experts who have spent years creating their models using past tournament results.</p>
<p>The researchers have found that machine learning alone cannot quite solve for the limited data and unpredictable human elements of the tournament.</p>
<p>A normal fan may spend a few days this week deciding which team might win a few games in the tournament. But some computer experts are going after even more detailed information. They are using complex math to find the best model for predicting success in the tournament. Some are using AI to perfect their codes or decide which qualities of the team can best predict their competitive future.</p>
<p>The chances of creating a perfect bracket are extremely low for any competitor, however <strong>advanced</strong> their tools may be. An "informed fan" making choices based on past results has a 1 in 2 billion chance at perfection, says Ezra Miller. He is a mathematics professor at Duke University.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is likely very good at determining the <strong>probability</strong> that a team wins, Miller said. But even with the models, he added that the "<strong>random</strong> choice of who's going to win a game that's evenly matched" is still a random choice.</p>
<p>For the 10th straight year, the data science community Kaggle is hosting "Machine Learning Madness." In traditional bracket competitions, people simply write each team they think will win. But "Machine Learning Madness" requires users to enter a percentage representing their level of confidence that a team will advance.</p>
<p>Kaggle provides a large data set from past results for people to develop their <strong>algorithms</strong>. That includes information on a team's free-throw percentage, <strong>turnovers </strong>and assists. Users can then turn that information over to an algorithm to find the statistics most predictive of tournament success.</p>
<p>"It's a fair fight. There's people who know a lot about basketball and can use what they know," said Jeff Sonas. He is a statistical chess analyst who helped found the competition. "It is also possible for someone who doesn't know a lot about basketball but is good at learning how to use data to make predictions."</p>
<p>No method will include every element at play on the court. There is a balance between modeling and <strong>intuition</strong>, said Tim Chartier, a Davidson University bracket expert.</p>
<p>Chartier has studied brackets since 2009. He developed a method that largely depends on team success on home court and away, performance in the second half of the season and difficulty of <strong>schedule</strong>. But he said the NCAA Tournament's historical results provide an unpredictable and small<strong> sample</strong> size. That is a difficulty for machine learning models, which use large sample sizes.</p>
<p>Chartier's goal is never for his students to reach perfection in their brackets. His own model still cannot account for Davidson's 2008 unexpected admission into the "Elite Eight" level of the tournament.</p>
<p>In that mystery, Chartier finds a useful reminder from March Madness: "The beauty of sports, and the beauty of life itself, is the randomness that we can't predict."</p>

<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>India will begin the world's largest general election next month.</p>
<p>The process is expected to stretch over 44 days before results are announced on June 4. Nearly 970 million Indians – more than 10 percent of the world population – will be <strong>eligible</strong> to take part.</p>
<p>The voting process will choose 543 lawmakers to India's lower house of Parliament. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term in office. He will face off against an alliance of opposition parties struggling to unseat him. Most public opinion studies predict Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party will win.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Indian election officials and paramilitary soldiers with election materials walk along the river Brahmaputra to board on a country boat on the eve of the first phase of general election in Majuli, Assam, India.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath, File)</span></div>
<p>Here are some of the main facts to know about the election.</p>
<p><strong>Why will the election take so long?</strong></p>
<p>There are two main reasons the election will stretch on so long. One is that India is the world's most populous country. The other reason, experts say, is because it will be a huge <strong>logistical</strong> effort to make sure that every registered voter can take part in the process.</p>
<p>The voting process will take place over seven parts, or stages. The country's 28 states and eight federal territories will vote at different times. Each stage will last one day, with the first held on April 19 and the last held on June 1.</p>
<p>Voters in some states will <strong>cast</strong> their ballots over a day, while in other places it may take longer. Uttar Pradesh, the largest state with 200 million people, will vote over a period of seven days, for example.</p>
<p>During the election, voting stations will be set up in <strong>remote</strong> places. This will include a wildlife refuge in southern Kerala state and another in a shipping container in western Gujarat state.</p>
<p><strong>How is security a concern?</strong></p>
<p>Experts say one main reason for the multi-stage election is to improve security.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of federal security forces will be deployed during the voting. The guards, including those who usually guard borders, will be sent along with state police to prevent violence and to transport electoral officials and voting machines.</p>
<p>Deadly clashes involving supporters of competing political parties harmed past elections. But such violence has eased over the years, thanks to heavy security.</p>
<p>The Indian government's elections chief, Rajiv Kumar, said recently, "Look at the geography of the country ... there are rivers, mountains, snow, jungles ... think of the security forces' movements. They will have to travel through the length and breadth of the country."</p>
<p>Kumar added, "We will <strong>walk the extra mile</strong> so voters don't have to."</p>

            <title>In South America’s ‘Lithium Triangle,’ a Struggle Between Tradition, Industry  (2024/3/22)</title>

<span class="byline">By Mario Ritter, Jr</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>An area stretching across Argentina, Bolivia and Chile forms what is called the "Lithium Triangle." The earth there is rich in lithium, a necessary metal in creating <strong>batteries</strong> for electric cars and other products.</p>
<p>The international effort to develop technologies that do not use oil, gas or coal requires huge amounts of lithium. But small native communities in the Lithium Triangle are worried. They fear their way of life will disappear as industry pushes for new lithium mines. The mining takes place in low, dry areas known as "salt flats."</p>
<p><strong>Stories from Argentina</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The town of Tusaquillas, in the northern Argentine province of Jujuy, sits near the Guayatayoc salt lagoon, background, on April 24, 2023.

<p>Irene Leonor Flores de Callata is 68 years old. She lives in a desert area of Argentina where she keeps llamas and sheep. The life includes searching for fresh water on a usual basis.</p>
<p>Her town is one of 38 that surround salt flats called the Guayatoyoc Lagoon and Salinas Grandes. People in the area earn some money from vacationing visitors and salt harvesting. They are a native people known as the Kolla.</p>
<p>Flores de Callata worries that if the mining expands in her area, there will be no water. She said: "What will we do if we don't have water? If the mines come, we'll lose our culture, we won't be left with anything."</p>
<p><strong>Lithium's value</strong></p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2023, the price for one ton of lithium almost tripled in the U.S., reaching $46,000. In China, a main buyer of lithium reportedly paid $76,000 for one ton of the metal last year. Some call the metal "white gold."</p>
<p>Mining companies around the world are turning their attention to the Lithium Triangle. World leaders are also pushing for lithium production. In the United States, President Joe Biden said he aimed to have electric vehicles make up half of all sales in America by 2030. That would amount to about 8 million electric vehicles. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said: "Argentina is <strong>poised</strong> to play a critical role in building supply <strong>chains</strong> for critical minerals that will drive the economy of the 21st century, particularly things like lithium."</p>
<p>Although prices have recently dropped because of oversupply, experts say worldwide demand is likely to rise in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental concerns in Chile</strong></p>
<p>Two lithium mining companies operate in Chile, which borders Argentina to the west. SQM is a Chilean business and Albermarle is an American one. Valentín Barrera, a spokesman for SQM, said lithium is an answer to the problem climate change. "We want to grow, understanding that it's needed to <strong>mitigate</strong> climate change."</p>
<p>In Chile, SQM pumps thousands of liters of salt water out of the ground and then lets the water dry out in <strong>pools</strong>. The solids in the salty water contain lithium. The pools <strong>evaporate,</strong> leaving a solid substance that is collected and purified.</p>
<p>Environmentalists, however, are concerned that the mining in the area will harm animals like flamingos and other life. As in Argentina, mining has brought criticism and legal cases. Local people want influence in decisions about the land.</p>
<p>In 2016, an investigation of SQM found that the company had used more water in their mining process than the law permitted. Later, the company was ordered to pay $51 million to mitigate damage caused by six incidents, including the polluting of fresh water wells.</p>
<p>Barrera said the court actions and criticism come from "disinformation." He blamed the state-run copper mines, which also use a lot of water.</p>
<p>An Albermarle spokesperson said the underground salt water "is not water" because it is not drinkable.</p>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) spoke to a number of scientists. They said it is hard to believe that industrial water use does not affect the environment. They said water pumping can pollute fresh water with salty water and dry out the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Ingrid Garcés studies water at Chile's University of Antofagasta. She said the salt flats are important for different kinds of animal and plant life. She said the water in the salt flats is not drinkable but is connected to other water sources and is important to natives.</p>
<p>A 2020 report from the United Nations said that mining has used up 65 percent of the water in Chile's Atacama Salt Flat causing pollution and environmental damage, causing natives to leave "ancestral settlements."</p>
<p>In April of 2023, Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced a plan to increase government control of lithium mines. The government told the AP the plan would help control water use and spread wealth to more people. The move had the effect of pushing mining companies to invest in neighboring Argentina.</p>
<p><strong>An opportunity and contradiction</strong></p>
<p>Miguel Soler is secretary of mining in northern Argentina. He said, "In Argentina, (Chile's decision) is an <strong>opportunity</strong>."</p>
<p>More than 30 companies are officially seeking permission to mine in the Guayatoyoc Lagoon and Salinas Grandes areas in Argentina. Local people are opposing the business effort.</p>
<p>The llama herder Flores de Callata and her native Kolla people have fought against mining and brought long legal battles to halt projects in the past also.</p>
<p>"We are guardians of the highlands," said Flores de Callata, "We defend our land..."</p>
<p>Last summer, the local government changed laws to limit the ability of groups to protest against the expansion of mining. Alicia Chalabe, an environmental lawyer representing the communities, said the change to local law violates international law. She said there is a lot of "pressure to <strong>exploit</strong> lithium for electric vehicles." But she added, while lithium is important worldwide, "so is the resistance of these communities. They're not alone."</p>
<p>Flores de Callata lives in the small town of Tusaquillas next to the wide salt flats where mining might take place in the future. She has a small group of farm animals and lives in a home with dried mud walls that she and her husband built. She wonders what will be left in 20 years.</p>
<p>"If the mines come, we'll have money for a time. But then our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren—they're the ones who will suffer," she said.</p>
<p>Generations of Ramon Torres' family herded goats near a town close to Chile's Atacama Salt Flats. But when companies started mining lithium in the early 1980s, Torres took a job as a miner and started saving money.</p>
<p>Today, he uses his wireless phone as he sits next to his small home. He bought the house and his device with his earnings from mining.</p>
<p>"There is development, but there's also the water issue. And they <strong>contradict</strong> each other," Torres said. "Because everyone needs money, everyone also needs the basics, like healthcare and education."</p>

            <title>Talking about Your Dreams  (2024/3/22)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>In an earlier <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we talked about "Fast Car," a song about young people who had dreams of making their lives better. Then, we asked our readers and listeners to tell us about their own dreams.</p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will review two answers we received, both from people in their middle years of life, and we give some grammar advice.</p>
<p><strong>Jairo's dream</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-dc69-08dc48330aaa_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>First, we want to thank Jairo, a middle-aged man who wrote to us. He said,</p>
<p><em>"Today everyday grammar topic is about dreams, how can I describe my dream? This is an interesting topic over all for people who already has <strong>certain</strong> age, like me; as well, the time is not longer for following an eternal dream..."</em></p>
<p>Jairo used an interesting expression to tell us about his age. He said, "people who already has certain age." You might have heard this expression in sentences like:</p>
<p><em>A person of a certain age needs to be concerned about retirement funds.</em></p>
<p>Note that the verb "has" is not used, but the preposition "of" is used before "a certain age." As you can guess, this is a <strong>polite</strong> way to describe someone in their 40s, 50s, or 60s. It is often used to talk about women's age without saying how old they are. Sometimes it comes before criticism, so take care in using it.</p>
<p><strong>Time is growing shorter</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Jairo said, "the time is not longer for following an eternal dream." We suggest using, "the time is growing shorter" or "there is little time left." Jairo could say,</p>
<p><em>The time for me to follow my dream is growing shorter.</em></p>
<p>Jairo continues to tell us about what is now important to meeting his life goals.</p>
<p><em>"... for that reason I need to be focus on important things, indeed, buy a house, save money for my daughter's scholarship, save money for taking a vacations or save money to be prepare for my retirement time..."</em></p>
<p>In this statement, Jairo uses "be" before an infinitive verb form two times: "be focus" and "be prepare." We suggest using the adjective form in both:</p>
<p><em>I need to <u>be focused</u> on important things.</em></p>
<p><em>I need to save money to <u>be prepared</u> for my retirement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kaori's dreams</strong><br/>
Next, we review a message from Kaori, who is a middle-aged woman in Japan. She begins by saying what she dreamed as a young person, using the expression we heard in the song, "Fast Car" – "to be someone."</p>
<p><em>"When I was young, I strongly believed I would be someone in the future. I wanted to be the first female Prime Minister in Japan or an executive of the big famous company."</em></p>
<p>Kaori did earn a job at a company, but then marriage and children and culture forced her to quit working. She says:</p>
<p><em>"However, I didn't become anyone...I stopped my job and gave up my carrier. Do I regret my decision and my life? No. Not at all.</em></p>
<p>From the remaining part of Kaori's message, we find she was a success at being a mother, as her two daughters are in college. And she gained a part-time job that helped to pay their school costs when they were younger. The corrections to her message that we suggest are the spelling of "career" and how to say you have quit a job. We can say, "I stopped working," or "I quit working." But Kaori could also say, "I changed jobs," because being a homemaker and mother, although unpaid, is a full-time job. Kaori did all that while holding a part-time job.</p>
<p>Thinking of how her dream changed over time, Kaori writes:</p>
<p><em>My past dreams were only thinking, not real. I can say my own dreams have changed everytime. In the future, even if I become old, I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams at anytime.</em></p>
<p>Two words in this part cause grammatical issues: "everytime" and "anytime." "Every time" should be written as two separate words, but a better way to say this would be:</p>
<p>I can say my own dreams have changed over the years.</p>
<p>"Anytime" is an adverb, so it should not appear after the preposition "at." Instead, Kaori could say,</p>
<p><em>I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams anytime.</em></p>
<p>Or she could use a different expression:<em> </em></p>
<p><em>I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams my whole life long.</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Kaori and Jairo, for writing to us and helping everyone to learn more about how we talk about our dreams. You both showed us that dreams can change over time as our lives become connected with those of others.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>!</p>

            <title>US Libraries Struggle to Pay for Costly Digital Books  (2024/3/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A growing number of American <strong>libraries</strong> are struggling to offer users digital versions of books because they cost a lot more than physical copies.</p>
<p>Public demand for digital materials – including books called e-books as well as audiobooks – has been rising at U.S. libraries since the COVID-19 pandemic. But libraries have had difficulties meeting demand. This has forced many librarians to put users on waiting lists to borrow digital materials.</p>
<p>Associated Press (AP) reporters recently spoke with library officials about the problem. One library they visited was in the community of West Haven, Connecticut. There, library workers noted big cost differences between physical and digital books.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman stands among the bookshelves in the main reading room of The New York Public Library, December 14, 2004. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5a63-08dc48ee0be8_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman stands among the bookshelves in the main reading room of The New York Public Library, December 14, 2004. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)</span></div>
<p>Most libraries are currently not permitted to buy e-books for a set price like individuals who purchase them online. This is because libraries offer the books to many people to borrow.</p>
<p>One example is a work by bestselling writer Robin Cook. A physical, hard copy version of Cook's latest book costs the West Haven Library $18 to buy, the AP reports. But the cost of <strong>leasing</strong> a digital copy of the same book costs the library $55.</p>
<p>Library officials told the AP lease prices are set by book publishers and generally cannot be re-negotiated. Such leasing agreements end after a limited time. Usually this means the lease lasts for up to two years or until it has been borrowed a set number of times. The cost of the leases is putting financial pressure on libraries.</p>
<p>Officials at West Haven Library told the AP they do not have a large budget. But they said they had to spend more than $12,000 over the past three years to lease 276 additional digital books that were not available within a larger library network.</p>
<p>The officials said 84 of those books were no longer available. And they noted that if the same $12,000 had been spent on paper books, the amount would have paid for about 800 copies.</p>
<p>"Imagine if a playground was built at a school with tax dollars, only to be taken down after two years of use," librarian Colleen Bailie said at a recent public hearing on the issue.</p>
<p>Publishers say their agreements with libraries are fair. They say that, while libraries pay a higher lease rate, they can make the books available to many users over time.</p>
<p>Librarians in several states have been pushing for legislation to reduce high costs and restrictions on digital materials. This year, lawmakers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Hawaii and New Hampshire all proposed bills aimed at lowering costs.</p>
<p>But the measures have faced strong opposition from the publishing industry. The industry argues the proposals do not effectively respect <strong>intellectual property</strong> owned by copyright holders and would harm the publishing businesses.</p>
<p>Libraries Online Inc. is a digitally connected library group operating in Connecticut. The organization says it currently spends about $20,000 a month on e-books for its 38 members. The cost of renewing <strong>expired</strong> e-books takes about 20 percent of the group's budget, e-book committee chair Rebecca Harlow told the AP.</p>
<p>"If we replaced all of the content that has expired this year, the cost would <strong>exceed</strong> our entire annual budget for e-books," Harlow recently told lawmakers. "We have completely lost the ability to build a library collection," she added.</p>
<p>In Illinois, a legislative proposal would cancel contracts between libraries and publishers that include certain rules. These include restricting a library's right to decide loan periods for <strong>licensed</strong> electronic material. Massachusetts and Connecticut are considering similar proposals.</p>
<p>Last year, groups representing publishers, booksellers and writers formed a group – the Protect the Creative Economy Coalition – to oppose state measures.</p>
<p>But Julie Holden, assistant library director for the Cranston Public Library in Rhode Island, said she thinks legislative action is needed. Otherwise, local librarians will continue to face financial pressure and will need to keep examining long lists of expiring digital leases to decide which ones can be replaced.</p>
<p>Holden added, "Taxpayers who fund our public libraries <strong>deserve</strong> better. Way better."</p>

            <title>Marriages in South Korea Rise Slightly after Years of Decrease  (2024/3/21) | 韩国结婚率去年小幅增长</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202403/marriages-in-south-korea-rise-slightly-after-years-of-decrease.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The number of marriages in South Korea rose in 2023 for the first time in more than ten years.<br/>
2023年韩国结婚人数出现十多年来的首次增长。</p>
<p>The increase came after the pandemic which forced some couples to delay marriage plans. But the data did not point to a continued increase in the aging country.<br/>
这一增长出现在疫情迫使一些夫妇推迟结婚计划之后。但该数据并未指向老龄化国家结婚率的持续增长。</p>
<p>The small rise in marriages last year comes as its fertility rate continued to decrease. South Korea's fertility rate, or the average number of children born per woman, is already the world's lowest. It is falling because women are concerned about their careers, the cost of raising children, or are deciding not to have babies.<br/>
去年韩国结婚率小幅上升之际，其生育率持续下降。韩国的生育率，即每个妇女平均生育的孩子数量，已经是全球最低。下降的原因是女性担心自己的职业、抚养孩子的成本，或者决定不生孩子。</p>
<p>Government data showed a total of 193,657 couples got married last year. That is up 1.0 percent from 191,690 a year earlier. It is the first increase since 2011.<br/>
韩国官方数据显示，去年共有193657对夫妇结婚。这比前年同期的191690对增长了1.0%。这是自2011年以来的首次增长。</p>
<p>That compares with a 0.4 percent drop in 2022. That was when South Korea started to ease restrictions on social gatherings put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restrictions saw the number of marriages decrease 9.8 percent in 2021 and 10.7 percent in 2020.<br/>
相比之下，2022年下降了0.4%。当时韩国开始放松新冠大流行期间对社交聚会的限制。这些限制见证了2021年和2020年的结婚人数分别减少了9.8%和10.7%。</p>
<p>The 2023 number of marriages, however, remains well below the 239,159 marriages seen in 2019. And that compares to a yearly number of more than 320,000 recorded 10 years earlier.<br/>
然而，2023年的结婚人数仍远低于2019年的239159人。相比之下，10年前录得的年度数据超过32万。</p>
<p>A government official said that couples delaying marriage was a reason for more marriages in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023.<br/>
一位政府官员表示，推迟结婚是2022年下半年和2023年上半年结婚人数增长的原因之一。</p>
<p>"In the second half of 2023, however, marriages fell year-on-year, indicating that people who had been delaying marriage due to COVID-19 have now mostly got married," the official told reporters.<br/>
这位官员告诉记者：“然而，2023年下半年，结婚人数同比下降，这表明因新冠肺炎而推迟结婚的人现在大多结婚了。”</p>
<p>The 2023 increase was also well below the increases seen in nearby China. Marriages in China rose 12.4 percent last year. That happened as more couples got married after delays caused by the pandemic.<br/>
韩国2023年的增幅也远低于近邻中国的增幅。去年，中国的结婚人数增长了12.4%。随着越来越多因疫情推迟的夫妇结婚，这种情况发生了。</p>
<p>Most South Koreans say high housing costs are the biggest reason for getting married. Many also see marriage as the first step before having a baby in the Asian country.<br/>
大多数韩国人表示，高昂的房价是他们结婚的最大原因。在这个亚洲国家，许多人还将结婚视为生孩子前的第一步。</p>
<p>The Yonhap news agency reported a recent study of 500 South Koreans aged between 19 and 23. It showed that 50.4 percent of those asked did not plan on getting married or having children.<br/>
韩联社报道了最近一项针对500名年龄在19岁至23岁之间的韩国人的研究。调查显示，50.4%的受访者没有结婚或生孩子的打算。</p>
<p>The government says it will take "extraordinary measure" to deal the low birth rate. Political parties are promising public housing and easier loans for young South Koreans ahead of the April legislative election.<br/>
政府表示将采取“非常措施”应对低出生率问题。各政党承诺在4月国会选举之前为韩国年轻人提供公共住房和更容易的贷款。</p>
<p>Marriages with a foreign national greatly increased for a second year, increasing 18.3 percent to 19,717.<br/>
涉外婚姻连续第二年大幅增长，去年增长了18.3%到19717对。</p>

<p>Aid groups warn that famine, a widespread lack of food, will soon strike two troubled places: Gaza and Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>In Gaza</strong></p>
<p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an organization that follows hunger worldwide.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Palestinians line up to receive free meals at Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip on Monday, March 18, 2024.

<p>On Monday, the group warned that more than one million Gazans could face famine if Israel expands its offensive in the southern city of Rafah. About half of the territory's people are crowded into the city. The report says almost all of them are struggling to get enough food already.</p>
<p>"This is the largest number of people facing <strong>imminent</strong> famine in the world today, and it has only taken five months to <strong>occur</strong>," said Matthew Hollingworth, the acting World Food Program country director for the Israeli-occupied territories.</p>
<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the expected famine "entirely manmade," adding, "starvation is used as a weapon of war."</p>
<p>Aid groups say that international efforts to ship food by air and sea are too small and too few. The IPC reported that famine could happen in Gaza any time between now and May if fighting does not stop.</p>
<p><strong>In Haiti</strong></p>
<p>In Haiti, four million people need help with food and about 1.4 million others are on the edge of famine, reports the United Nations World Food Program.</p>
<p>Aids organizations compared the situation in Haiti to a war <strong>zone</strong>. Criminal groups, or gangs, control many parts of the country and prevent aid from reaching its people.</p>
<p>Only a few aid organizations have been able to restart operations shut down since February 29. That is when gangs began to attack. They burned police stations, shut down airports and raided prisons, freeing more than 4,000 prisoners.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks later, Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced that he would resign from office.</p>
<p>Haitian citizen Erigeunes Jeffrand spoke to the Associated Press about the conditions in his country. He said he used to make a living selling sugar but the recent gang activity ended that. Criminals forced Jeffrand and his four children to flee their neighborhood.</p>
<p>"My home was completely destroyed and robbed," he said. "They took everything I have. And now, they're not even letting me work."</p>
<p>Jean-Martin Bauer is the Haiti director for the World Food Program. He said last week, "We have supplies for weeks. I'm saying weeks, not months." Bauer added, "That has me terrified."</p>
<p><strong>What is famine?</strong></p>
<p>The IPC was developed in 2004 during the famine in Somalia. Worldwide, the group says nearly 158 million people face crisis hunger situations or worse.</p>
<p>The group says famine is when an entire population or a sub-group of a population is without food, possibly causing death in the short term.</p>
<p>In famine, 20 percent of households would have an extreme lack of food, 30 percent of children would suffer from severe malnutrition and at least two adults or four children per every 10,000 people would die each day because of starvation, malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p>While the depth of the food crises in Haiti and Gaza is new, the underlying conditions are not, said Tobias Stillman, a director of the aid group Action Against Hunger, via email.</p>
<p>Even before the war, 80 percent of Gazans depended on humanitarian aid and about half of all households did not have enough food, he said. In Haiti, millions were already dealing with emergency levels of hunger and crisis levels of food need.</p>
<p>Death from starvation can come "surprisingly quickly," Stillman said. Without food, the body uses carbohydrates and fats first. When those are gone, muscle and organs begin to break down. Body systems, including <strong>digestion</strong>, start shutting down, which makes it harder to take in nutrients. Many times, people without food die of common infections. If that does not happen, organs shut down and the heart stops.</p>
<p>Children younger than five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, old people and people with underlying health problems are most at risk.</p>

            <title>Taliban May Never Reopen Girls’ Secondary Schools  (2024/3/21)</title>

<p>An Afghan education official says the ruling Taliban group might permanently close girls' secondary schools. The official said the Taliban is instead supporting religious schools known as madrasas.</p>
<p>The Taliban shut down girls' secondary schools in 2022. The group gave "religious and cultural" concerns as the reasons.</p>
<p>Taliban officials defend the ban. They say they are working to create a correct educational environment for older female students.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The benches of a school sit empty in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f802-08dc479b32e5_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The benches of a school sit empty in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022.

<p>"Schools may never be reopened the way they were under the occupation," an official at Afghanistan's Education Ministry told VOA. The official was referring to 2001 to 2021, when the U.S. military was in the country.</p>
<p>The official said there is no major difference between a traditional school and a madrasa. The official did not wish to be named because the Taliban have banned its members from speaking to VOA. The official added that madrasas serve the purpose of education just as well as traditional schools.</p>
<p>However, the United Nations and human rights workers worry that madrasas cannot fully replace traditional schools. They say madrasas deal too much with religious studies and do not teach enough subjects.</p>
<p><strong>U.N. concerns about madrassas</strong></p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed this worry in a report to the U.N. Security Council this month. He said the madrasas do not prepare boys or girls well enough for higher education and professional training. Students need "higher-level" education and training "to join an effective workforce in the future," he added.</p>
<p>The U.N. reports there are over 7,000 registered madrasas in Afghanistan with about 380 for girls. Taliban officials have said there are no age limits for girls attending the religious schools.</p>
<p>In his report, Guterres noted that employing new teachers for madrasas has continued. In July 2023, the leader of the Taliban ordered the hiring of 100,000 new madrasa teachers by the end of last year, the report said.</p>
<p>Pashtana Dorani is a U.S.-based Afghan women's education activist. She said the Taliban has already replaced traditional schools with religious ones. "They have created their own system," Dorani told VOA.</p>
<p>In addition to closing secondary schools for girls, the Taliban has banned women from most jobs. The group also does not permit women entry to some public places like parks and sport centers.</p>
<p>Last year, the all-male Taliban cabinet banned women's <strong>beauty parlors</strong>. Taliban officials say their rules agree with what Afghans want for the future.</p>
<p>Last year, education ended for more than 330,000 Afghan girls as they passed grade six exams. Aid agencies said they joined more than 3.7 million girls who are banned from secondary schooling.</p>
<p>Experts worry about the long-term effects of the Taliban's education policies. Afghanistan has one of the highest levels of maternal deaths during childbirth in the world. Experts warn that restricting education will lead to even worse public health problems.</p>
<p>The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, estimates keeping girls out of schools causes $500 million in economic losses for Afghanistan each year.</p>
<p>The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until October 2001. After 20 years of war, they returned to power in August 2021.</p>

<p>March 20 is the United Nations' International Day of Happiness.</p>
<p>For many years, northern European countries, especially Finland, have been named among the happiest countries on Earth. The United States has never made it into the top 10.</p>
<p>But California state lawmaker Anthony Rendon is hoping he can do something about happiness in the most populous American state.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Assemblyman Anthony Rendon walks with his daughter Vienna before being sworn in as Speaker of the Assembly during the opening session of the California Legislature in Sacramento, Calif., Monday, Dec. 5, 2022. (AP Photo/Jos&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;233; Luis Villegas, Pool,File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5184-08dc47713686_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Assemblyman Anthony Rendon walks with his daughter Vienna before being sworn in as Speaker of the Assembly during the opening session of the California Legislature in Sacramento, Calif., Monday, Dec. 5, 2022. (AP Photo/Jos<i>&amp;#</i>233; Luis Villegas, Pool,File)</span></div>
<p>In his free time, Rendon likes to stay away from the workplace and spend time with his 4-year-old daughter at his home near Los Angeles. Recently, he took her ice skating and to an indoor play area. He said those are the "things that make me happy."</p>
<p>As one of the longest-serving leaders in the California legislature, Rendon is now trying to make happiness more central to policymaking in his last year in office. He created a first-in-the-nation group to study the issue of happiness. The group is called the Select Committee on Happiness and Public Policy Outcomes.</p>
<p>Rendon said it would be "silly" for lawmakers to not study how they can make people happier. "Because if we have everybody clothed, everybody housed, everybody has a job and they're <strong>miserable</strong>, then we've failed at what we're trying to do," he said.</p>
<p>In California, three-quarters of adults say they are "very happy" or "pretty happy." Twenty-six percent say they are "not too happy." The numbers come from a September 2023 study by the Public Policy Institute of California. The study also says Californians without a post-high school degree and those who earn less money are generally less happy than those with more education and more money.</p>
<p>The idea of considering happiness in public policy is not new.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation of Bhutan sets happiness as a goal of its public policy. The country asks its people about their level of happiness for what is called the Gross National Happiness Index. Officials then work to increase happiness by providing citizens with free health care and education. They also work to protect things like cultural traditions and the country's forests.</p>
<p>Phuntsho Norbu is consul general of Bhutan to the United States. Norbu said the government cannot make every person happy. But he said the government should "create the right conditions" to help people find happiness.</p>
<p>In California, lawmakers recently heard from experts about the things that make people happy and how public officials can support people's happiness.</p>
<p>Meliksah Demir is a professor of happiness at California State University, Sacramento. Demir said research shows that <strong>leisure</strong> activities, social relationships and life situations affect a person's happiness. He added that public officials can help by investing in mental health resources, adding green spaces and teaching about the value of happiness early on in schools.</p>
<p>Rendon said California is behind many parts of the world in looking at happiness in policymaking. He said he wanted to create the happiness committee after seeing a yearly report on happiness by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Last year's happiness report said that the way people <strong>view</strong> the effectiveness of government can influence their happiness. The United States was 15th in the world happiness <strong>ranking</strong> based on a three-year average from 2020 to 2022. Scandinavian countries, including Finland and Iceland, ranked the highest.</p>
<p>Kristina Bas Hamilton is a long-time labor supporter in California. "Government's role is to provide for its people," Bas Hamilton said. "The goal is to have happy citizens. That's the goal of all public policy."</p>

<p>A nonprofit group has identified more than 1,500 books that local schools in America have banned from their libraries and classrooms in 2022-2023.</p>
<p>The free-speech activism group PEN America is based in New York City. The group said the number represented a 33 percent increase from the year before. The American Library Association (ALA) says that there were more attempts to ban books from schools last year than ever before.</p>
<p>Moms for Liberty is a parental rights group based in Florida. The group has supported efforts to bar certain books from school libraries around the country. Group co-founder Tiffany Justice told the television network NewsNation last year that many books in school libraries are not right for children or teenagers and are harmful.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Banned Books Week display is at the Mott Haven branch of the New York Public Library in the Bronx borough of New York City on Saturday, October 7, 2023. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3a2f-08dc482c897d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A Banned Books Week display is at the Mott Haven branch of the New York Public Library in the Bronx borough of New York City on Saturday, October 7, 2023. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)</span></div>
<p>"Public school children — K through 12 — do not have <strong>unfettered</strong> access to the internet at school, or movies, or music," Justice said. "But somehow these books with these horribly <strong>explicit</strong>, graphic content are finding their way onto bookshelves in public schools all over America."</p>
<p>Gay Ivey is a professor of literacy at University of North Carolina- Greensboro. She and her research partner Peter Johnston from the University of Albany have studied students' <strong>motivations</strong> to read. They also have studied how students react to reading young adult literature. Ivey said school boards and policymakers do not agree about the purpose of reading in school.</p>
<p>Ivey and Johnston said they found that reading books considered "<strong>disturbing</strong>" by students was <strong>beneficial</strong> for their learning and emotional development. The two said parents also noticed a growth in their children after they read the disturbing books.</p>
<p>In one of Ivey and Johnston's studies, they spent a year in a middle school in an eastern town. They asked eighth grade students in an English class to choose any book they wanted to read.</p>
<p>The teens read the books during class time. They were not under any pressure from teachers to finish the book or to produce any schoolwork about the book. The researchers later spoke to 71 of the students about their experiences reading the books they chose. They also spoke to their parents and teachers.</p>
<p>Many of the students chose to read books that deal with difficult subjects like depression, suicide, illegal drug use, or sexual <strong>exploitation</strong>. Some of the books students chose were ones that schools around the country have banned. These books included <em>Thirteen Reasons Why</em> by Jay Asher, <em>Identical</em> by Ellen Hopkins and <em>Sold</em> by Patricia McCormick.</p>
<p>Ivey told VOA that students are <strong>drawn to</strong> books that deal with troubling subjects. Instead of being harmed by such subjects, reading about <strong>fictional</strong> <strong>characters</strong> made them more <strong>empathetic</strong>, she said. Ivey said they also were more thoughtful about the characters' motivations and actions. The researchers found that reading made the students happier, and helped some heal from sadness or depression. The difficult nature of the books made the students more likely to discuss the subjects with teachers, parents and friends.</p>
<p>The students in the study read books "that kind of throw you <strong>off</strong>-<strong>kilter</strong> that make you want to talk to somebody else," Ivey said. "The social interaction around it was really important, including talking to parents and teachers."</p>
<p>The subjects covered in the books may make both kids and adults uncomfortable. But Ivey said she and Johnston "came to realize that what really matters is the meaning that the kids make out of the books, not adults' meanings that they make. Which are often times really <strong>off-base</strong>."</p>
<p>Ivey said reading texts with difficult and troubling subject matter makes students more involved readers and learners. Students are able to relate to characters facing difficult decisions and think about how they would react to a situation described in the book.</p>
<p>Ivey and Johnston interviewed one teacher who said books that dealt with drugs, sex, and other issues made it easier to discuss those subjects in class. Discussions about books, "made it a safe way to kind of get into these things," the teacher said.</p>
<p>Reading disturbing books also made students more likely to learn as a group, the researchers said.</p>
<p>With the troubling texts, sometimes it is "really necessary to grab everybody around you and put all heads around it and teach each other," Ivey said. "More and different kinds of learning happens in those situations."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Information from this year's IQAir World Air Quality Report shows only seven countries met the World Health Organization's (WHO) pollution recommendations in 2023.<br/>
今年发布的《IQAir世界空气质量报告》的信息显示，2023年，只有七个国家符合世界卫生组织的污染建议。</p>
<p>The report said the five countries with what it called the lowest air quality had particle levels at least nine times higher than what the WHO recommends.<br/>
该报告称，空气质量最差的5个国家的颗粒物水平至少是世界卫生组织建议的9倍。</p>
<p>Three South Asian countries – Bangladesh, Pakistan and India – had the world's lowest air quality, the report said.<br/>
报告称，孟加拉国、巴基斯坦和印度这三个南亚国家的空气质量是全球最差的。</p>
<p>The information comes from the Swiss company IQAir, which makes air quality-related products. The report used measurements from over 30,000 stations across 134 countries.<br/>
这些信息来自瑞士IQAir公司，该公司生产空气质量相关产品。该报告使用了来自134个国家的30000多个台站的测量数据。</p>
<p>IQAir uses the WHO standard of PM2.5 to measure the size of breathable pollutant particles in the air. The PM2.5 measurement means the particles are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. The diameter of human hair, for example, is about 30 times larger than a particle of 2.5 microns.<br/>
IQAir采用世界卫生组织的PM2.5标准来测量空气中可呼吸污染物颗粒的大小。PM2.5的测量意味着颗粒物的直径为2.5微米或更小。例如，人类头发的直径大约是2.5微米颗粒的30倍。</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the concentration of PM2.5 particles reached 79.9 micrograms per cubic meter in 2023. In Pakistan, the number was 73.7. The WHO recommends a reading of no more than five micrograms.<br/>
在孟加拉国，2023年PM2.5颗粒物浓度达到每立方米79.9微克。在巴基斯坦，这一数字为73.7微克。世界卫生组织建议读数不超过5微克。</p>
<p>Christi Chester Schroeder oversees air quality science for IQair. She said South Asia's geography influences its air quality. She warned about the future.<br/>
克里斯蒂·彻斯特·施罗德负责IQair的空气质量科学。她说，南亚的地理位置影响其空气质量。她对未来提出了警告。</p>
<p>"Because of the climate conditions and the geography...the pollution has nowhere to go," she said.<br/>
她说：“由于气候条件和地理位置,污染无处可去。”</p>
<p>She added that because of "agricultural practices, industry and population density...it really does look like it is going to get worse before it gets better."<br/>
她补充道，由于“农业活动、工业和人口密度，情况看起来确实会在好转之前变得更糟。”</p>
<p>India's level was 54.4, Tajikistan in Central Asia was 49.0 and Burkina Faso in West Africa was the fifth-most polluted nation at 46.6.<br/>
印度的PM2.5水平为54.4，中亚的塔吉克斯坦为49.0，西非的布基纳法索为46.6，是污染第五严重的国家。</p>
<p>The only countries that met the WHO pollution recommendations were Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius and New Zealand.<br/>
符合世界卫生组织污染建议的国家只有澳大利亚、爱沙尼亚、芬兰、格林纳达、冰岛、毛里求斯和新西兰。</p>
<p>Of the 134 countries and regions measured, 124 had higher levels than called for in the WHO pollution guidelines.<br/>
在测量的134个国家和地区中，有124个国家和区域的污染水平高于世界卫生组织污染指导标准的要求。</p>
<p>Both Bangladesh and India's air quality decreased in 2023. In 2022, India was eighth and Bangladesh was fifth.<br/>
2023年，孟加拉国和印度的空气质量都有所下降。2022年，印度排名第八，孟加拉国排名第五。</p>
<p>Firoz Khan is an air pollution expert at North South University in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He said 20 percent of the early deaths in the country are caused by air pollution. He said spending on pollution-related healthcare was equal to four to five percent of the nation's economy.<br/>
菲罗兹·汗是孟加拉国达卡市南北大学的空气污染专家。他说，该国20%的早期死亡是由空气污染引起的。他说，与污染相关的医疗保健支出相当于全国经济的4%到5%。</p>
<p>In India, New Delhi's measurement of 92.7 micrograms made it the most-polluted capital city.<br/>
在印度，新德里的测量值为92.7微克，是污染最严重的首都。</p>
<p>Three countries that were on the list in 2022 were removed in 2023 because of problems collecting information. They were Chad, Iran and Sudan. Chad was the world's most polluted country last year.<br/>
2022年上榜的三个国家在2023年因信息收集问题被删除。他们是乍得、伊朗和苏丹。乍得去年是世界上污染最严重的国家。</p>
<p>IQAir provides its report each year. But many countries do not have public air quality measurement systems. Christa Hasenkopf is the director of the Air Quality Life Index at the University of Chicago. She said that is a big problem, "considering the large potential benefits and relatively low cost."<br/>
IQAir每年都会提供报告。但许多国家没有公共空气质量测量系统。克里斯塔·哈森科普夫是芝加哥大学空气质量生命指数的主任。她说，“考虑到巨大的潜在效益和相对较低的成本，这是一个大问题。”</p>
<p>She suggested a global effort to make air quality information more available, "especially in places where the health burden of air pollution has been largest."<br/>
她建议全球努力提供更多的空气质量信息，“尤其是在空气污染对健康负担最大的地方。”</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This story is one of the winning entries from the "Teach Us about Ukraine" writing contest sponsored by VOA Learning English and GoGlobal.</em></p>
<p>My name is Olha Balukh, and I have been teaching English for 19 years in Vinnytsia, Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a small corner of Lyceum 20, a type of school comprising primary and secondary ones, in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, students, teachers and community members recently gathered as the aroma of food wafted through the air.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Woman makes a delicious Ukrainian national food, varenyky with raspberry.

<p>It was not just a usual school event. It was a celebration of varenyky, the beloved Ukrainian dumplings.</p>
<p>Varenyky is much more than a delicious Ukrainian dish. The food represents the heart and soul of a nation. It is a sign of hospitality, unity, and tradition, making it perfect for a school festival to bring people together.</p>
<p>Every year, schools across Ukraine come alive with the spirit of unity when different festivals are organized. This year, the festival in the Lyceum served several purposes. In addition to bringing the community together, it was organized to provide much-needed assistance to children in need and the brave men and women in the army.</p>
<p>Due to the war a lot of people, especially children, were forced to flee from the eastern parts of the country. They lost their parents and friends, houses and other belongings. So, they need both psychological and financial help.</p>
<p>In a perogy festival, students, parents, and teachers worked to prepare several kinds of foods, including dumplings. The school became a center of culinary creativity, with everyone working together to create the tastiest varenyky. The place of education became a colorful market decorated with pumpkins and snowball trees. Food and dumplings included many fillings, from classic potato and cheese to sweet fruit-filled varieties, salmon, ricotta, herring, and beans.</p>
<p>Beyond food, the perogy festival was also a beacon of hope for those who need it most.</p>
<p>Children, who are often the most vulnerable members of society, received support from this festival. Andriy Nazarenko (grade 5-D) moved to Vinnytsia from Bakhmut. This town is completely destroyed nowadays. He was excited to take part in the event.</p>
<p>"I did not expect to get such support from my new teachers and classmates. I am really touched," said the boy.</p>
<p>Money raised from the festival also went to soldiers who defend the nation and provide equipment and supplies for the Ukrainian military.</p>
<p>Through their involvement in the festival, students learned that they can make a difference in the world, no matter their age.</p>

            <title>Report: Thousands More Chemicals in Plastics than Estimated  (2024/3/19)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A recently released report from European scientists says there are 16,000 chemicals in plastic materials around the world.</p>
<p>The report said not enough is known about the safety of all those chemicals. They estimate that about 25 percent of these chemicals are possibly harmful to human health or the environment.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Research Council supported the creation of the report. It was released as officials are negotiating a United Nations treaty on plastic pollution. The U.N. estimates 400 million metric tons of plastic waste are produced every year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A soldier pauses while cleaning plastic and other debris on the shores of Montesinos beach, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic July 19, 2018. (REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/8a71acb2-da56-4651-83df-00e5008d89cf_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A soldier pauses while cleaning plastic and other debris on the shores of Montesinos beach, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic July 19, 2018.

<p>Jane Muncke helped write the report. She is with the Swiss nonprofit Food Packaging Forum. She said to deal with plastic pollution, people must look at the "full <strong>life cycle</strong> of plastics."</p>
<p>Researchers fear chemicals from plastics can spread into water and food.</p>
<p>Muncke said, "We're finding hundreds, if not thousands, of plastic chemicals in people now and some of them have been linked to <strong>adverse</strong> health outcomes."</p>
<p>Activists say such effects include possible harm to the reproductive system and <strong>cardiovascular</strong> disease.</p>
<p>Martin Wagner is the lead writer of the study. He is an environmental scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He said researchers find hundreds, if not thousands, of chemicals in everyday products when they look for them.</p>
<p>Kimberly Wise White is with the American Chemistry Council, an industry group. She said the findings "ignore real-world <strong>exposures</strong>." She added the findings "paint an incomplete picture" for policy makers and the public. The plastics industry has said any worldwide treaty should support <strong>recycling</strong> and re-use of plastic.</p>
<p>But the writers of the recent report said that only dealing with plastic waste does not go far enough. They said there is a need for more information on chemicals in plastics, including recycled products. About 25 percent of the chemicals found lacked information on their chemical identity, the report said.</p>
<p>Wagner said the problem "is the chemical complexity of plastics." He is a leading member of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. It is an organization of scientists and experts seeking to advise the plastics treaty process.</p>
<p>Wagner said, "Often producers don't really know which kind of chemicals they have in their products and that comes from very complex value chains."</p>
<p>Six percent of the chemicals found in plastics are <strong>regulated</strong> internationally. Wagner said that without regulations, there is no reason for companies to identify what is in the plastics.</p>
<p>Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said there were around 13,000 chemicals in plastics.</p>
<p>Negotiations will continue in Ottawa, Canada. The aim is to finish a version of a treaty by December in the South Korean city of Busan.</p>

            <title>US Approves Weight-loss Drug to Reduce Heart Disease Risk  (2024/3/19)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">18 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>In 2021, the U.S. food and drug agency approved the drug Wegovy for weight loss. Now, the Food and Drug Administration (or, FDA) says the drug can reduce the risk of death from stroke or heart attack in adults who have <strong>cardiovascular</strong> disease or are overweight.</p>
<p>The FDA approved a usage change requested by drugmaker Novo Nordisk. The change expands the use of semaglutide, the general or <strong>generic</strong> name of the drug. Wegovy is the brand name given by the company that sells it.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pictured here is an injection pen of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy. (REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/illustrated archive photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-21a6-08dbaf0b74ac_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pictured here is an injection pen of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy. (REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/illustrated archive photo)</span></div>
<p>The FDA based its decision on the results of a study that found Wegovy cut the risk of serious heart problems. The study also found that overweight patients with heart disease but not diabetes were 20 percent less likely to experience those problems. Researchers compared the results of patients who took the drug with those who took a <strong>placebo</strong>, or inactive injections.</p>
<p>Wegovy is the first medication approved to help prevent possibly life-threatening disease in overweight people, the agency said.</p>
<p>Dr. John Sharretts directs the FDA's Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity. He said, "Providing a treatment <strong>option</strong> that is proven to lower this cardiovascular risk" is good for public health.</p>
<p>Dr. Martha Gulati said the decision will change the way many heart patients are treated. Gulati is a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The research also confirms that the new class of obesity medications are useful for improving health, not just losing weight.</p>
<p>"The hope is that insurers will start understanding that this is not a <strong>vanity </strong>drug," Gulati said. So-called vanity drugs are drugs that serve no medical purpose. Some researchers call them "lifestyle" drugs. Gulati estimates that nearly 70 percent of her heart patients could be <strong>eligible </strong>for treatment.</p>
<p>Wegovy is a high-<strong>dose</strong> version of the drug Ozempic. Ozempic is a diabetes treatment. The FDA approved the drug to cut the risk of serious heart problems in people with disease. The weight-loss drug costs about $1,300 a month.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk has also asked European Union officials to expand the use of the drug for heart problems.</p>
<p>The FDA warned that Wegovy carries the risk of serious side effects. These included thyroid <strong>tumors</strong> and certain cancers. Other possible side effects can include low blood sugar. Organs in the body can be affected such as the pancreas, gallbladder, kidney, or eye. Another possible side effect is suicidal behavior or thinking.</p>
<p>The <strong>clinical trial, </strong>which resulted in the drug's approval, involved more than 17,600 people. About one third of them reported serious side effects. About 17 percent of the group that took Wegovy and about eight percent of those who received a placebo left the study because of reported side effects.</p>
<p>The new approval could mean that Medicare might increase coverage to the drug. Medicare is the federal health coverage program for retirement-aged citizens. U.S. law bars Medicare from covering drugs for weight loss alone. Recent estimates say nearly $3 billion was spent in 2021 covering Ozempic to treat diabetes.</p>
<p>Tricia Neuman is a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco that researches health policy. She said the change "... will open the door to allow more people on Medicare to gain access to Wegovy."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans said private health coverage companies will consider the new guidance for Wegovy.</p>
<p>Drugmakers and activists for lower <strong>obesity</strong> rates have been pushing for expanded coverage. This includes legislation that would require Medicare to pay for the obesity drug. The cost of the drug needs to be balanced by reduced spending on medical care related to obesity and heart disease.</p>
<p>Another problem is a limited supply of the drug. The FDA said there has been a shortage for more than a year. Novo Nordisk officials said they are aiming to increase production.</p>
<p>For Gulati, the heart specialist, wider use cannot come soon enough.</p>
<p>"Everybody (is) waiting to get this medication," she said. "Lower the cost, do (not) be <strong>greedy </strong>and make sure the drug is available for use."</p>

            <title>Vernal Equinox Marks Arrival of Spring  (2024/3/19)</title>

<p>This year, the vernal equinox officially arrives on Tuesday, March 19 at 11:06 pm in Washington, D.C. That is 3:06 UTC on Wednesday, March 20. At that time, the sun will be exactly above the Earth's equator.</p>
<p>The word vernal comes from the Latin word <em>vernalis</em>, meaning "of the spring." And equinox comes from the Latin words <em>aequus</em>, meaning equal, and <em>nox</em>, meaning night. The day has 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of nighttime.</p>
<p>And in the Northern Hemisphere, the day marks the beginning of spring.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People take photographs of cherry blossom trees that have begun to bloom, Monday, March 20, 2023, along the tidal basin in Washington, on the first day of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

<p>On this day, people living in colder areas of the Northern Hemisphere hope they can put away their winter clothes. They also may soon start planting flowers and vegetables in a garden.</p>
<p>Here in Washington, D.C., March 20 also marks the first day of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Each year, people from around the world come to see the beautiful pink and white blossoms on the thousands of flowering cherry trees. For Washingtonians, the cherry blossoms are a welcome sign that spring has arrived.</p>
<p>In ancient times, some cultures built structures to signal the start of spring. Around the year 1000 A.D., for example, the Maya built a <strong>pyramid </strong>in what is now Mexico's Yucatan. It sits within an ancient city called Chichen Itza.</p>
<p>On the spring equinox, the sunlight hits in a way that makes the structure look like a snake. The Maya called this day "the return of the Sun <strong>serpent</strong>."</p>
<p>Today, cultures worldwide have their own ways of identifying and celebrating the arrival of spring.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry blossoms</strong></p>
<p>In Japan, spring is marked with a huge cherry blossom festival, known as <em>hanami.</em> The tradition dates back more than a thousand years. People gather under the <strong>blooming </strong>trees to eat, drink tea, celebrate and enjoy the cherry blossoms, known as <em>sakura</em> in Japanese. Artists and poets celebrate the short-lived blooms as a symbol of beauty.</p>
<p>In 1912, Japan gave 3,000 cherry trees to the U.S. capital city of Washington, D.C. The gift was to honor the lasting friendship between the United States and Japan. </p>
<p><strong>Nowruz</strong></p>
<p>For many countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, the vernal equinox also marks the beginning of a new year. The celebration is called Nowruz. The words "now" and "ruz" mean "new day" in Farsi.</p>
<p>Countries along the ancient Silk Road trading path, including Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian nations, celebrate Nowruz.</p>
<p>In the past, Iran was the only country where Nowruz was an official holiday. But after countries gained their independence following the fall of the Soviet Union, many made Nowruz a national holiday, as well.</p>
<p>During Nowruz, people visit family members and friends and exchange gifts. Iranian families set up a "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nowruz-in-america/3774295.html" target="_blank">haft seen</a>" <strong>display</strong> of seven special items that represent spring and new beginnings.</p>
<p>In Uzbekistan and other places in Central Asia, people watch wrestling events, horse races and a special horseback game called, in Uzbek, <em>Kopkari</em>. In this game, two teams of players on horseback try to get the body of a headless goat into a goal. A similar game is called <em>buzkashi </em>in Afghanistan and <em>oghlak tartish </em>in Kyrgyzstan and Uyghur-speaking areas.</p>
<p><strong>Holi festival</strong></p>
<p>Many in India and Nepal mark the arrival of spring with the Holi festival, known also as the festival of colors or the festival of love.</p>
<p>This year, Holi will take place on March 25.</p>
<p>People celebrate the festival by covering each other in -- you guessed it -- colors! Children especially enjoy the festival, as they get to throw colored <strong>powder</strong> and water-filled balloons at others.</p>
<p>Some say the festival comes from a story of the burning of the devil Holika. It represents the victory of good over evil, or the arrival of spring after a long, dark winter.</p>
<p>Others say the celebration was inspired by the story of two young lovers with different skin colors. Krishna, who has blue skin, was in love with Radha. So, he colored Radha with paint leading to the modern-day colorful festival of love.</p>
<p><strong>Las Fallas</strong></p>
<p>People in Valencia, Spain, have their spring celebration called <em>Las Fallas</em>. It is a wild street festival involving fire.</p>
<p>The festival centers on the creation – and burning – of huge colorful <strong>statues</strong> made of wood, paper and plastic. The statues are meant to look like real people. Valencian communities and organizations work all year to create these structures and place them throughout the city, with fireworks inside.</p>
<p><em>Las Fallas </em>celebrations began on March 15, with events like bullfights, parades, and cooking and beauty competitions. Then, at midnight on March 19, the city turns off all its streetlights and the statues<em> </em>are set on fire.</p>
<p>This marks the end of the festival and the beginning of spring.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">One early morning in Washington, D.C., many years ago, the president of the United States took off his clothes and jumped into the Potomac river. Moments later, he saw a dead man float to the surface.</p>
<p>The president was John Quincy Adams, the nation's sixth leader. And we know about the incident because he wrote about it in his diary.</p>
<p>A diary is a daily record of events of one's life, especially of personal experiences and thoughts.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Archivist of the U.S John Carlin stands behind a 1947 Harry Truman presidential diary, July 10, 2003, at the National Archives in Washington.

<p>American presidents from George Washington to Joe Biden, have been known to keep diaries. The men wrote about everyday experiences and thoughts. They also wrote about important decisions they made and the reasoning behind such decisions.</p>
<p>Adams called his diary his "second <strong>conscience</strong>." Barack Obama said his diary is a process of turning thoughts into writing that "makes you ask <strong>tougher</strong> questions."</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter left the White House with more than 5,000 pages of such notes. He said, "I seldom exercised any restraint on what I <strong>dictated</strong>."</p>
<p>Dwight Eisenhower wrote about disputes within a scientific advisory group and some of its proposals about Soviet atomic bombs. And Donald Trump's daily writing was seen by the public on Twitter, now known as X.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets in diaries</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the presidential diaries contain secrets that they should not.</p>
<p>Robert Hur was the special <strong>counsel</strong> who investigated Biden's handling of <strong>classified</strong> information after his time serving as vice president. He reported that Biden's diary contained notes from intelligence briefings, including some classified as "top secret."</p>
<p>The 1978 Presidential Records Act says that the U.S. government has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2202" target="_blank">"complete ownership, possession, and control"</a> of all presidential and vice presidential records. The act does not cover personal diaries. But classified information is not supposed to be in those.</p>
<p>Hur noted in his report that both Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush had classified information in their diaries.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan left the White House in 1989. He took with him eight years of handwritten diaries, the report says, "which he appears to have kept at his California home even though they contained Top Secret information."</p>
<p>Hur wrote, "Historically, after leaving office, many former presidents and vice presidents have knowingly taken home sensitive materials related to national security from their administrations without being charged with crimes."</p>
<p>Both Biden and former President Donald Trump have been investigated for their handling of classified information. But only Trump is being accused of resisting demands to return them.</p>
<p><strong>Values of diaries</strong></p>
<p>Students of history have always been interested in presidential diaries.</p>
<p>They "provide <strong>unique</strong> windows into the presidency, helping us better understand how policy is made and power is used," said Marc Selverstone, director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.</p>
<p>As for John Quincy Adams, all 15,000 pages of his diaries written over 68 years are available to the public. The Massachusetts Historical Society, which publishes them online, said his diaries represent "the longest continuous record of any American of the time."</p>
<p>On <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v49-1825-07-22-p865" target="_blank">July 22, 1825</a>, Adams wrote, "I <strong>stripped</strong> and went in to the river; I had been not more than ten minutes swimming when the drag boat started, and they were not five minutes from the shore when the body floated immediately opposite the rock; less than one hundred yards from the <strong>shore</strong>."</p>
<p>The entry noted the death of Mr. Shoemaker, a post office worker seen swimming about in the water earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Research in the growing field of space medicine has identified many ways in which zero-gravity and other conditions can affect the human body. Now, a new study finds that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known.<br/>
太空医学领域的研究已经确定了零重力和其他条件对人体产生影响的多种方式。现在，一项新的研究发现，宇航员在太空中比以前更容易出现头痛。</p>
<p>The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European and Japanese space agencies. They all traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.<br/>
这项研究涉及来自美国、欧洲和日本航天机构的24名宇航员。他们都在国际空间站上旅行了长达26周。除两人外，其他人都报告在太空中出现头痛。</p>
<p>Headaches struck a larger number of astronauts than the scientists had expected. The headaches continued even after the crew had been in space long enough for the body to adjust. The process takes place in the first two weeks in space.<br/>
头痛困扰的宇航员人数超过了科学家们的预期。即使乘员在太空中停留了足够让身体适应的时间，头痛仍在继续。这个过程发生在太空的前两周。</p>
<p>The headaches during the early period often presented similarly to migraines. Those experienced later in space travel presented more like a tension headache, the study found.<br/>
早期的头痛通常与偏头痛相似。研究发现，太空旅行者后期经历的更像是一种紧张性的头痛。</p>
<p>Neurologist WPJ van Oosterhout of Zaans Medical Center and the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands was lead author of the study. He said the research suggests different processes "are involved for the early headache episodes - the first one to two weeks in space - versus later headache episodes."<br/>
荷兰Zaans医学中心和莱顿大学医学中心的神经学家WPJ·范·奥斯特霍特是这项研究的主要作者。他说，研究表明，“在太空前一到两周出现的早期头痛发作与后期头痛发作涉及不同的过程。”</p>
<p>The study was published this week in the journal Neurology.<br/>
这项研究发表在本周的《神经病学》杂志上。</p>
<p>"In the first week, the body has to adapt to the lack of gravity, known as space adaptation syndrome. This phenomenon is similar to motion sickness, and can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness, and headaches," Van Oosterhout said. "The later headaches could result from ... more fluid accumulating in the upper part of the body and head...."<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说：“在第一周，身体必须适应重力不足，这被称为空间适应综合征。这种现象类似于晕动病，会导致恶心、呕吐、头晕和头痛。后来的头痛可能是由于更多液体积聚在身体上部和头部。”</p>
<p>Migraines experienced on Earth are often throbbing, and last four to seven hours, along with symptoms like nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound, Van Oosterhout said. Tension headaches on Earth usually are a dull pain felt over the whole head, he said.<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说，地球上经历的偏头痛通常是有规律性抽痛，它会持续四到七个小时，伴有恶心、呕吐、对光和声音敏感等症状。他说，紧张性头痛在地球上通常是一种感觉到整个头部的隐隐作痛。</p>
<p>The astronauts, 23 men and one woman, had an average age of about 47. They visited the International Space Station for missions that took place from November 2011 to June 2018. A total of 378 headaches were reported by 22 of the 24 astronauts during a total of 3,596 days in orbit. None of the 24 reported headaches in the three months after returning to Earth. None had ever had migraines before their time in space and none had a history of usual headache attacks.<br/>
这些包括23男1女的宇航员的平均年龄约47岁。2011年11月至2018年6月，他们访问了国际空间站执行任务。24名宇航员中的22人在总共3596天的轨道任务中总共报告了378次头痛。这24人在返回地球后的三个月内都没有报告头痛。在进入太空之前，没有人患过偏头痛，也没有人有常见的头痛发作史。</p>
<p>Documented effects of space travel include bone and muscle weakening, or atrophy, changes in the brain, cardiovascular system and immune system. Astronauts have also experienced effects on the inner ear and a condition involving the eyes. The risk of cancer from high radiation levels in space is another concern.<br/>
有文献记载的太空旅行的影响包括骨骼和肌肉减弱或萎缩、大脑、心血管系统和免疫系统的变化。宇航员还经历了内耳和眼睛的影响。太空中高辐射水平导致癌症的风险是另一个令人担忧的问题。</p>
<p>Experts are unsure how much of a barrier these effects might have on human space travel over long periods, like trips to Mars or beyond.<br/>
专家们不确定这些影响对人类长期太空旅行（如火星或更远的地方）可能会产生多大的影响。</p>
<p>"The honest answer is that we don't know the effects of long-duration space travel - possibly years - on the human body," Van Oosterhout said, adding, this "is a clear task for the field of space medicine."<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说：“老实说，我们不知道可能几年的长时间太空旅行对人体的影响。”他补充道，这“是太空医学领域的一项明确任务。”</p>

            <title>North America Prepares for 2024 Total Solar Eclipse  (2024/3/18)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">17 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A total solar eclipse will take place in North America on April 8. Millions of people will be able to fully experience the event, which is expected to darken the sky for more than four minutes.</p>
<p>A total solar eclipse happens when the sun, moon and Earth perfectly line up. This results in sunlight being blocked. The quality of the observations will depend on weather and the position where people watch the eclipse from.</p>
<p>The path of totality – meaning places where people will see a total blockage of the sun – will stretch across areas of Mexico, the United States and Canada. People in North America who are outside of this path will still be able to see a partial eclipse.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The progression of a total solar eclipse is seen with the moon passing in front of the sun above Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia, on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 1995. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-7e80-08dc446b2d55_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The progression of a total solar eclipse is seen with the moon passing in front of the sun above Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia, on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 1995. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)</span></div>
<p>The American space agency NASA says the eclipse will begin over the South Pacific and reach Mexico's Pacific coast at around 11:07 a.m. Pacific Time. It will then enter the United States in Texas.</p>
<p>The path of totality will then pass through a series of states before heading out from the northernmost state of Maine. The eclipse will enter Canada in Ontario and move across the nation before leaving northeastern Canada into the Atlantic.</p>
<p>An estimated 44 million people live inside the 185-kilometer-wide path of totality, with about 32 million in the U.S.</p>
<p>The eclipse is expected to last four minutes and 28 seconds, about twice as long as the one that darkened skies in 2017. The U.S. is not set to see another coast-to-coast total solar eclipse until 2045.</p>
<p>NASA's eclipse watch program is led by Kelly Korreck. She told The Associated Press the eclipse will permit many people to experience the "wonder of the universe without going very far."</p>
<p>People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial eclipse. The farther these people are from the path, the less the sun will be covered. For example, experts say Americans farthest from this path – such as in the northwestern cities of Seattle and Portland – will see about one-third of the sun blocked.</p>
<p>As was the case with past eclipse events, people are being warned about the dangers of looking directly at the sun during the event. Since normal sunglasses are not considered effective protection, special eclipse glasses are suggested for eclipse watchers. The glasses should only be removed during moments when the sun's face is covered during complete totality.</p>
<p>A total solar eclipse develops in several different parts, or stages. The event starts with a partial eclipse as the moon begins to pass between Earth and the sun. During this stage, a partial blockage leaves the sun looking a bit like a banana.</p>
<p>During the next stage, called Baily's Beads, points of light from the sun shine around the moon's edges. This effect is produced by the moon's differing <strong>landscapes</strong>. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/what-to-expect/">notes</a> this stage is quite short and "may not last long enough to be <strong>noticeable</strong> to all observers of the total solar eclipse."</p>
<p>In the Diamond Ring stage, a single bright spot appears along the lunar edge even as the sun's atmosphere leaves a ring of light around the moon. This effect – which comes right before totality – looks similar to a diamond ring.</p>
<p>After totality, the other stages then repeat as the moon keeps moving along its path until the end of the eclipse.</p>
<p>Total solar eclipses generally happen every few years, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse will arrive in 2026. It will be observable along the northern edges of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.</p>
<p>North America will not experience totality again until 2033, with that one only passing over Alaska. It will happen next in 2044, with totality limited to Western Canada and the U.S. states of Montana and North Dakota.</p>
<p>The next coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in the U.S. is expected to happen in 2045. NASA says that one will stretch from Northern California to Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>

            <title>Bird Flu Spread Increasing, Killing South American Wildlife  (2024/3/18)</title>

<p>The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading more aggressively than ever before since its arrival in South America in 2022. It is killing wild birds and marine mammals on the continent.</p>
<p>Reuters recently spoke to eight experts in bird flu science. All said the current spread raises the risk of the virus becoming a bigger threat to humans.</p>
<p>The more immediate concern is that the disease, which once affected mostly birdlife, appears to be spreading between mammals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A dead pig and a dead penguin lie on the Atlantic Ocean's coast, during a Bird Flu outbreak, in Sao Jose do Norte, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, November 21, 2023.

(REUTERS/Diego Vara/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>The disease has already killed several dolphins in Chile and Peru. It has also killed about 50,000 seals and sea lions along the coasts and at least half a million birds across South America.</p>
<p>Scientists have not yet tested infections in living animals to confirm mammal-to-mammal passage of the virus. But they believe it is very likely.</p>
<p>"It's almost <strong>certainly</strong> happened," said Richard Webby. He is a virologist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. "It's pretty hard to explain some of these large infections and die off without having mammal-to-mammal spread."</p>
<p>The same version of the virus has appeared in many bird species. Among them are migrating species, scientists told Reuters.</p>
<p>As climate change continues, animals are forced to move into new territories, often mixing with animals -- and viruses -- that are new to them.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of time before you will <strong>detect</strong> the first South American strain in North America," said Alonzo Alfaro-Nunez, a viral ecologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Human risk</strong></p>
<p>The growing concern led the intergovernmental Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to gather health experts and officials for a meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>The group plans to launch the world's first <strong>regional</strong> program to supervise bird flu spread. The program will run observation and <strong>response</strong> efforts, a PAHO official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Since the virus was first detected in Colombia in October 2022, there have been two known cases in humans on the continent. One was in Ecuador. The other was in Chile. Birds passed the virus in each case.</p>
<p>The patients survived. But often, H5N1 kills. About 60 percent of human cases of the virus end in death.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is unlikely to raise the H5N1 risk level for humans from the current "low" right now. The experts would require evidence of human-to-human transmission or signs of viral changes that would target humans, experts said.</p>
<p>Several drugmakers have said they are developing bird flu vaccines for humans.</p>
<p>"We're seeing (the virus) do... little <strong>evolutionary</strong> steps that are on the long-term moving towards a <strong>potential</strong> human infection," said Ralph Vanstreels. He is a researcher at the University of California, Davis. He is studying South American variants of H5N1.</p>
<p><strong>Regional response</strong></p>
<p>With health officials and experts meeting in Rio this week, Latin American countries will be pressured to increase disease surveillance in the wild.</p>
<p>The region's data is lacking and limited resources have left scientists struggling to understand how the disease is spreading in the wild. Scientists expect the number of cases is probably much higher than reported. Some cases are not getting laboratory testing.</p>
<p>Bolivia, for example, did not register a case in the wild last year. But the disease has been reported in surrounding countries, said Manuel Jose Sanchez Vazquez, a disease expert for PAHO's animal health center.</p>
<p>Overseeing<strong> </strong>the disease response can also be complex, Sanchez noted. Public health officials deal with threats to humans. Agricultural experts and <strong>veterinarians</strong> deal with health threats to farm animals, including birds, cows and pigs. But for wild animal health, care and supervision is provided mostly by environmental officials.</p>
<p>The new regional commission is expected to be announced on Thursday. The group would aim to set methods for observing, treating and reporting cases among government agencies. It could also help in sharing laboratory resources.</p>
<p>"We are worried and we are <strong>vigilant</strong>," Sanchez said. "The more <strong>adaptation</strong> of the virus to mammals, the more likely it is that transmission to humans could happen."</p>

<p>My name is Nadiia Kyba. I am from Cherkasy. And this is my essay.</p>
<p>They come in white, red, orange, brown, and yellow. They are the flowers in the gardens of Ukraine. And they are the lessons that I learned from childhood.</p><p><img alt="FILE - A woman poses for a picture at a flower exhibition in Kyiv, Ukraine, August 21, 2015. (REUTERS/Gleb Garanich)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/352B5EC8-B177-4CCF-8AD0-5B32B8C7B41C_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman poses for a picture at a flower exhibition in Kyiv, Ukraine, August 21, 2015.

<p>As a child, I remember plenty of snowdrops in my grandmother's garden. The fragile petals managed to blossom despite a heavy snowstorm. I wanted to bring the white flowers into the house. But I was not permitted to step on them or to pick them. My parents said, "We must all cherish the snowdrops. There is no use in withered flowers."</p>
<p>Little did I know back then that snowdrops were very rare, and they almost disappeared. I did not know it was more important to have them in the garden. Luckily, there were people who knew better. They created a reserve in Kholodnyi Yar to protect and care for those beautiful white flowers. They taught me to care for and protect even the smallest things.</p>
<p>I lived in a village where children always helped to take care of its flowerbeds. At school, our class weeded beds of roses nearby. It was great fun to be outdoors in the fresh air. Moreover, the roses looked splendid. They smelled sweet in the sun, and girls used to pin them in their hair. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can still smell the beautiful roses.</p>
<p>The first time I worked in a bed of roses, I prickled my hand with small but sharp thorns. I did not know that such beauty could hurt you. I understood then that it took much pain to gain something so beautiful.</p>
<p>That was one of the most important lessons in my life. If I want something, I must be ready to work hard for it. The roses taught me to be persistent and hardy. And the roses showed me "no pain, no gain."</p>
<p>What comes to your mind when you hear the word "garden"?</p>
<p>I see marigolds. I see orange, brown, and yellow marigolds. There are so many marigolds in the gardens of Ukrainians, that it is hard not to notice them. People sing songs about marigolds. They are everywhere, under the apple trees, in the strawberries, near the fences, in the flowerbeds, and even on the roads.</p>
<p>I used to plant marigolds with my mother. We gathered the seeds in autumn. Then we shared and exchanged the seeds with our friends or neighbors. I have warm memories of my family sitting on the bench in front of the marigold beds. My father told stories. And we chatted and joked.</p>
<p>Marigolds remind me of home and the best moments of our lives. They taught me to share and communicate, to be a daughter and a friend.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is adding to the threat of election disinformation worldwide.</p>
<p>The technology makes it easy for anyone with a smartphone and an imagination to create <strong>fake </strong>– but convincing – content aimed at fooling voters.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, fake photos, videos or audio required teams of people with time, skill and money. Now, free and low-cost generative artificial intelligence services from companies like Google and OpenAI permit people to create high-quality "deepfakes" with just a simple text entry.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An advertising banner with a slogan about AI is fixed at a building at the Davos Promenade, alongside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1395462a-a385-4366-8108-5652f0125761_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An advertising banner with a slogan about AI is fixed at a building at the Davos Promenade, alongside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 18, 2024.

<p><strong>Expanding threats</strong></p>
<p>A wave of AI deepfakes tied to elections in Europe and Asia has already appeared on social media for months. It served as a warning for more than 50 countries having elections this year.</p>
<p>Some recent examples of AI deepfakes include:</p>
<p>— A video of Moldova's pro-Western president throwing her support behind a political party friendly to Russia.</p>
<p>— Audio of Slovakia's liberal party leader discussing changing ballots and raising the price of beer.</p>
<p>— A video of an opposition lawmaker in Bangladesh — a conservative Muslim majority nation — wearing a <strong>bikini</strong>.</p>
<p>The question is no longer whether AI deepfakes could affect elections, but how influential they will be, said Henry Ajder, who runs a business advisory company called Latent Space Advisory in Britain.</p>
<p>"You don't need to look far to see some people ... being clearly confused as to whether something is real or not," Ajder said.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge to democracy</strong></p>
<p>As the U.S. presidential race comes closer, Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning about the growing threat of generative AI. He said the technology makes it easy for foreign groups to attempt to have a bad influence on elections.</p>
<p>With AI deepfakes, a candidate's image can be made much worse or much better. Voters can be moved toward or away from candidates — or even to avoid the polls altogether. But perhaps the greatest threat to democracy, experts say, is that the growth of AI deepfakes could hurt the public's trust in what they see and hear.</p>
<p>The complexity of the technology makes it hard to find out who is behind AI deepfakes. Experts say governments and companies are not yet capable of stopping the problem.</p>
<p>The world's biggest tech companies recently — and voluntarily — signed an agreement to prevent AI tools from disrupting elections. For example, the company that owns Instagram and Facebook has said it will start <strong>labeling</strong> deepfakes that appear on its services.</p>
<p>But deepfakes are harder to limit on apps like Telegram, which did not sign the voluntary agreement. Telegram uses <strong>encrypted </strong>messages that can be difficult to uncover.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about efforts to limit AI</strong></p>
<p>Some experts worry that efforts to limit AI deepfakes could lead to unplanned results.</p>
<p>Tim Harper is an expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, DC. He said sometimes well-meaning governments or companies might crush the "very thin" line between political commentary and an "<strong>illegitimate </strong>attempt to<strong> smear </strong>a candidate."</p>
<p>Major generative AI services have rules to limit political disinformation. But experts say it is too easy to defeat the restrictions or use other services.</p>
<p>AI software is not the only threat.</p>
<p>Candidates themselves could try to fool voters by claiming events that show them in bad situations were manufactured by AI.</p>
<p>Lisa Reppell is a researcher at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>She said, "A world in which everything is suspect — and so everyone gets to choose what they believe — is also a world that's really challenging for...democracy."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked closely at a piece of wood? If you have, you might have noticed its beautiful grain.</p>
<p>When talking about wood, grain describes the appearance of cell fibers in the wood. A wood's grain is important when choosing the right sort of wood for a project. Different kinds of wood have different grains, which affect their appearance, strength, and usefulness.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this picture taken on August 19, 2023, a worker crafts a Kashmiri willow wood cricket bat at a factory in Kashmir's Sangam village. (Photo by Tauseef MUSTAFA / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f6d2-08dbbe55a392_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - In this picture taken on August 19, 2023, a worker crafts a Kashmiri willow wood cricket bat at a factory in Kashmir's Sangam village.

<p>Paying attention to a wood's grain helps you to know how to work with it. For example, if you are cutting a wood <strong>board</strong> with the grain, you would use a tool called a rip saw. If you are cutting across the grain, you would use a crosscut saw.</p>
<p>Cutting against the grain is more difficult. If you work against the wood grain, you might tear out pieces of wood or even damage your tools.</p>
<p>And that brings us to our expression: <u>to go against the grain.</u></p>
<p>If you go against the grain, you do something differently from what is normal or usual.</p>
<p>An idea or action that goes against the grain is difficult to do or accept. Usually, it goes against a person's ideals, beliefs, or principles.</p>
<p>If an idea or action goes against the grain, it is the opposite of what you believe is right or normal. You might find it difficult to accept. In some situations, it takes courage to go against the grain of what others are saying or doing and stand up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>Let's say a friend of yours is offered a sales job. To do the job well, he must <strong>convince</strong> people to buy things they don't need. He is a very honest man. So, for him this job goes against the grain.</p>
<p>To go against the grain can also mean to do things differently from others. Sometimes we want to go against the grain. We don't want to do things the way everyone else does. Artists often try to go against the grain and ignore the common, popular <strong>trends </strong>of the day.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear the expression used between two friends.</p>
<p><em>A: Did you hear about Jenny taking that corporate banking job? </em></p>
<p><em>B: I did! I'm really happy for her. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Happy? You must be kidding. Jenny is an artist. In college, we used to protest against big banks.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I know we did. But life is different now. We're older and have bills to pay. And I think Jenny wants to send her little sister to college. </em></p>
<p><em>A: I know. But a corporate job? Jenny? It just goes against the grain for her. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Look, we need to support our friend. Anything less would go against the grain for me.</em></p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>India Implements Much-debated New Citizenship Law  (2024/3/17)</title>

<p>India has put into effect a new law that makes it easier for non-Muslim minorities to seek Indian citizenship.</p>
<p>The much-debated law was first approved by India's parliament in 2019. But the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delayed <strong>implementing</strong> the measure because of huge protests by groups opposed to it.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the law shortly after it was approved in December 2019. At the time, news organizations reported at least 23 people were killed during days of protests.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Students protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Guwahati, India, Tuesday, March 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-fc2a-08dc442cd0f8_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Students protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Guwahati, India, Tuesday, March 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath)</span></div>
<p>The law seeks to give Indian citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and other minorities who fled Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to escape mistreatment based on religion. Muslims are not covered by the law.</p>
<p>Modi's Hindu nationalist-led government has said the law is designed to ease the suffering of many people who long faced unfair treatment in India. Critics say the measure is a government attempt to <strong>marginalize</strong> India's 200 million Muslims.</p>
<p>A message issued by the prime minister's office confirmed the new law had been activated. "The Modi government announces implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act," a spokesperson wrote in a text message.</p>
<p>The measure is an important policy of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The spokesperson said the measure clears the way "for the <strong>persecuted</strong> to find citizenship in India."</p>
<p>A statement by the Home Ministry said the law aims to remove legal barriers to citizenship for refugees in order to provide a "<strong>dignified</strong> life" to those who have long suffered in India.</p>
<p>The statement added that "many <strong>misconceptions</strong>" had been spread among the public about the law. "This Act is only for those who have suffered persecution for years and have no other shelter in the world except India," it said.</p>
<p>The government said citizenship seekers can begin the process by entering their information online through an official website.</p>
<p>Human rights group Amnesty India criticized implementation of the law, saying it "<strong>legitimizes</strong> discrimination based on religion."</p>
<p>Opponents have argued that if the law aims to protect persecuted minorities, it should have included Muslim religious minorities. The critics say these groups – including Ahmadis in Pakistan and Rohingyas in Myanmar – have already faced persecution in their own countries.</p>
<p>The opposition Communist Party of India – which rules the southern state of Kerala - called for state-wide protests to demonstrate their opposition to the measure.</p>
<p>Kerala's Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said in a statement he sees the law leading to more divisions and believes it is not in line with the country's constitution. "This move to <strong>stratify</strong> Indian citizens who have equal rights, must be opposed unitedly."</p>
<p>India's 200 million Muslims make up a large minority group in the country's 1.4 billion population. Muslims live in almost every part of the country. They have been targeted in a series of attacks since Modi first came to power in 2014.</p>

            <title>Are Tiny Plastic Particles in Our Bodies Harmful?  (2024/3/16) | 微塑料是否对人体有害？</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A new study examines possible harm caused by microscopic pieces of plastic that end up inside people's bodies.<br/>
一项新的研究考察了最终进入人体的微小塑料碎片可能造成的危害。</p>
<p>These materials – known as microplastics and nanoplastics – can enter the body through the air or in food or drinks.<br/>
这些材料被称为微塑料和纳米塑料，它可以通过空气、食物或饮料进入人体。</p>
<p>Tiny plastic pieces have received widespread attention in the media. But so far, very little research has been done on how the substances affect human heart health.<br/>
微小的塑料制品受到了媒体的广泛关注。但到目前为止，关于这些物质如何影响人类心脏健康的研究很少。</p>
<p>One new study suggests the buildup of such plastics inside the body can increase the risk of a stroke, heart attack or death. But the researchers noted the evidence presented cannot prove a direct link between tiny plastic materials and heart problems.<br/>
一项新的研究表明，这种塑料在体内的堆积会增加中风、心脏病发作或死亡的风险。但研究人员指出，所提供的证据无法证明微小塑料材料与心脏问题之间的直接联系。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What did the study find?<br/>
该研究有何发现？</span></p>
<p>The study involved 257 people who had medical operations to clear blocked blood vessels in their necks. Italian researchers examined the fatty buildup the doctors removed from the carotid arteries, which supply blood and oxygen to the brain.<br/>
这项研究涉及257人，他们接受了清理颈部堵塞血管的医疗手术。意大利研究人员检查了医生从为大脑提供血液和氧气的颈动脉中清除的脂肪堆积物。</p>
<p>Using two methods, they found evidence of plastics – mostly nanoplastics that cannot be seen – in the artery plaque of 150 patients. No evidence of plastics was seen in 107 patients.<br/>
他们采用两种方法，在150名患者的动脉斑块中发现了塑料的证据，其中大部分是看不见的纳米塑料。在107名患者中没有发现塑料的迹象。</p>
<p>The team followed these people for three years. During that time, 30 individuals, or 20 percent of the group with plastics, had a heart attack, stroke, or died from any cause. These rates dropped to about eight percent among those with no evidence of plastics.<br/>
这个团队对这些人进行了为期三年的跟踪调查。在此期间，发现塑料的群体中有30人，占比20%，发生了心脏病、中风或死于各种原因。在那些没有塑料证据的群体中，这一比例降至8%左右。</p>
<p>Research results were recently published in a study in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br/>
研究结果最近发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》上的一项研究中。</p>
<p>The researchers also found more evidence of inflammation in individuals with tiny plastic bits in their blood. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury and is thought to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes.<br/>
研究人员还发现了血液中有微小塑料碎片的人出现炎症的更多证据。炎症是身体对损伤的反应，它被认为会增加心脏病发作和中风的风险。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the problems with the study?<br/>
这项研究有什么问题？</span></p>
<p>The researchers admitted their study was very small. For example, it only looked at people with narrowed arteries who were already at risk for heart attacks and stroke.<br/>
研究人员承认他们的研究规模很小。例如，它只观察了动脉狭窄的人群，这些人已经存在心脏病发作和中风的风险。</p>
<p>And the patients with the plastics had more heart disease, diabetes and high cholesterol than those without plastics. They were also more likely to be men and more likely to be smokers. Both of those groups generally have higher rates of heart disease.<br/>
检出塑料制品的患者比没有检出塑料制品的患者更容易发生心脏病、糖尿病和高胆固醇。他们也更有可能是男性，更有可能是吸烟者。这两组人通常都有较高的心脏病发病率。</p>
<p>The researchers tried to account for these risk differences. But they noted they may have missed some important elements that could change the results. The team said because of these ongoing questions, this kind of study cannot prove the plastics caused the health problems.<br/>
研究人员试图解释这些风险差异。但他们指出，他们可能错过了一些可能改变结果的重要因素。该团队表示，由于这些持续存在的问题，这类研究无法证明塑料导致了健康问题。</p>
<p>Steve Nissen is a heart expert at the Cleveland Clinic in the state of Ohio who was not part of the study. He told the Associated Press he thinks the team's estimate that the risk of heart attack, stroke or death was four times greater seems too high.<br/>
史蒂夫·尼森是俄亥俄州克利夫兰诊所的心脏病专家，他没有参与这项研究。他告诉美联社，他认为该研究小组估算心脏病发作、中风或死亡的风险高出四倍，这似乎太高了。</p>
<p>"It would mean that these microplastics are the most important cause of coronary heart disease yet discovered. And I just don't think that's likely to be right," Nissen said.<br/>
尼森说：“这意味着这些微塑料是迄今为止发现的导致冠心病的最重要原因。我只是认为这不太可能是对的。”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is next for the researchers?<br/>
研究人员的下一步是什么？</span></p>
<p>Philip Landrigan of Boston College University told the AP that more research is needed on the issue. Landrigan, who wrote about the study in the Journal, said it is the first one suggesting a connection between microplastics and nanoplastics with disease in humans. Other scientists have found plastic bits in the lungs, liver, blood, placenta and breast milk.<br/>
波士顿学院大学的菲利普·兰德里根告诉美联社，需要对这个问题进行更多的研究。兰德里根在《华尔街日报》上撰文谈到了这项研究，他说这是第一个表明微塑料和纳米塑料与人类疾病之间存在联系的研究。其他科学家已经在肺、肝、血液、胎盘和母乳中发现了塑料碎片。</p>
<p>"It does not prove cause and effect, but it suggests cause and effect," Landrigan said. "And it needs urgently to be either replicated or disproven by other studies done by other investigators in other populations."<br/>
兰德里根说：“它不能证明因果关系，但它启发了因果关系。它迫切需要被其他研究人员在其他人群中进行的其它研究所重复或推翻。”</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic's Nissen added about the study, "It's a wake-up call that perhaps we need to take the problem of microplastics more seriously. As a cause for heart disease? Not proven. As a potential cause? Yes, maybe," Nissen said.<br/>
克利夫兰诊所的尼森在谈到这项研究时补充道，“这是一个警钟，也许我们需要更认真地对待微塑料问题。作为心脏病的病因？尚未被证实。作为潜在病因？是的，也许。”</p>

<span class="datetime">15 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>What do you get when you cross the sports of <strong>rodeo</strong> with skiing? An extreme winter sport called skijoring.</p>
<p>The competition involves riding horses that <strong>tow</strong> skiers by rope over jumps and around barriers. At the same time, competitors try to <strong>lance</strong> round targets with a baton, a special stick for the purpose.</p>
<p>Skijoring is a winter sport that celebrates the combination of rodeo and ski culture in the U.S. Mountain West.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A skijoring team competes in Leadville, Colo., on Saturday, March 2, 2024.

<p>Horses — and sometimes dogs, snowmobiles and even cars — tow skiers by rope at speeds as high as 64 kilometers per hour. Skiers can go over jumps as high as 2.4 meters.</p>
<p>One of the most popular skijoring races in the country takes place in Leadville, Colorado. The event, called "The Granddaddy of 'em All," has been a tradition there since 1949.</p>
<p>"It's just the pure <strong>adrenaline</strong> that gets me to do it," said Nick Burri. He is one of the competitors and said teams get along with each other. "Getting these two different groups of people together with the riders and the skiers...we <strong>mesh</strong> pretty well."</p>
<p>Internet reports say skijoring takes its name from the Norwegian word skikjoring, which means "ski driving." It started as a way to get around in Scandinavia and became popular in Europe's Alps Mountains around 1900.</p>
<p>Today's sport is dangerous, and injuries are common among riders and skiers alike. One of the first riders in the Leadville race earlier this month fell off his horse and had to be helped off the track.</p>
<p>Burri did well in the competition although he was skiing with a separated shoulder that he suffered in a fall during a race two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Savannah McCarthy has been a competitive skijorer since she was 12 years old. She said she experiences a nervous energy before she rides her horse for a race. But once she is speeding down the course, her world goes silent.</p>
<p>"I don't hear a thing when I'm running," she said. "When it's happening, you really don't have time to think about anything." McCarthy is a 24-year-old financial worker from Durango, Colorado. She has won the Leadville race nine times.</p>
<p>Loren Zhimanskova is head of Skijor USA, which helps organize races across the country. She said skijoring is becoming more popular because of social media. She hopes it will one day be an event in the Winter Olympics. Skijoring is especially popular in Poland and Switzerland, as well as in the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.</p>
<p>Five years ago, the sport had about 350 teams of riders, skiers, and horses in the U.S., she said. Now, about 1,000 teams are competing, and the number of races has increased from about 15 a year to more than 30.</p>
<p>But getting the sport into the Olympics has proven difficult.</p>
<p>There is no official governing body. It has no clear set of rules. And there is no system that would permit riders to take part in the Winter Games. In addition, every course is different, and every race has its own special traditions.</p>
<p>Zhimanskova is pushing to include skijoring as a non-competitive demonstration sport. She said it could also be included in the <strong>torch</strong> <strong>relay</strong> at the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>"Everyone loves snow...and then you add horses to that," Zhimanskova said. "I mean, all the elements that go into a skijoring event, in my opinion, are really feel-good elements," she added.</p>

            <title>Using 'Just' and 'Only'  (2024/3/16)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gena Bennett</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Mohammad.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>What is the difference between just and only?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Using 'Just' and 'Only'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-2d6e-08dc442cb5c6_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Using 'Just' and 'Only'</span></div>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Mohammad. This is a good question.</p>
<p>In an earlier <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/just-and-only/5408390.html" target="_blank">explained</a> how the two words, "just" and "only," seem to mean the same thing. For example:</p>
<p><em>She was <u>just</u> a baby when she came to America.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>She was <u>only</u> a baby when she came to America.</em></p>
<p>In that article, we also explained how the two words have different meanings and when you should use one and not the other. The difference in usage is so small that you might not even notice at first. But it is very important.</p>
<p>So, let's look at more ways to use the two words today.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>Usage is the way in which a word or phrase is normally used.</p>
<p>The word "only" can be used in an undesirable situation. For example:</p>
<p><em>He <u>only</u> finished half his homework.</em></p>
<p><em><u>Only</u> two banks stay open after 4 p.m.</em></p>
<p><em>You're <u>only</u> coming on Saturday? I wish you could come earlier.</em></p>
<p>Its usage is also common when we are not happy about something:</p>
<p><em>It's <u>only</u> right that they get the same pay for the same work.</em></p>
<p><em>The noise is fine, <u>only</u> if it does not hurt my ear.</em></p>
<p>However, we use the word "just" when we want to make an <strong>emphasis</strong>, or a stronger statement. Let's compare the last two examples with these:</p>
<p><em>It's <u>just</u> not right that he gets more pay for the same work.</em></p>
<p><em>The noise hurts my ear. <u>Just</u> be quiet, please!</em></p>
<p>In spoken English, believe it or not, we also use "just" when we want to make something smaller or less important.</p>
<p>For example, when someone thinks the distance is too far, we might say:</p>
<p><em>Your friend lives <u>just</u> down the road.</em></p>
<p>If they do not have a lot of time, we might ask:</p>
<p><em>Can you wait <u>just</u> a minute?</em></p>
<p>And when someone appears to be busy, we might say:</p>
<p><em>Could I <u>just</u> ask you something?</em></p>
<p><em>I was <u>just</u> wondering, can we meet tomorrow?</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Mohammad.</p>

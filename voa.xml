        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>New Data Suggests Jupiter’s Moon Europa Has Less Oxygen than Expected  (2024/3/11)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">10 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A new study suggests Jupiter's icy moon Europa produces much less oxygen than previously thought.</p>
<p>The study was based on data collected by the American space agency NASA's Juno spacecraft. Juno is an orbiter that has been studying Jupiter since July 2016.</p>
<p>The study involved Juno's instruments measuring levels of oxygen and hydrogen molecules coming from Europa's atmosphere. The data showed the icy moon produces about 1,000 tons of oxygen every 24 hours. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/juno/nasas-juno-mission-measures-oxygen-production-at-europa/">said</a> that amount would be enough "to keep a million humans breathing for a day.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image made available by NASA in 2014 shows Jupiter's icy moon Europa in a reprocessed color view, made from images captured by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-cfbd-08dc3f79ca56_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image made available by NASA in 2014 shows Jupiter's icy moon Europa in a reprocessed color view, made from images captured by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute via AP)</span></div>
<p>However, the space agency noted those oxygen level estimates were "<strong>substantially</strong> less" than those measured in earlier studies about the moon.</p>
<p>Europa is a little smaller than Earth's moon. But it is still one of the largest in our solar system. NASA observations have suggested an ocean exists beneath a thick layer of ice on Europa's surface. Scientists estimate the moon's ocean may contain twice the amount of water as Earth's oceans.</p>
<p>The new study is based on data Juno collected in 2022 during a particularly close flyby of Europa. The flyby is believed to have brought the spacecraft within 350 kilometers of the moon.</p>
<p>The research was led by teams from Princeton University in New Jersey and Maryland's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.swri.org/">Southwest Research Institute</a>. The scientists estimated Europa is producing around 12 kilograms of oxygen per second. Earlier predictions suggested the moon was releasing up to 1,000 kilograms per second.</p>
<p>Since Europa is believed to have a large ocean under its surface, researchers in the past identified it <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/ocean-on-jupiter-moon-europa-may-have-supported-life/5481557.html">as a good candidate</a> to hold the right conditions to support some form of life. That data came mainly from telescope observations of oxygen levels existing in the moon's icy surface.</p>
<p>The new, lower oxygen estimates do not support the earlier observations. The team involved in the study said more research will be needed to confirm the latest findings.</p>
<p>Scott Bolton is a Juno investigator at the Southwest Research Institute and a co-writer of the study. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.swri.org/press-release/juno-spacecraft-measures-oxygen-production-jupiter-s-moon-europa">said</a> in a statement that the team's new findings have a direct effect on the possibility that Europa could be <strong>habitable</strong>. While the oxygen amounts measured were much lower, the latest study gives scientists "a narrow range that could support habitability," Bolton said.</p>
<p>Princeton University researcher Jamey Szalay was the study's lead writer. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.swri.org/press-release/juno-spacecraft-measures-oxygen-production-jupiter-s-moon-europa">said</a>, "The findings <strong>unambiguously</strong> demonstrate oxygen is continuously produced at the surface, just a good bit lower than we expected."</p>
<p>Szalay added that Juno's flyby of Europa marked the first time a spacecraft was able to directly measure the moon's atmosphere. "We couldn't wait to <strong>peek behind the curtain</strong> of its complex environment," he wrote to The Associated Press in an email.</p>
<p>The researchers said the new measurements can help scientists gain a better understanding of Europa and its environment, and "open the door for newer, more <strong>precise</strong> models."</p>
<p>Robert Ebert is a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute and a co-writer of the study. He said that even with the new results, he believes further investigations should take place to search for signs of life on Europa. "Water is important for the existence of life... Europa is a good place to search for water within our solar system."</p>
<p>NASA hopes to launch its Europa Clipper mission in October. This orbiter is designed to carry out close examinations of Europa. It will look for signs it might hold the right conditions to support life.</p>
<p>NASA says the orbiter plans to fly in orbit around Jupiter and "perform repeated close flybys of the ice moon."</p>

            <title>Garden Expert Tries New Fruits, Vegetables  (2024/3/11)</title>

<p>Jessica Damiano says crops like tomatoes, garlic, chives, basil, parsley, thyme, and sage have been permanent plants in her <strong>garden</strong> for ages. Damiano, a gardening expert who writes for The Associated Press, says every year, she experiments with new – or new to her – crops.</p>
<p>Many do not stay in her garden for long, like the Voyager tomatoes that lack taste or the goji berries she could not seem to eat. But others, like 8-ball zucchini, rainbow Swiss chard, and golden beets have earned permanent homes in her raised beds.</p>
<p>This year's new introductions are available in seed <strong>catalogs</strong> in the U.S.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Co. shows Lila Lu Sang carrots, which are deep purple on the outside and bright orange on the inside. (Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Co./rareseeds.com via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/673143a3-5d61-4aac-8711-ae45eb5d8372_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Co. shows Lila Lu Sang carrots, which are deep purple on the outside and bright orange on the inside.

<p>Four small apple trees from Plants Nouveau called Blushing Delight, Golden Treat, Tangy Green, and Tasty Red, work well for people like Damiano who have limited garden space. The trees grow to 2.5 to 3 meters tall and just a meter wide. And they will even grow in containers. You can plant two different kinds for cross-<strong>pollination</strong> and fruit production.</p>
<p>Another crop, Love Gourmansun beefsteak tomatoes from Burpee, is available in two different kinds that each produce 28-gram, heart-shaped fruits. Choose between Red and a yellow-red fruit called Sunrise. They grow in similar ways and taste similar, but have different disease resistance.</p>
<p>Damiano said she tested another crop from Burpee called Prism Sweet Peppers last summer. She said the sweet, bell-shaped fruits grew well in her garden. The productive plants also added beauty to her garden, as the crop turned from light green to orange and then red as the fruit aged. The result was many different colors of fruits on the plants at any one time.</p>
<p>The crop Quick Snack cucumbers are the newest addition to PanAm Seed's Kitchen Minis collection. They are small enough to be grown in a hanging basket or even indoors since they do not require pollination. The small cucumbers are <strong>crisp</strong> and sweet.</p>
<p>The Pastel Duo baby turnip seed mix, introduced from Japan by Renee's Garden, grows small, round roots in colors like pink and white. Both colors have a <strong>mild</strong>, sweet taste and thin skin that does not need to be removed.</p>
<p>Damiano says her Genovese basil plants often get the disease downy mildew more often than not. She said she is looking forward to growing Noga Prospera Active DMR <strong>organic </strong>basil, produced by Genesis Seeds. The plants are sold as "highly resistant" to the disease. But they are also slow to flower, which she says is another problem she often deals with in the height of the summer's heat.</p>
<p>Finally, the crop Lila Lu Sang carrots offered by Baker Seeds are just about as eye-catching as vegetables can get. They have a deep purple color on the outside and a bright orange color on the inside. But they are more than what one sees: they contain the gains of both purple and orange carrots. They are sweet, tasty and full of nutrients.</p>

<p>When visitors come to Paris for the Olympic Games starting in July, they will be entering the territory of France's most famous street artist: "Invader." It will be one invasion coming face-to-face with another.</p>
<p>Like Banksy, the British street artist he is sometimes compared to, Invader does not want his identity to be publicly known.</p>
<p>Sometimes working close to the edge of illegality, Invader comes, does his art, and disappears into the night. He leaves behind <strong>mosaics</strong> made mostly with small ceramic and glass <strong>tiles</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A mosaic by French artist Invader floats in the International Space Station in 2015. (Samantha Cristoforetti/ESA-NASA via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/8cd7e268-24be-4394-9b03-65b5e669f695_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A mosaic by French artist Invader floats in the International Space Station in 2015. (Samantha Cristoforetti/ESA-NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>Many of the mosaics look like the aliens from the Space Invaders video game. Others are very complex <strong>portrayals</strong> of fruit or, in New York, of Lou Reed and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Some of his artworks come from popular culture, including Spiderman, Star Wars, Bugs Bunny, Ninja Turtles, pizza and others. Some artworks suggest deep research, including a portrait of guitarist Django Reinhardt facing the house where he lived, south of Paris in Samois-sur-Seine.</p>
<p>Since the first recorded mosaic of a blue Space Invader went up on a Paris street in 1998, numbered PA_01, Invader has taken over the world. There are now more than 4,000 of his mosaics in cities and towns on all continents except Antarctica.</p>
<p>London, Tokyo, Los Angeles and other cities were invaded in 1999; New York and Geneva and more in 2000; Hong Kong in 2001; Berlin, Bangkok, Melbourne. On and on.</p>
<p>The 4,000th mosaic was <strong>glued</strong> to a brick wall in Potosi, 4,000 meters up in the Bolivian Andes, in 2021. The European Space Agency installed Invader's Space2 mosaic aboard the International Space Station in 2015.</p>
<p>"‘Anytime, Anywhere' is the philosophy," Invader says on his website.</p>
<p>In Paris — by far his most invaded area — the artist's footprint is larger than ever as the Olympics draw closer.</p>
<p>A new public showing in a multi-story building has one of his works on its roof, visible via satellite on Google Maps. With a telescope, the show's visitors can also look across Paris to Invader's 1,500th mosaic in the city and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Announced in February, PA_1500 is glued outside a chimney of the Pompidou Center. Unlike many of his other artworks, Invader got the center's permission to put the red-and-white Space Invader alien into place.</p>
<p>"It's a <strong>symbol</strong>. It's number 1,500. It's Paris," said Alexandre Aumis, the building's security director. He added, "It's got to be here."</p>
<p>Some of those who know Invader say they are expecting him to spring more surprises for the Olympics, perhaps installing new mosaics related to the Games.</p>
<p>Fabrice Bousteau is the <strong>editor</strong> of Beaux Arts Magazine. He said, "The invasion is the 15 million people who are going to arrive in Paris for the Olympic Games. It's a lot. Obviously, there will be Invader fans among them."</p>
<p>Bousteau, who also directed Invader's latest public showing, added, "So there will be this meeting between two cultures...He will doubtless invade the Games in a different way. I am almost certain."</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This story is one of the winning entries from the "Teach Us about Ukraine" writing contest sponsored by VOA Learning English and GoGlobal.</em></p>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Natalia Lavryk. I am an English teacher from Ukraine. I would like to introduce you to my country—its beautiful nature and very hard-working and friendly people, who most of all want peace, freedom, and independence.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Dovbush rocks, a group of rocks, natural and man-made caves carved into stone.

<p>As the world watches Ukraine's fight for freedom, its soldiers have become a symbol of unbreakable resistance. For Ukrainians, nothing represents that spirit more than the giant stones in the Carpathian Mountains called Dovbush Rocks.</p>
<p>Located on the border of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv areas, Dovbush Rocks covers about 100 hectares. The website <a class="wsw__a" href="https://vidviday.ua/blog/en/dovbush-rocks-carpathian-mountains/">vidviday.ua</a> says the volcanic giant stones once rested at the bottom of the ancient sea. They are now surrounded by green forests. Named a national monument in 1981, they are seen as a "place of power" and are popular with visitors seeking a mystical experience.</p>
<p>The rocks are named after Oleksa Dovbush, a Robin Hood-like figure, who used them as a hideout in the 18th century. As a leader of a group of rebels, he fought against the oppressive forces that ruled the area. The rocky terrain, with its numerous caves and narrow passages, provided the perfect refuge for Dovbush and his followers.</p>
<p>Ancient storytellers said that Oleksa was killed by the husband of his former lover Dzvinka, who turned into a rock for her betrayal. And Oleksa's body was dismembered and spread throughout the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Visiting Dovbush Rocks</strong></p>
<p>Last summer I visited this mysterious place with my students from the Lyceum of Otyniia, a school for students ages six to 17. The energy of this place is impossible to forget. We felt there was a special force that inspired us to do great things and build our inner strength.</p>
<p>The path through the cave is so narrow that, at times, it may seem that there is no way out. In some places, the distance between the rocks is very narrow, only 20 to 30 centimeters wide. In the caves between the rocks, it gets darker and you can hear the rustling of bats' wings and the echo of dripping water.</p>
<p>Above the cave is an unusual rock in the image of a lion. Visitors can climb on top of the lion to see the beautiful view of Prykarpattia and look for their hopes and dreams on a "wishing stone."</p>
<p>According to folk legend, the lion is there to guard Dovbush's buried treasure which no one has been able to find yet. It is said that after Dovbush's death, his fellow rebels hid gold taken from tavern keepers and merchants in the Odynets cave. The entry to the cave is covered by a rotating stone. One needs to say a magic word to turn the stone and open a passage to the cave. The person who knew that magic word died long ago. So the gold has been lying under the rock for more than a hundred years.</p>
<p>Another mysterious place is Devil's Gorge. Only 20 centimeters wide, the gorge is difficult to get through. People put a lot of effort into getting through this narrow gap because, as legend has it, they could be set free of sin.</p>
<p>For Ukrainians, Dovbush Rocks represents both the power of nature and the resilience of the human spirit. The rock formation inspires us to rethink our place in nature, and our culture and history. It is a beautiful place where everyone should experience all its magic for themselves.</p>

            <title>Europe’s Digital Act Forces Tech Companies to Change  (2024/3/10)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">09 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Europeans can now choose what online services, including <strong>browsers</strong> and search engines, to use for their mobile phones and computers. They can also choose where to download iPhone <strong>apps</strong> and how their personal online data is used.</p>
<p>They are part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA is a set of European Union laws that six large technology companies had to start following recently. Those companies include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta, and TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>The DMA is the latest in a series of laws that Europe has passed as a world leader in controlling large tech companies. The companies have followed by changing long-held ways of doing business. For example, Apple will permit people to download smartphone apps outside of its App Store.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Google's first datacenter in Germany is pictured during its inauguration in Hanau near Frankfurt, Germany, Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/397c0153-2ef3-41fe-9ff6-b68ff64c19bb_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Google's first datacenter in Germany is pictured during its inauguration in Hanau near Frankfurt, Germany, Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)</span></div>
<p>Here's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:</p>
<p><strong>What companies have to follow the rules?</strong></p>
<p>Some 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media companies, fall under the DMA.</p>
<p>They include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and the Android operating system. Others are the online store Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari browser and operating system iOS.</p>
<p>Meta's social media and messaging sites Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's operating system Windows and social media site LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The companies face the threat of large fines of up to 20 percent of their yearly worldwide income for repeated violations. That could amount to billions of dollars. And they also face the threat of a breakup for major violations.</p>
<p><strong>What effect will the rules have around the world?</strong></p>
<p>Zach Meyers is an assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a research organization. He said, "If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA..."</p>
<p>Already, countries like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, and India are writing their own versions of DMA-like rules. The aim is to prevent tech companies from having too much control over online markets.</p>
<p><strong>How will downloading apps change?</strong></p>
<p>In one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes with its devices.</p>
<p>Apple has long opposed such a move. A large part of its income comes from the 30 percent charge it demands for payments made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that downloading apps outside of its store will come with added security risks.</p>
<p>Now, Apple is cutting those charges for developers in Europe that choose to stay with its payment-processing system. But Apple is adding a 55-cent fee for each iOS app downloaded through outside app stores. Critics say that will persuade existing free apps to not use outside stores.</p>
<p>Avery Gardiner is a director at the music company Spotify. She said those outside app stores will never grow because they will be missing many apps that would need to be there for people to want to use those stores.</p>
<p><strong>How will people get more choices online?</strong></p>
<p>Users of mobile devices will have more choices online.</p>
<p>They will not be forced to use certain services like Apple's Safari browser or Google search engine. Android users can choose which search engine to use, and iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their main one. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.</p>
<p>Some Google search results will show up differently because the DMA bans companies from giving <strong>preference</strong> to their own services. So, for example, searches for hotels will now show a list of <strong>booking</strong> sites like Expedia.</p>
<p>Users can also stop companies from using their online data to target them with advertising.</p>
<p>The DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other.</p>
<p>Meta owns two messaging apps that fall under the rules. So it is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can send messages, videos, and images to each other.</p>

<p>Researchers have used radar and other technologies to study a large "star" sand <strong>dune</strong> in eastern Morocco. The team said it was able to capture detailed data on how these dunes form and develop.</p>
<p>A star dune is named after its shape because it can look like a star when seen from above. These structures are very large and have a hill, or peak, at the top. They have large masses, called arms, spreading out from the peak. Star dunes are shaped by wind and other conditions in the environment.</p>
<p>Star dunes are common in deserts and can be found in Africa, the Middle East, China and North America. But scientists say, although there are a lot of star dunes, the formations have not been studied very much so far.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A view of the Lala Lallia star dune of the Sahara Desert, in Erg Chebbi, Morocco, as seen in an undated handout image from 2008 and obtained by Reuters on March 1, 2024.

(Charlie Bristow/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The new study – believed to be the first of its kind – was led by two British researchers. It examines a large star dune in the Sahara Desert's Erg Chebbi sand sea in Morocco. The research results recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53485-3">appeared</a> in the publication <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>
<p>The scientists said the star dune rises 100 meters above surrounding dunes and is 700 meters wide. The structure contains an estimated five-and-a-half metric tons of sand.</p>
<p>The researchers used radar that can "see" underground to look at different elements within the star dune. The science instruments that were used are designed to map all layers within the dunes. They also used a method called <strong>luminescence</strong> dating to study the age of the dune. This method uses minerals in the sand to estimate when they last received sunlight in an attempt to guess the age of the dune.</p>
<p>Geoff Duller is a professor of geography and earth sciences at Britain's Aberystwyth University. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2024/03/title-269226-en.html">said</a> in a statement the new technology had finally made it possible to study these large dunes. "It's only because of new technology that we can start to uncover their secrets," Duller said.</p>
<p>The researchers estimated the oldest parts of the base of the star dune are about 13,000 years old. And the dune is moving across the desert at a rate of about 50 centimeters a year. The team noted the star dune experienced the most growth during the past 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Star dunes make up just 10 percent of all dunes in Earth's deserts. They have also been observed on Mars and on Saturn's moon Titan.</p>
<p>Earth's largest star dunes are found in western China's Badain Jaran desert. Star dunes also are found in places including the Namib Sand Sea in Namibia, large sand seas in Algeria and Rub' al Khali in Saudi Arabia. In North America, Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado contains a series of them.</p>
<p>"I first encountered star dunes in Namibia 20 years ago," Duller told Reuters news agency. He added that he still has clear memories of being surprised at the size and beauty of the first sand dunes he saw. "I have a <strong>vivid</strong> memory of the long climb to the top, struggling up very loose sand in the heat of the day."</p>

            <title>Are Student-athletes Considered College Employees?  (2024/3/10)</title>

<p>The Dartmouth College men's basketball team voted to join a labor organization, called a union, this week.</p>
<p>The move means that the student-athletes on the team could have the right to negotiate a working contract like other university employees.</p>
<p>In an election held by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the team members voted 13-2 to join Service Employees International Union Local 560. The same union also represents some workers at Dartmouth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A student walks near the Alumni Gymnasium on the campus of Dartmouth College, Tuesday, March 5, 2024, in Hanover, N.H. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/dd226cf9-e035-4344-9bf4-8bdce29beaf2_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A student walks near the Alumni Gymnasium on the campus of Dartmouth College, Tuesday, March 5, 2024, in Hanover, N.H. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)</span></div>
<p>Cade Haskins and Romeo Myrthil are Dartmouth basketball players. The student-athletes said of the vote, "... we, as students, can also be both <strong>campus</strong> workers and union members. Dartmouth seems to be stuck in the past. It's time for the age of <strong>amateurism</strong> to end."</p>
<p>However, the school in Hanover, New Hampshire has already appealed the local NLRB decision. In a statement, Dartmouth said, "<strong>Classifying</strong> these students as employees simply because they play basketball is as <strong>unprecedented</strong> as it is inaccurate."</p>
<p>The school also warned the students that unionizing could get the team removed from athletic competition.</p>
<p>Both sides have until March 12 to file objections with the NLRB. The case could also end up in federal court, which would likely delay the outcome for some time.</p>
<p>The Dartmouth vote is the latest effort by student-athletes to unionize and gain money and other rights in exchange for many hours spent practicing and playing sports.</p>
<p>In 2015, a local NLRB blocked an attempt by students on the football team at Northwestern University in Illinois to form a union. But the decision did not directly answer the question of whether student-athletes are employees.</p>
<p><strong>Growth of college sports</strong></p>
<p>The history of college students playing sports for their school goes back over 100 years.</p>
<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA, is the governing body for college sports. The organization has long said that its players are "student-athletes" who go to school mainly to study.</p>
<p>At first, students were not paid to play sports and were considered "amateurs." Gradually, student-athletes from large universities started receiving money for housing, food and <strong>tuition</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent years, American television networks have spent more money to broadcast college sports around the country and the world. The Big Ten, an athletic organization with college teams from the New York area to Los Angeles, reached an agreement in 2022 to broadcast its football and basketball games for $7 billion.</p>
<p>As college sports became popular, teams from large universities now regularly play in front of large crowds of up to 100,000 people. And some student-athletes have become even better known than professional athletes.</p>
<p>In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA could not prevent college athletes from getting paid by outside groups in return for the use of their name or image.</p>
<p>That opened the door for some college athletes to make lots of money. This year, one top student-athlete is Caitlin Clark, a basketball player at the University of Iowa. She set college scoring records and reportedly earns nearly $1 million a year for the use of her name and image.</p>
<p>The Dartmouth basketball players will never be famous enough to make that kind of money. One student-athlete said what he really wants from the union push is to get access to better healthcare so he can heal his basketball injuries.</p>
<p><strong>What about Dartmouth?</strong></p>
<p>Tony Clark is the head of the Major League Baseball Players Association. He said the vote gives the Dartmouth basketball players "a seat at the table and powerful voice."</p>
<p>One basketball coach whose team is very well known – Dan Hurley of the University of Connecticut – said some kind of union or players' organization is the future of college sports.</p>
<p>"These players are putting in <strong>incredible</strong> work days, work weeks for five, six months," he said. "I think there's so much there that's going to have to be settled."</p>
<p>A 2015 legal case suggested athletes like the basketball players can spend up to 40 hours per week involved in their sports activities, leaving little time for study or work.</p>
<p>Haskins said he loves playing basketball. But he has had serious injuries to his ankle, hip and shoulder while playing. "It is definitely a <strong>burden</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Union interest among younger workers is growing, says the Economic Policy Institute. Workers under 45 joined unions at <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.epi.org/publication/union-membership-data/" target="_blank">the highest rate in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Myrthil said he will talk about the union with new students who are coming next year. "We'll introduce them to the idea and what it means," he said. "And then hopefully it gets passed on."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about trying something new or something you are unsure about.</p>
<p>People can react differently to these kinds of situations. Some people may want to <u>jump right in feet first</u>. They may want to <u>take the plunge! </u></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Triathletes dive into The Seine river with the Eiffel Tower in the background during the men's 2023 World Triathlon Olympic Games Test Event in Paris. (Photo by Bertrand GUAY / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-116f-08dba014e0b4_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Triathletes dive into The Seine river with the Eiffel Tower in the background during the men's 2023 World Triathlon Olympic Games Test Event in Paris.

<p>And some people may want <u>to test the waters</u>. They may want to <u>dip their toes in </u>first.</p>
<p>Which kind of person are you? Well, imagine you are standing on the edge of a lake or swimming pool. You want to get into the water, but you don't know the water's temperature.</p>
<p>Do you jump right in? If you do, you may be more bold and adventurous.</p>
<p>Or do you want to dip a toe into the water before you decide? If so, you may be more <strong>cautious </strong>and careful.</p>
<p>If you dip your toes into something, you start doing it slowly and carefully. You are not sure if you will like it. You want to test the waters before beginning something, or before taking the plunge.</p>
<p>Testing the waters means you get a feel for something before committing to it. For example, if you want to move to a new city, you probably want to test the waters first by going there for a short stay.</p>
<p>Taking the plunge is the opposite of dipping your toes. When you take the plunge, you jump right into something. You do not wait or <strong>hesitate.</strong></p>
<p>We use the expression <u>dip your toes in </u>for many situations. You may want to try an activity briefly to find out if you like it first. It can also mean you start something very carefully before becoming involved in something that you are not experienced at.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear some of these expressions used in a non-water related situation.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, I'm going ballroom dancing this Saturday. Do you want to join me?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Ballroom dancing? I know nothing about ballroom dancing. </em></p>
<p><em>A: That's fine! This place I found is perfect for you. Before the dance starts, they give a free class to beginners.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'll just go and watch. You know ... dip my toes in. I like to know what I'm getting into first.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Sure. But I promise you ... after the first 5 minutes you are going to want to jump in feet first!</em></p>
<p>That is all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>If you are new to VOA Learning English, there's no need to dip your toes in first. Just take the plunge! Visit our website to find more stories.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>Russia and China are considering putting a nuclear power station on the moon in about 10 years.<br/>
俄罗斯和中国正在考虑在大约10年后将核电站送上月球。</p>
<p>The head of Russia's space agency Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, made the statement recently. He added that such a project could support the building of moon settlements one day.<br/>
俄罗斯航天局局长尤里·鲍里索夫最近发表了上述声明。他补充说，这种项目有一天可以支持月球基地的建设。</p>
<p>Borisov said that Russia and China had been working on a moon program together. The former deputy defense minister explained that Russia was able to help with its expertise in "nuclear space energy."<br/>
鲍里索夫说，俄罗斯和中国一直在共同致力于月球计划。这位前国防部副部长解释说，俄罗斯能够利用其在“太空核能”方面的专业知识提供帮助。</p>
<p>"Today we are seriously considering a project - somewhere at the turn of 2033-2035 - to deliver and install a power unit on the lunar surface together with our Chinese colleagues," Borisov said.<br/>
鲍里索夫说：“今天，我们正在认真考虑一个项目——在2033至2035年左右——与中国同行一起在月球表面交付和安装发电机组。”</p>
<p>Solar panels would not be able to provide enough electricity to power future moon settlements, he said, while nuclear power could.<br/>
他说，太阳能电池板无法为未来的月球基地提供足够电力，而核电可以。</p>
<p>He said the possible plan should be done "without the presence of humans."<br/>
他说，这项可能的计划应该在“无人在场的情况下”完成。</p>
<p>Borisov also spoke about Russian plans to build a nuclear-powered spaceship to carry cargo. He said all the technical questions concerning the project had been solved, except for finding out how to cool the nuclear reactor.<br/>
鲍里索夫还谈到了俄罗斯建造核动力飞船运载货物的计划。他说，除了找出如何冷却核反应堆的办法之外，有关该项目的所有技术问题都已解决。</p>
<p>He said the ship would be a large "structure that would be able, thanks to a nuclear reactor and ... high-power turbines...to transport large cargoes from one orbit to another." He added that such a ship could collect objects for many other projects.<br/>
他说，这艘飞船将是一个大型“结构，由于有核反应堆和大功率涡轮机，将能够将大型货物从一个轨道运输到另一个轨道。”他补充说，这艘飞船可以为许多其他项目收集物体。</p>
<p>Russian officials have spoken before about plans to mine minerals on the moon. But the Russian space program has suffered a series of problems in recent years.<br/>
俄罗斯官员此前曾谈到在月球上开采矿产的计划。但近年来，俄罗斯的太空计划遇到了一系列问题。</p>
<p>Its first moon mission in 47 years failed last year after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft lost control and crashed.<br/>
去年，在俄罗斯的月球-25号宇宙飞船失控坠毁后，其47年来的首次月球任务失败了。</p>
<p>Russian officials have said they will launch further lunar missions and then explore the possibility of a joint Russian-China crewed mission and even a lunar base.<br/>
俄罗斯官员表示，他们将进一步发动月球任务，然后探索俄中联合载人任务甚至月球基地的可能性。</p>
<p>Last month, China said it aimed to put the first Chinese astronaut on the moon before 2030.<br/>
中国上月表示计划在2030年前将首位中国宇航员送上月球。</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin last month said a warning by the United States that Russia planned to put nuclear weapons in space was false. Putin said the warning was part of a plan to force Russia into arms negotiations on the West's terms.<br/>

<p>In many movies, the clothing the actors wear is an important part of the story. In Rome, there is a workshop that has been a big part of Italian and international film history for 60 years.</p>
<p>Tirelli Costumes in Rome's Prati neighborhood is an <strong>atelier</strong>, a business that makes special clothing and costumes. It has earned the <strong>nickname</strong> the "Oscar tailor's shop" for its work in film costume design. An "Oscar" is another name for an award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Umberto Tirelli started the shop in November 1964. It has been behind 17 Academy Awards for best costume design. Most recently, its workers helped create the costumes for Ridley Scott's movie <em>Napoleon</em>. The film's costume designers were nominated for an Oscar that will be decided at the Academy Awards in Hollywood this weekend.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Amadeus dress by Milos Forman is displayed at the Tirelli Atelier in Rome, Tuesday, March 5, 2024.

<p>"Maybe it will win! Let's add another medal to the medal collection," the shop's current head, Dino Trappetti, told <em>The Associated Press</em>. "Of course, the Oscar is not won by the tailor's shop, the Oscar is won by the costume designer. But the tailor's shop has the <strong>merit</strong> and the honor of having participated to make it win."</p>
<p>The beginning of the atelier started with Tirelli's passion for collecting old clothes. He searched for clothing in houses of <strong>nobility</strong> and <strong>flea markets</strong> worldwide. He slowly built a collection that now has more than 15,000 real pieces of clothing that date from 1750 to 1980.</p>
<p>At the start, the shop had "a <strong>sewing</strong> machine, two cutters and two other <strong>seamstresses</strong>," Trappetti said.</p>
<p>Today, the headquarters of Tirelli Costumes has <strong>mannequins</strong> wearing some of the atelier's most famous creations: A pink flowered outfit that actor Tom Hulce wore as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in <em>Amadeus</em>, and the red outfit Michelle Pfeiffer wore in <em>The Age of Innocence</em>. The designers of each of those pieces of clothing won Oscars.</p>
<p>After the 1984 costume design Oscar for <em>Amadeus</em>, Tirelli could have accepted many international projects "because the market was immediately interested," Trappetti said. But Tirelli, who died in 1990, was not sure.</p>
<p>Trappetti remembered him saying: "I'm not going to America. If America wants, America will come looking for me."</p>
<p>Over 60 years, the tailor's shop has created more than 300,000 costumes that are now stored near Rome. Costume designers come for ideas and historical information. They also come for hand-cut, hand-sewn creations by the team of Tirelli workers.</p>
<p>"You can't make those costumes in a factory. In a factory you can make films with robots, futuristic or <strong>fantasy</strong>," Trappetti said. "But these things have to be made by hand."</p>

<p>
<em>We continue the story of "The Open Boat" by Stephen Crane. As we told you last week, the story is based on true events. In eighteen ninety-six, Crane was traveling to Cuba as a news reporter. On his way there, his ship sank in the Atlantic Ocean. Crane climbed into the last remaining lifeboat.</em></p>
<p><em>Three men got into the boat with him. They were the ship's captain, the cook and a sailor named Billie. For three days, the men steered the small boat through high waves along the coast of Florida. At last, they saw land. Here is Shep O'Neal with the final part of the story.</em></p>
<p>A long stretch of coast lay before the eyes of the men. Slowly, the land rose up out of the mountainous sea. The men could see a small house against the sky. To the south, they could see a lighthouse. Tide, wind and waves were pushing the lifeboat northward. The men thought someone on land would have seen the boat by now.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Open Boat Part Two" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/0334B585-D474-47D2-A875-420BF2D17277_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Open Boat Part Two</span></div>
<p>"Well," said the captain, "I suppose we'll have to attempt to reach the shore ourselves. If we stay out here too long, none of us will have the strength left to swim after the boat sinks."</p>
<p>So Billie the sailor turned the boat straight for the shore.</p>
<p>"If we don't all get ashore," said the captain, "I suppose you fellows know where to send news of my death?"</p>
<p>The men then exchanged some information. There was a great deal of anger in them. They thought: "If I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I permitted to come this far and think about sand and trees?"</p>
<p>The waves grew stronger. They seemed always just about to break and roll over the little boat. The coast was still far away. The sailor said: "Boys, the boat won't live three minutes more, and we're too far out to swim. Shall I take her to sea again, captain?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Go ahead!" said the captain. The sailor turned the boat and took her safely out to sea again.</p>
<p>"It's funny those life-saving people haven't seen us," one of the men said.</p>
<p>"Maybe they think we're out here for sport! Maybe they think we're fishing. Maybe they think we're fools."</p>
<p>Once more, the sailor <strong>rowed</strong> the boat and then the reporter rowed. Suddenly, they saw a man walking along the shore.</p>
<p>The man stopped walking. He moved his hand in the air to wave at them. He saw them! Now he was running to the house.</p>
<p>The captain tied a cloth to a stick and waved it. Now there was another man on the shore. The two men waved their hands in the air, as if they were saying hello to the men in the boat.</p>
<p>Now, what was that moving on the shore? It was a bus – a hotel bus. A man stood on the steps of the bus and waved his coat over his head. The men in the boat wondered what he wanted to say. Was he attempting to tell them something? Should they wait for help? Should they go north? Should they go south?</p>
<p>The men waited and waited but nothing happened. The sun began to go down. It got dark and cold. They could no longer see anyone on the beach.</p>
<p>The sailor rowed, and then the reporter rowed, and then the sailor rowed again. They rowed and rowed through the long night. The land had disappeared but they could hear the low sound of the waves hitting the shore. This was surely a quiet night.</p>
<p>The cook finally spoke: "Billie, what kind of pie do you like best?"</p>
<p>"Pie," said the sailor and the reporter angrily. "Don't talk about those things!"</p>
<p>"Well," said the cook, "I was just thinking about ham sandwiches, and ..."</p>
<p>A night on the sea in an open boat is a long night. The sailor continued to row until his head fell forward and sleep overpowered him. Then he asked the reporter to row for a while. They exchanged places so the sailor could sleep in the bottom of the boat with the cook and the captain.</p>
<p>The reporter thought that he was the one man <strong>afloat</strong> on all the oceans in the world. The wind had a sad voice as it came over the waves.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a long, loud swishing sound behind the boat and a shining trail of silvery blue. It might have been made by a huge knife. Then there was another swish and another long flash of bluish light, this time alongside the boat. The reporter saw a huge fin speed like a shadow through the water, leaving a long glowing trail. The thing kept swimming near the boat. He noted its speed and power. The reporter wished the men would wake up. He did not want to be alone with the <strong>shark</strong>.</p>
<p>The reporter thought as he rowed. He was angry that they had come so close to land and yet might still die at sea. Then he remembered a poem that he had learned as a child. It was a poem about a soldier of the French Foreign Legion. The soldier lay dying in Algiers. Just before he died, he cried out: "I shall never see my own, my native land." And now, many years after he had learned this poem, the reporter for the first time understood the sadness of the dying soldier.</p>
<p>Hours passed. The reporter asked the sailor to take the oars so that he could rest. It seemed like only a brief period, but it was more than an hour later, when the sailor returned the oars to the reporter. They both knew that only they could keep the boat from sinking. And so they rowed, hour after hour, through the night.</p>
<p>When day came, the four men saw land again. But there were no people on the shore. A conference was held on the boat.</p>
<p>"Well," said the captain, "if no help is coming, we might better try to reach the shore right away. If we stay out here much longer, we will be too weak to do anything for ourselves at all."</p>
<p>The others agreed. They began to turn the boat toward the beach. The captain told them to be careful – that when the boat came near the beach, the waves would sink it. Then everyone should jump out of the boat and swim to the shore.</p>
<p>As the boat came closer to land, the waves got bigger and more violent. At last, a large wave climbed into the air and fell on the small boat with great force.</p>
<p>The boat turned over as the men jumped into the sea. The water was like ice. The reporter was tired. But he swam toward the beach. He looked for his friends.</p>
<p>He saw Billie, the sailor, in front of him, swimming strongly and quickly. The cook was near him. Behind, the captain held on to the overturned boat with his one good hand. Soon, the reporter could swim no longer. A current was carrying him back out to sea. He thought: "Am I going to drown? Can it be possible?"</p>
<p>But the current suddenly changed and he was able to swim toward the shore. The captain called to him to swim to the boat and hold on. The reporter started to swim toward the boat. Then he saw a man running along the shore. He was quickly taking off his shoes and clothes.</p>
<p>As the reporter got close to the boat, a large wave hit him and threw him into the air over the boat and far from it. When he tried to get up, he found that the water was not over his head, only half way up his body. But he was so tired that he could not stand up. Each wave threw him down, and the current kept pulling him back to sea.</p>
<p>Then he saw the man again, jumping into the water. The man pulled the cook to the shore. Then he ran back into the water for the captain. But the captain waved him away and sent him to the reporter. The man seized the reporter's hand and pulled him to the beach. Then the man pointed to the water and cried: "What's that?"</p>
<p>In the shallow water, face down, lay Billie, the sailor.</p>
<p>The reporter did not know all that happened after that. He fell on the sand as if dropped from a housetop. It seems that immediately the beach was filled with men with blankets, clothes and whiskey. Women brought hot coffee. The people welcomed the men from the sea to the land.</p>
<p>But a still and dripping shape was carried slowly up the beach. And the land's welcome for the sailor's body could only be its final resting place. When night came, the white waves moved in the moonlight. The wind brought the sound of the great sea's voice to the men on the shore.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Al.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Hi, hello</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="'Yet'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-8c17-08dc3d3702a9_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">'Yet'</span></div>
<p>My name is Al from Indonesia. I am still not sure how to use the word "yet" in a sentence, <strong>positive</strong> or <strong>negative</strong>.</p>
<p>Would you like to inform us more about that?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Al.</p>
<p>We have talked about how to use the word "yet" in comparison to "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/already-or-yet-/6878196.html" target="_blank">already</a>" and "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/still-and-yet-/6818661.html" target="_blank">still</a>" in earlier <em>Ask a Teacher</em> articles. Now, let's talk about "yet" by itself.</p>
<p>"Yet" is almost always used as an adverb of time. It means from some time in the past until now. "Yet" is used in both positive and negative sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Yes-No Questions</strong></p>
<p>In spoken English, "yet" is often used in both yes or no questions. For example,</p>
<p><em>Have you heard from your boss <u>yet</u>?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you finish your homework <u>yet</u>?</em></p>
<p>We can ask these questions without "yet". Why use it then?</p>
<p>When we add "yet" to a question, we not only want to know if it happened, but we expect it to happen. And, we want it to happen.</p>
<p>We can use yet with negative questions, too. For example,</p>
<p><em>Have you not heard from your boss <u>yet</u>?</em></p>
<p><em>Have you not finished your homework <u>yet</u>?</em></p>
<p>Using a negative question expresses an even stronger expectation or desire, almost disbelief that something has not happened "yet!"</p>
<p><strong>Statements</strong></p>
<p>Most statements with "yet" are negative, especially in informal spoken language.</p>
<p><em>But you don't have to make a decision <u>yet</u>.</em></p>
<p><em>We are not there <u>yet</u>.</em></p>
<p>In these negative statements, "yet" expresses an expectation that it will happen at some point in the future.</p>
<p>We hope this explanation has helped you, Al.</p>

<p>And that's <em>Ask a Teacher</em>.</p>

            <title>Miami Beach Adding More Security Measures for Spring Break  (2024/3/8)</title>

<p>The American city of Miami Beach, Florida is a popular destination for travelers during school break periods in spring. But, in the last three years, the area has dealt with high levels of violent crime during spring break.</p>
<p>So, city officials are putting in place new security measures.</p>
<p>The measures include parking restrictions for non-<strong>residents</strong> and closings of outdoor restaurants on busy weekends. The city has warned visitors to expect curfews, personal property searches at the beach, early beach closures, road security checkpoints, and arrests for drug possession and violence.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Miami Beach park rangers watch over crowds Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024, in Miami Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-715d-08dc3dfbb98b_cx0_cy10_cw99_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Miami Beach park rangers watch over crowds Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024, in Miami Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)</span></div>
<p>Civil rights activists say the restrictions are an overreaction to large crowds of Black people. And, business owners in the city's famous South Beach neighborhood argue that the new measures will cause them financial loss during one of the busiest times of the year.</p>
<p>Miami Beach has ordered such measures before, so the restrictions are not unfamiliar to the area. But, this is the first time the rules have been established ahead of the season.</p>
<p>Steven Meiner is the mayor of Miami Beach. "The <strong>status quo</strong> and what we've seen in the last few years is just not acceptable," he said.</p>
<p>Meiner said spring break crowds get out of control even with a strong police presence. He said the island city can only hold so many people. And the amount of people has often gone beyond what is safe.</p>
<p>Local business owner, David Wallack, opposes the measures. He said the city has always been a place of celebration. And he argued that limits on the numbers of visitors will turn the city into a retirement community.</p>
<p>Wallack and others have proposed holding a music <strong>festival</strong> during the third week of spring break, the season's busiest time. Supporters say such an event would help prevent the gathering of mobs.</p>
<p>But, Meiner said the city has spent millions of dollars on musical performances and similar events in the past. He said such offerings did not prevent violence well. He said businesses suffer when violent crowds gather and force them to close. And, he said the people causing most of the problems are not spending money in the city anyway.</p>
<p>Some civil rights supporters, however, believe the restrictions are racist.</p>
<p>South Beach became popular among Black tourists about 20 years ago because of an event called Urban Beach Week. It takes place in late May during the Memorial Day holiday. Many locals have protested about violence and other crime connected to the event. Officials increased police presence during Memorial Day as a result.</p>
<p>Stephen Hunter Johnson is an attorney and member of Miami-Dade's Black Affairs Advisory Board. He said city officials are only cracking down so hard because many of the visitors are Black.</p>
<p>"Everybody loves this idea that they are free from the government <strong>intruding</strong> on them," Johnson said. "But amazingly, if the government intrudes on Black people, everyone's fine with it."</p>
<p>But Meiner rejects the idea that the city's actions have anything to do with race.</p>
<p>"I have a moral <strong>obligation</strong> to keep people safe, and right now, it is not safe," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Four-year-old Omar Abu Kuwaik is from the Gaza Strip, but in the last several weeks, he has spent time in Egypt, New York City, and Philadelphia before returning to Egypt.</p>
<p>Why did he travel so far from home?</p>
<p>He came for medical operations on his skin and to receive a <strong>prosthetic</strong> arm.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Omar Abu Kuwaik throws snow shortly after arriving from Gaza at the residence of the Global Medical Relief Fund as Khaolah Obahi of Rahma Worldwide looks on, Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024.

<p>He is one of the few Gazans to have made it out of the war <strong>zone</strong>. But his family was not so lucky.</p>
<p>Omar was wounded during an Israeli airstrike in December that also killed a number of his family members, including his parents and a sister.</p>
<p><strong>‘Anywhere is better'</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>charity</strong> group called the Global Medical Relief Fund found out about Omar and provided for his medical care in the U.S. Elissa Montanti started the organization. She has spent 25 years getting hundreds of children free medical care after they lost arms and legs to wars or disasters, including wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Montanti said she knew she would have to help the Gazan children when the conflict started between Hamas and Israel last October. But, she wondered, "How? How will I ever get these kids out when they can't even get out of Gaza?'"</p>
<p>Another group, Rahma Worldwide, a U.S.-based charity, learned about Omar's injuries. The group got him and his aunt into Egypt, provided them with new passports and airplane tickets to the United States in January.</p>
<p>Omar was getting only simple medical care in Gaza.</p>
<p>Adib Chouiki is vice president of Rahma Worldwide. Chouiki knew his group needed to get the boy to a place where he could get help.</p>
<p>"Our view was, anywhere is better for him than being in Gaza," Chouiki said.</p>
<p>The United Nations says there are many more men, women and children like Omar waiting for medical care. About 4,000 wounded people and their families – such as Omar's aunt – have been permitted to leave Gaza to get medical help. But the U.N. refugee agency says there are still 8,000 people on a medical waiting list.</p>
<p>Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by the territory's Hamas rulers, said 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, and 70,000 wounded. The ministry said about two-thirds of those killed have been women and children.</p>
<p><strong>To the United States</strong></p>
<p>Omar went with his aunt, Maha on a flight from Egypt to New York City. Maha left her husband and children behind in Gaza.</p>
<p>Along the way, Omar saw the airline pilots getting ready to start the flight and he said, "When I grow up, I want to be a pilot, so I can bring people places."</p>
<p>Once in the U.S., the Global Medical Relief Fund sent Omar to Shriners Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for treatment. He received pieces of new skin, called grafts, to repair the burns on his leg. Medical workers also fitted him for a prosthetic arm.</p>

<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.C.) is looking to expand operations to dig, or <strong>drill</strong>, for oil. The central African country is known for its mineral riches. Currently, drilling is limited to just a small area along the Atlantic Ocean and out in the water. But that is expected to change if the government carries out its plan to sell 30 pieces of land for oil and gas exploration across the country.</p>
<p>Leaders say the plan will grow the economy. They say such growth is necessary for the poor people of Congo. But communities, rights groups, and environmentalist groups warn that expanded drilling will harm the environment and human health.</p>
<p>In the Moanda area of the D.R.C., locals say pollution has worsened since a French company began drilling there in 2000. They say spills and leaks from operations are destroying the soil. The work includes "flaring" --- the burning of natural gas near drilling sites. Locals report that the flaring is dirtying the air they breathe. Flaring is also wasteful as the energy goes unused.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Children sit inside a fishing boat outside a mangrove in Kimpozia village, one of the areas auctioned for oil drilling, in Moanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Monday, Dec. 25, 2023.

<p>And, critics say, the Congolese government does not supervise the oil drilling operations well enough.</p>
<p>The company, Perenco, says it follows accepted international measures in its <strong>extraction</strong> methods. It said its operation does not create health risks and that any pollution it causes is low-level. The company also said it offered to support a power plant that would make use of the natural gas and reduce flaring that way.</p>
<p>The government did not respond to questions about the proposed plant.</p>
<p>Congo's minister overseeing oil and gas, Didier Budimbu, said the government plans to protect the environment.</p>
<p>Natural areas in Congo, including the Congo Basin rainforest, capture large amounts of carbon dioxide – about 1.5 billion tons a year, or about 3 percent of what the world produces each year. More than 12 of the extraction areas for sale include land in government-protected wild areas.</p>
<p>The government said the 27 properties for sale hold an estimated 22 billion <strong>barrels </strong>of oil. Environmental groups say that selling more land to drill would have harmful effects in the D.R.C. and in other countries.</p>
<p>"Any new oil and gas project, anywhere in the world, is fueling the climate and nature crisis that we're in," said Mbong Akiy Fokwa Tsafak, program director for Greenpeace Africa. She said Perenco's operations have done nothing in respect to the poor and instead harm the environment and the lives of communities.</p>
<p>Environmentalists say Congo has a strong possibility to instead develop renewable energy.</p>
<p>Budimbu said now is not the time to move away from <strong>fossil fuels</strong> when the country still depends on them. He said the D.R.C. will move away from fossil fuel dependency over the long term.</p>
<p>Perenco has faced criticism for years. Local researchers, aid groups, and Congo's Senate have made multiple reports of pollution dating back more than ten years. Two organizations, Sherpa and Friends of the Earth France, opened a legal action against the company in 2022, accusing Perenco of polluting.</p>
<p>Adore Ngaka's lives in the village of Tshiende. Oil drills can be seen up the road from his home. Ngaka says they remind him every day of all that he has lost. The extraction processes have polluted the soil, hurt his crops, and forced the family to use all their savings to survive, he said.</p>
<p>He pointed to an ear of corn he grew. The 27-year-old farmer said the vegetable is about half the size of those that grew before the drilling began ten years ago.</p>
<p>He said, "It's bringing us to poverty."</p>

<span class="datetime">07 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>On today's <em>Everyday Grammar,</em> we are going to look at things that are different from each other: in other words, contrasts.</p>
<p>Let's start:</p>
<p>At the 2024 Grammy awards, one performance got the attention of many different sorts of music fans. It was the country music singer Luke Combs singing with singer and songwriter Tracy Chapman.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-75a2-08dc3dd8ab34_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Together, they sang "Fast Car," a song that had helped Chapman win a Grammy Award in 1989 for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. You can listen to the song <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.grammy.com/videos/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-2024-grammys-performance-66th-annual-grammy-awards?streamUrl=https://nomad-content.grammy.com/pmc/2f/6d/c5/2f6dc584-337d-4a9e-8b03-916f21017e49/tra-apple-hls-acc/0312-cbsperf2-gmypgmbug-tp.m3u8&amp;title=Tracy%20Chapman%20and%20Luke%20Combs%20Perform%20%E2%80%9CFast%20Car%E2%80%9D%20%7C%202024%20GRAMMYs">on the Grammys website</a>.</p>
<p>The song won the Country Music Association Awards prize for Country Song of the Year in 2023. Chapman is the first Black songwriter to win this award. Luke Combs recorded the song in 2023. He invited Chapman to sing it with him at the Grammy awards show in February.</p>
<p><strong>The American Dream</strong></p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will look at some of the words in the song and explore how they tell the story of two people. The two tried to find the American Dream: good jobs, a nice home, and children.</p>
<p>We will especially learn about the meanings of some <strong>indefinite</strong> pronouns and how they can be used to make contrasts.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the song, Chapman sings about going someplace in a fast car:</p>
<p><em>You got a fast car<br/>
I want a ticket to anywhere<br/>
Maybe we make a deal<br/>
Maybe together we can get somewhere<br/>
Anyplace is better<br/>
Starting from zero got nothing to lose<br/>
Maybe we'll make something<br/>
But me myself I got nothing to prove</em></p>
<p><strong>Somewhere and anywhere</strong></p>
<p>In this part, we hear <strong>pairs</strong> of contrasting words. The first pair is "anywhere" and "somewhere." She says she wants a "ticket to anywhere," which means there is no exact place she wants to go. A similar word appears in the line, "Anyplace is better." Then, she says that together, she and her friend with the fast car "can get somewhere." "To get somewhere" means to succeed or reach a goal.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing and something</strong></p>
<p>The next pair of contrasting words is "nothing" and "something." The first expression is that she has "nothing to lose." That means she will not suffer if what she tries to do fails. Again, speaking of what the young <strong>couple</strong> can do together, she sings, "Maybe we'll make something." When we use "something" as an indefinite pronoun, it can mean a thing that is quite good, as in the expression:</p>
<p>That's really something!</p>
<p>Moving on to the next part of the song, we find the singer is working at a low-paying job and wants to escape.</p>
<p><em>You got a fast car<br/>
And I got a plan to get us out of here<br/>
I been working at the <strong>convenience</strong> store<br/>
Managed to save just a little bit of money<br/>
We won't have to drive too far<br/>
Just ‘cross the border and into the city<br/>
You and I can both get jobs<br/>
And finally see what it means to be living</em></p>
<p><strong>Dreams and reality</strong></p>
<p>Tracy Chapman has said she wrote the song about the lives of her parents. As a young couple, they struggled to create the kinds of lives they dreamed of. Listen for the words in the next part that contrast their dream with the reality of living in a shelter – a place for people without a home in which to live:</p>
<p><em>I know things will get better<br/>
You'll find work and I'll get promoted<br/>
We'll move out of the shelter<br/>
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs</em></p>
<p>Finally, we learn through Chapman's song that the young woman did not finish her education because she stayed home to take care of her sick father. The couple seems to continue to struggle in the last part of the song, but they have good memories of their younger years. Listen for the indefinite pronoun "someone" here. To "be someone" means to be an important person.</p>
<p><em>I remember we were driving driving in your car<br/>
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk<br/>
City lights lay out before us<br/>
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br/>
And I had a feeling that I belonged<br/>
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone</em></p>
<p>Listening to Tracy Chapman's song, we find that indefinite pronouns can help express two ideas related to the American Dream: to "make something" and to "be someone."</p>

            <title>Don’t Put Your Wet Phone in Bag of Rice  (2024/3/7) | 手机掉水里怎么办？</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Anyone with a mobile phone has likely dropped it in water or been caught in a rainstorm. And many seem to think that putting a wet phone in a bag of uncooked rice will rescue it.<br/>
人们都有可能会把手机掉进水里或者是淋了暴雨。许多人似乎认为，把弄湿的手机放进一袋米里能够挽救它。</p>
<p>However, Apple recently warned against doing just that. The technology company said it is a bad idea because small particles of rice can get into the phone and cause damage.<br/>
然而，苹果公司最近警告不要这样做。这家科技公司表示，这并非良策，因为碎米会进到手机里并造成损坏。</p>
<p>So what should you do instead?<br/>
那么你应该怎么做呢？</p>
<p>If the phone is dropped in water, dry it with a clean cloth, even a shirt will do. Turn the phone off if you can. Remove its SIM card. Remove the phone's cover. Remove the battery, if possible. And let everything dry at room temperature, perhaps with a fan running.<br/>
如果手机掉在水里，用干净的布擦干，用衣服擦也行。如果可以的话，关掉手机。取出SIM卡。卸下手机外壳。如果可能的话，取下电池。让所有东西在室温下干燥，也许可以打开风扇（加速空气流动）。</p>
<p>Since you cannot take an iPhone apart, Apple says to tap the phone against your hand with the connecting ports facing down so water can flow out.<br/>
苹果公司说，由于你不能拆开iPhone，用手轻轻拍打手机，连接端口朝下，这样水就可以流出。</p>
<p>Samsung, the biggest maker of Android phones, suggests using a cotton swab to get water out of the ports. Apple, however, advises against putting one inside iPhone openings.<br/>
最大的安卓手机制造商三星公司建议用棉签将水从端口中吸出。然而，苹果公司建议不要把棉签插入iPhone手机的端口。</p>
<p>If your phone is dropped in seawater, treated water, or a drink, Samsung advises to keep it in clean water for a few minutes. Doing that will remove any salt or substances that could hurt the phone.<br/>
如果你的手机掉在海水、经过处理的水或饮料中，三星公司建议把手机放在干净的水中泡几分钟。这样做可以去除任何有损手机的盐分或物质。</p>
<p>Both Apple and Samsung say to leave the phone out in an open area to dry. More importantly, do not use a hair dryer or put the phone in a freezer.<br/>
苹果和三星都表示要把手机放在开阔的地方晾干。更重要的是，不要用吹风机吹或将手机放在冰箱里。</p>
<p>Most newer phones are not waterproof but they are water-resistant. It means they can get wet for a short time.<br/>
大多数新手机都不防水，但是能抗水。这意味着它们可能会在短时间内浸湿。</p>
<p>Apple says its newest phones can survive 30 minutes in up to 6 meters of water. Samsung's phones can last for the same amount of time in about 5 meters. But Google advises that all phones lose some water resistance over time.<br/>
苹果公司表示，其最新款手机可以在6米深的水中坚持30分钟。三星的手机可以在大约5米的水中坚持相同的时间。但谷歌建议，随着时间的推移，所有手机都会失去一些抗水性能。</p>
<p>Another way to dry your phone is by using silica gel, a drying agent. Packs of silica gel are usually included with products including food and shoes to keep them dry. These packs can help dry your phone in a sealed container.<br/>
另一种干燥手机的方法是使用硅胶干燥剂。袋装硅胶通常放在食品和鞋子等产品里，以保持其干燥。这些袋装硅胶可以帮助你在密封容器中烘干手机。</p>
<p>The phone manufacturers say it is hard to know when phones are completely dry. But it will likely take a few days. Samsung says it is still a good idea to bring the phone in for service even if you can turn it back on again.<br/>
手机制造商表示，人们很难知道手机什么时候彻底干燥了。但这可能需要几天时间。三星公司表示，即使可以再次开机，最好还是将手机送去维修。</p>

            <title>Virtual Fences for Cows Show Benefits  (2024/3/7)</title>

<span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">06 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>In the American state of Florida, <strong>rancher</strong> Jim Strickland can see his cows at any time, day or night. To do this, all he needs is his phone.</p>
<p>Strickland uses virtual fencing to watch and control the movements of his animals. The system, based on Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology, can help Strickland and researchers improve <strong>grazing</strong> lands, <strong>preserve</strong> wildlife and save time and labor for workers. It can also help improve animal health.</p>
<p>Strickland has been using the system for about six months. He told VOA Learning English he has already seen many good results with the new technology.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cattle wear Vence GPS tracking collars connected to a virtual fence system. (Courtesy photo Merck &amp; Co., Inc.)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-e466-08dc3b075f76_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Cattle wear Vence GPS tracking collars connected to a virtual fence system. (Courtesy photo Merck &amp; Co., Inc.)</span></div>
<p>"It has exceeded by far my expectations."</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>Virtual fencing uses radio signals to make an <strong>invisible</strong> fence. This means you cannot see the fence.</p>
<p>This keeps animals within, or outside of, certain areas. The signals come from nearby mobile phone towers. The signals can also come from base stations that can be moved using a small truck.</p>
<p>Each animal wears a <strong>collar</strong> around its neck. The collar has a radio signal receiver and a <strong>GPS</strong> device that shows the animal's location.</p>
<p>Ranchers train livestock to connect a sound with a small electric shock. When an animal gets close to a virtual fence, its collar makes a warning sound. If the animal moves even closer to the fence, it receives a shock. In this way, livestock quickly learn to stay away from the fence.</p>
<p>Ranchers can change the virtual fence boundaries quickly by using a phone App or computer. And livestock quickly learn the new boundaries.</p>
<p>Strickland and his coworkers can use their phones even while on horseback to move cattle from one area to another. All they need to do is change the virtual fence lines.</p>
<p>"And every 30 minutes, that line will move down; it will literally drive those cows down."</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of virtual fencing </strong></p>
<p>Physical fences take time, labor and money to build. It can be difficult to put them in areas such as rocky and hilly land, wet areas, or places with thick vegetation. Over time, fences need to be fixed or new ones need to be built.</p>
<p>When hurricane Ian hit Florida last year, it destroyed four houses and 45 kilometers of physical fence on the land where Strickland works. But the cell towers for the virtual fence system kept working.</p>
<p>Physical fences can also harm wild animals by making it difficult for them to move within and to areas they need for survival.</p>
<p>The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a U.S-based environmental non-profit organization. It has partnered with cattle ranches in the states of Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado to research the effects of virtual fencing.</p>
<p>William Burnidge is Deputy Director of TNC's North America Regenerative Grazing Lands Strategy. He said that by changing fence boundaries, the systems prevent animals from eating too much vegetation within one area. This helps plants regenerate, or grow again.</p>
<p>He added that virtual fences could help protect rare plants and areas near rivers and streams. They could also support conservation of wild animals, improve the health of animals and help ranch workers have a better quality of life.</p>
<p>Strickland works with partners at Florida Conservation Group and the University of Florida. With virtual fences, they can carefully control grazing. This helps them research the effects of grazing patterns on the growth of young cows, birth rates, and even the effects on nesting birds.</p>
<p>They also plan to research how grazing can affect the release of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere. In Florida and other places, fields are sometimes burned to prepare them for future grazing. The burning releases carbon. Virtual fences may help reduce burning by better controlling where and how long cattle graze.</p>
<p>Both Strickland and Burnidge note that, unlike physical fences, livestock cannot not get injured by a virtual fence.</p>
<p>The GPS collars also let ranchers watch for animals that may be having problems. For example, if the system shows that a cow has not moved for many hours, it may be sick or injured.</p>
<p><strong>Other research and developing countries</strong></p>
<p>In the northwestern state of Oregon, researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Oregon State University studied how virtual fencing can prevent cows from grazing on recently burned land. Cattle can easily damage burned areas and the young plants that grow there.</p>
<p>The Oregon study showed that cows without virtual fence collars ate nearly 70 percent of the plants available to them in a burned area. However, cows with collars spent very little time in the burned area and ate less than three percent of the plants available to them.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing costs</strong></p>
<p>Although virtual fencing systems have benefits, they can be costly. A collar for just one animal can cost around $50 each year or more. And <strong>portable</strong> base stations cost $10,000 or more.</p>
<p>Researchers are looking for ways to lower costs and bring the technology to developing countries.</p>
<p>Last year, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded $9.9 million to Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences to develop low-cost virtual fencing. The university plans to test new systems in Kenya, Mongolia, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>But in some areas, virtual fencing may not be the best solution, Burnidge said. When Burnidge visited Kenya, he saw many workers who closely follow and take care of livestock. Virtual fences could cause some of these workers to lose their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Great interest in the new technology</strong></p>
<p>Still, Burnidge said, many people want to learn more about the technology. "The amount of interest in the ranching community, I've never seen anything comparable," he said.</p>
<p>And Strickland said they are already working on more ways virtual fencing can be used.</p>
<p>"Now we're seeing so many things. Once you start down the road of new technology, then it starts expanding . . . It's like, what can we do next?" he said.</p>

<p>The study, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext">published</a> in the medical publication <em>The Lancet</em>, said that one in eight people are obese. Researchers said around 43 percent of adults were overweight in 2022.</p>
<p>Worldwide, obesity among adults has more than doubled since 1990, the study found. Among young people aged five to 19, the obesity rate increased by four times during the same period.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man walks past the New York Stock Exchange after the close of trading hours in New York City on August 17, 2009.

<p>"A <strong>staggering</strong> number of people are living with obesity," declared the lead writer of the study, Majid Ezzati. He is a professor at Imperial College London.</p>
<p>Severe obesity is strongly linked to a long list of health problems and an early death.</p>
<p>Researchers used data from more than 3,600 population studies involving 222 million people, <em>The Lancet</em> reported. The study "measured height and weight in representative <strong>samples</strong> of the general population," the researchers said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-03-2024-one-in-eight-people-are-now-living-with-obesity">said</a> in a statement that it shared data with other international researchers and helped to create the report.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the study identifies the "importance of preventing and <strong>managing</strong> obesity from early life to adulthood."</p>
<p>The WHO <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-03-2024-one-in-eight-people-are-now-living-with-obesity" target="_blank">noted</a> that at the World Health Assembly in 2022, member states agreed to an agency plan to fight obesity. So far, 31 governments "are now leading the way" to reduce obesity by carrying out goals of the plan.</p>
<p>These include government measures to enact new rules on "harmful" marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children. In addition, governments are aiming to improve school and nutrition policies. They are also seeking price reductions for healthy foods, to increase public awareness about healthy diets and exercise and to strengthen requirements for physical activity in schools.</p>
<p>Imperial College's Ezzati said that obesity rates are not rising in many wealthier nations. But they are quickly increasing in other countries. He noted that some countries have many underweight people, meaning the nations are facing what he called a "double burden" of nutrition problems.</p>
<p>Francesco Branca is head of nutrition at the WHO. He told reporters, "In the past, we have been thinking of obesity as a problem of the rich. Obesity is a problem of the world."</p>
<p>The research represented the first major report on the issue since 2017, with more than 1,500 scientists taking part. That report estimated around 774 million people above the age of five were living with obesity.</p>
<p>Branca and Ezzati suggested that powerful new obesity drugs – such as Ozempic and Wegovy – could be helpful tools in reducing obesity. But they noted that the cost and availability of the drugs might increase inequality.</p>

<span class="byline">By Caty Weaver</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">06 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The only living member of the team to first climb to the top of Mount Everest says the mountain is too crowded and polluted.</p>
<p>Ninety-one-year-old Kanchha Sherpa was part of the team that helped New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reach the<strong> peak</strong> of the world's tallest mountain on May 29, 1953.</p>
<p>Kanchha recently spoke with the<em> Associated Press</em>, saying the 8,849-meter tall mountain must be respected. "They should not be dirtying the mountain. It is our biggest god and they should not be dirtying the gods," he said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kanchha Sherpa speaks to Associated Press during an interview at his home in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, March 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2de955e1-d4bb-4485-a7a7-736b3b87af03_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Kanchha Sherpa speaks to Associated Press during an interview at his home in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, March 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)</span></div>
<p>Since 1953, the mountain has been climbed thousands of times, and it gets more crowded every year.</p>
<p>During the spring climbing season in 2023, 667 climbers got to the top, or summit. And that brought thousands of support workers to Everest base camp between March and May.</p>
<p>"It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers," Kanchha said. "Right now there is always a big crowd of people at the summit."</p>
<p>There have been concerns for years about the number of people living on the mountain for several months and leaving <strong>trash</strong> behind. But officials have no plans to cut down on the number of permits they issue to climbers.</p>
<p>The rules require climbers to bring down their own trash, equipment and everything they carry to the mountain. But <strong>monitoring</strong> of the climbers has not been very effective.</p>
<p>"It is very dirty now. People throw <strong>tins</strong> and <strong>wrappings</strong> after eating food. Who is going to pick them up now?" Kanchha said.</p>
<p>Some climbers just drop their trash in deep openings in the earth on the mountain, he said, noting that the trash is hidden at first. But, he said, in time the trash "will flow down to base camp as the snow melts and carries them downward."</p>
<p>For the Sherpas, Everest is Qomolangma or goddess mother of the world. The mountain is highly honored. And Sherpas generally perform religious services before climbing it.</p>
<p>Kanchha was just a young man when he joined the Hillary-Tenzing climb. He was among the three Sherpas to set up the climb's last camp for Hillary and Tenzing to use.</p>
<p>They heard by radio message that Hillary and Norgay reached the top. Later, the summiteers reunited with the Sherpas at Camp 2.</p>
<p>"We all gathered at Camp 2 but there was no alcohol so we celebrated with tea and <strong>snacks,"</strong> Kanchha said. "We then collected whatever we could and carried it to base camp."</p>
<p>The path they opened up from the base camp to the summit is still used by current climbers.</p>

<p>American educators and lawmakers are calling for complete bans on smartphone use by students in schools.</p>
<p>Most U.S. schools already have rules restricting phone use in class. But administrators and teachers say the measures are difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>Educators across the United States say students are using their phones to do many things that can <strong>distract</strong> their attention during class. These include sending messages, gaming, listening to music, watching videos, checking social media and shopping.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A ninth grader places her cellphone into a phone holder as she enters class at Delta High School, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, in Delta, Utah.

<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/study-number-of-kids-watching-online-videos-doubled-in-4-years/5147205.html">Studies</a> in recent years have confirmed high smartphone usage by young people in America. But an increasing number of educators and experts are now beginning to agree that total bans are necessary to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Leaders and lawmakers in a growing number of states have also called for complete phone bans or suggested new ways to limit their use in class.</p>
<p>James Granger is a science teacher at a Los Angeles, California high school. He recently told <em>The Associated Press</em> (AP), "Students used to have an understanding that you aren't supposed to be on your phone in class. Those days are gone."</p>
<p>Granger requires students attending his class to place their phones in a special container. "The only solution that works is to physically remove the cellphone from the student," Granger said.</p>
<p>The latest state intervention on phones in schools came last month in Utah. Governor Spencer Cox, a Republican, urged all school districts and the Board of Education to remove cellphones from classrooms. He explained that studies had repeatedly shown students do better in school when their phones are not available.</p>
<p>The studies, Cox noted, found that learning improves, distractions are decreased, and students are more likely to talk to each other if their phones are taken away.</p>
<p>"We just need a space for six or seven hours a day where kids are not <strong>tethered</strong> to these devices," Cox told reporters. He said his urging, which does not have the force of law, is part of a larger legislative push to protect children from social media harms.</p>
<p>Patrick Truman is a high school teacher in Maryland who bans student phone use during class. "Cellphone use is out of control," he told the AP. "By that, I mean that I cannot control it, even in my own classroom."</p>
<p>Truman bought a container that can hold 36 phones. But he says that still, every day, students find ways to hide their phones so they can still use them.</p>
<p>Last year, Florida became the first state to strongly restrict phones in schools. A law took effect in July that requires all public schools in the state to ban student cellphone use and block social media services during class. Some school districts went a step further and banned phones for the whole school day.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, Vermont and Kansas also recently introduced what is becoming known as "phone-free schools" legislation.</p>
<p>Two U.S. senators – Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat – introduced federal legislation in December. The legislation would require a government study on how phone use by students affects their mental health and school progress.</p>
<p>The National Center for Education Statistics reports that nationally, 77 percent of U.S. schools say they currently ban phones for non-school use. Education experts, however, say that number is misleading. That is because it does not mean students are actually following the rules or that all the schools are enforcing them.</p>
<p>Many educators and experts say that, for a school phone ban to work, school administrators must be the ones to enforce it.</p>
<p>Some students say such policies take away their <strong>autonomy</strong> and cut off their main method of communication with family and friends. Opposition has also come from parents who fear they could be cut off from their children if there is a school emergency.</p>
<p>Kim Whitman is a leader of the Phone-Free Schools Movement, a group that advises schools. She told the AP she urges educators to make exceptions for students with special educational and medical needs.</p>

            <title>Vietnamese Woman Accused of $12.5 Billion Fraud  (2024/3/6) | 越南前女首富被控欺诈125亿美元</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>A major property investor in Vietnam, Truong My Lan, is on trial over an accusation of fraud amounting to $12.5 billion. That is nearly 3 percent of the country's 2022 total economic production and the largest financial fraud case on record.<br/>
越南主要房地产投资商张美兰因涉嫌欺诈125亿美元而受审。这几乎占该国2022年经济总量的3%，也是有记录以来最大的金融欺诈案件。</p>
<p>Lan is the 66-year-old head of the property company Van Thinh Phat. The company was one of Vietnam's biggest property companies and its projects include homes, offices, hotels, and business centers.<br/>
现年66岁的张美兰是越南万盛发房地产公司的负责人。该公司是越南最大的房地产公司之一，其项目包括住宅、办公室、酒店和商业中心。</p>
<p>A government document says she reportedly used "thousands of ghost companies," paid bribes to government officials, and broke banking laws. She is accused of illegally controlling the Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank from 2012 to 2022 and using it to steal $12.5 billion, the document adds.<br/>
一份政府文件称，据报道她利用了“数千家幽灵公司”，向政府官员行贿，并违反了银行法。文件补充道，她被指控在2012年至2022年非法控制西贡商业股份银行，并利用该银行窃取125亿美元。</p>
<p>Another 85 people are being charged in the case, including a former State Bank of Vietnam official accused of accepting $5.2 million in bribes. Lan was arrested in October 2022 and could be executed if found guilty.<br/>
另有85人在此案中受到指控，其中包括一名前越南国家银行官员，他被控受贿520万美元。张美兰于2022年10月被捕，如果罪名成立，她可能会被处决。</p>
<p>Officials brought Lan to a Ho Chi Minh City courtroom on Tuesday morning. Her husband Eric Chu Nap-kee, who works in property investment in Hong Kong, was also asked to appear in the case, VN Express reported.<br/>
周二上午，官员将张美兰带上胡志明市法庭。据《越南快讯》报道，她的丈夫Eric Chu Nap-kee（在香港从事房地产投资）也被要求出庭。</p>
<p>Lan's arrest is part of an ongoing anti-corruption drive that brought thousands of officials and business leaders under investigation. In January 2023, then-President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and two top officials resigned for "political responsibility" of corruption dealings during the pandemic.<br/>
张美兰的被捕是正在进行的反腐运动的一部分，该运动使数千名官员和商界领袖受到调查。2023年1月，时任总统阮春福和两名高级官员因对疫情期间的腐败交易负有“政治责任”而辞职。</p>
<p>But observers said the anti-corruption drive has also worsened Vietnam's economic outlook and concerned foreign investors. It came at a time when the Southeast Asian nation has been trying to get businesses to move from China.<br/>
但观察人士表示，反腐运动也恶化了越南的经济前景，并让外国投资者感到担忧。当此之际，这个东南亚国家正试图让企业从中国搬过来。</p>
<p>Linh Nguyen is the lead researcher for Washington D.C.-based Control Risks. She said it is the size of Lan's alleged fraud that has been surprising.<br/>
阮灵是总部位于华盛顿特区的“控制风险组织”的首席研究员。她说，张美兰涉嫌欺诈的规模令人吃惊。</p>
<p>"More than 3 percent of the GDP is very large," Nguyen said. GDP, or gross domestic product, is how much a country produces in one year. She added that it also raised questions about whether other banks and businesses had "done the done the same (and) just haven't been discovered."<br/>
阮灵表示：“超过3%的国内生产总值是非常大的数额。”国内生产总值是一个国家一年的生产量。她补充说，这也引发了人们的疑问，即其他银行和企业是否“也做了同样的事情，只是还没有被发现。”</p>
<p>The anti-corruption drive has also resulted in Vietnam's government slowing down. A report from Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute says that public officials are concerned about being investigated and are avoiding their responsibilities.<br/>
反腐运动也导致越南政府的行动放缓。新加坡尤索夫·伊萨东南亚研究所的一份报告称，公职人员担心被调查，并在逃避责任。</p>
<p>And Nguyen said that investors in banking, finance, and property investment are also taking a "wait and see" position at the moment.<br/>
阮灵表示，银行、金融和房地产投资的投资者目前也持“观望”态度。</p>
<p>Last year, local media reported that 1,300 property companies withdrew from the market and developers have been offering price reductions and gold to bring in buyers.<br/>
当地媒体去年报道称，有1300家房地产公司退出了市场，开发商一直在提供降价和黄金来吸引买家。</p>
<p>But Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's top politician, said in November that the anti-corruption fight would "continue for the long term."<br/>但是，越共总书记、越南最高政治家阮富仲在11月说，越南反腐败斗争将“长期持续”。</p>

<p>My name is Kateryna Bezruk and I teach online in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Someone once said that you should appreciate and enjoy everything that surrounds you.</p>
<p><strong>Poposna before 2022</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Popasna, Ukraine, Town Center in 2018. (Courtesy photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-c787-08dc39e23a01_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Popasna, Ukraine, Town Center in 2018.

<p>Until the spring of 2022, I did not take these words seriously. It seemed that our cozy and developing town Popasna in the Luhansk region would exist forever. The newly refurbished school, called Lyceum 25, would teach our children and grandchildren. The "Unity of Hearts" bridge would always be there for lovers. And there would be walks in the forest and swims in the pond.</p>
<p>But the war came to our town, a small village with a large railway junction between Luhansk and Donetsk. There was a train repair workshop, a locomotive depot, and a bread factory in town. With its fertile black soil, the area was also home to several agricultural businesses.</p>
<p>Why do I use the words ‘was' and ‘were'? Because everything in Popasna is now gone. And the soil is now black with the residue of bombs and artillery shells.</p>
<p><strong>Erased from maps</strong></p>
<p>Russian troops attacked Popasna in February and occupied the town on May 8, 2022. The fighting destroyed much of the town. And Russian officials said they would not rebuild Popasna and simply erased it from maps.</p>
<p>It was not the first time that Popasna had been occupied. The town suffered under Soviet rule in 1932-1933. That was the time the former Soviet Union government's policy led to the deaths of 416 people in Popasna.</p>
<p><strong>Damage of another war</strong></p>
<p>During World War II, the Nazis operated a prison during their occupation of Popasna. The town was heavily damaged but was rebuilt after the war. Returning businesses included a bakery, food plant, sewing factory and a dairy. The 1955 rebuilding also brought rail and transport services, a glass factory, nine schools, five libraries and a stadium. By 1974, Popasna's population was more than 30,000.</p>
<p>Having such experience with rebuilding, I believe that our town will rise again, and "nothing shall burn the living record of our memory."</p>
<p>I'm Jill Robbins.</p>

<p>Business leader Elon Musk is bringing a legal case against artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI and its chief Sam Altman.</p>
<p>Musk is chief of carmaker Tesla and SpaceX and also leads the social media service X. He said OpenAI is <strong>betraying</strong> its founder's aims by seeking to increase profits rather than helping the world.</p>
<p>Musk brought the legal action in San Francisco Superior Court. He said that, at first, he financially supported OpenAI, the maker of the AI tool ChatGPT. He said he had an agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, the president. That agreement was to keep the artificial intelligence company as a nonprofit organization. Musk said the goal was to develop technology that would help the public.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Elon Musk addresses the European Jewish Association's conference, in Krakow, Poland, Monday, Jan. 22, 2024.

<p>Under its founding agreement, OpenAI would also make its <strong>code</strong> open to the public instead of making it the company's private property, the <strong>lawsuit</strong> says. Musk claims in the lawsuit that OpenAI went against the agreement by having a close relationship with Microsoft.</p>
<p>OpenAI did not comment on the lawsuit last week.</p>
<p>Musk's lawsuit says OpenAI broke a contract, failed in its financial responsibility, and used unfair business methods. Musk also wants to prevent anyone, including Microsoft, from profiting from OpenAI's technology.</p>
<p><strong>Musk was early supporter of OpenAI</strong></p>
<p>Anupam Chander is a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He said Musk's claims are unlikely to succeed in court. However, he said that might not be the point for Musk, who is getting his personal story on the record.</p>
<p>Chander said Musk claims he named OpenAI, employed an important scientist, and that he was the main financial supporter in its early years. He said, "In some sense, it's a lawsuit that tries to establish his own place in the history of <strong>generative</strong> AI."</p>
<p>Musk was an early investor in OpenAI when it was founded in 2015. He was a leader in the company alongside Altman. In the lawsuit, he said he invested "tens of millions" of dollars in the nonprofit research laboratory.</p>
<p>Musk left the company in early 2018 in a move that OpenAI said at the time would prevent conflicts of interest. Musk's Tesla car company was looking for people in AI to help develop self-driving car technology.</p>
<p>Musk has since said he disagreed with the company's direction but continued to give money to the nonprofit.</p>
<p>Later, OpenAI created a for-profit arm and began moving most of its workforce to that business. But it kept its nonprofit board of directors that oversaw the company.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft investment</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft made its first $1 billion investment in the company in 2019. The next year Microsoft signed an agreement with OpenAI giving Microsoft the rights to OpenAI's AI models. That agreement is supposed to end once OpenAI has created artificial general intelligence (AGI), the company has said.</p>
<p>AGI is a sort of artificial intelligence that can perform just as well or even better than humans in different kinds of work.</p>
<p>The nonprofit board of directors fired Altman as chief executive officer late last year. But Microsoft helped bring Altman back and pushed most of the old board of directors to leave.</p>
<p>Musk's lawsuit claims that those changes caused the balance of power protecting the nonprofit aim of the company to "collapse overnight." One of Musk's claims is that the directors of the nonprofit have failed in their duty to support its nonprofit aim.</p>
<p>Dana Brakman Reiser is a professor at Brooklyn Law School. She questions whether Musk has standing, or a connection to the case, that a court would uphold.</p>
<p>She said it would be a problem if every person who cared about or gave money to a nonprofit group could bring a lawsuit against its leaders and officers. She said only other directors, or a government legal official could bring that sort of lawsuit.</p>
<p>Musk now has his own AI company. But his legal case against Altman could inform the public about private talks and decision-making that took place at OpenAI. The company's lawyers will likely fight to keep some of those documents from being released.</p>
<p>Investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on X, Musk's social media service: "The discovery will be <strong>epic</strong>." Discovery is the process by which lawyers request documents related to a legal case. Musk answered in his only public comments on the case so far: "Yes."</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation, or DBS, is an experimental treatment that involves having an electrical device placed in the brain.</p>
<p>The treatment gives patients' brains targeted electrical <strong>impulses</strong>.</p>
<p>Researchers say DBS could help some of the nearly 3 million Americans with depression that resists other treatments. It is approved for conditions like Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Many doctors and patients hope it will become more widely available for depression.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Emily Hollenbeck stands for a portrait at the American Museum of Natural History's Rose Center in New York on Jan. 12, 2024.

<p>Recent research suggests gains are possible and more research is planned. However, two earlier studies showed no gains using DBS for depression. Those results have slowed the treatment that involves a brain operation. Some scientists continue to raise concerns about DBS.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has agreed to speed up its study of Abbott Laboratories' request to use its DBS devices for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p><strong>"Nothing else was working"</strong></p>
<p>Emily Hollenbeck lived with severe depression. She compared it to a black hole. She felt as though her arms and legs could barely move. She knew both of her parents had taken their lives and that her condition was dangerous.</p>
<p>Hollenbeck, who grew up poor and sometimes homeless, suffered from signs of depression as a child. In college, after her father's suicide in 2009, she had her first period of major depression. Another happened while she was working. She was concerned she would lose her teaching job and become poor again. She went to the hospital.</p>
<p>"I ended up having sort of an on-and-off <strong>pattern</strong>," she said. Medication helped her for a while.</p>
<p>She was able to earn a doctoral degree in <strong>psychology</strong> although she lost her mom in her final year of graduate school. But the depression stayed with her. At times, she said, she thought about ending her life.</p>
<p>She was willing to try something extreme.</p>
<p>Her doctor then told her about DBS three years ago.</p>
<p>"Nothing else was working," she said.</p>
<p>She became one of a few hundred people to have her depression treated with DBS.</p>
<p>Hollenbeck is part of ongoing research at Mount Sinai West medical center in New York City. Her brain operation took place while she was <strong>sedated</strong> but still awake. Dr. Brian Kopell directs Mount Sinai's Center for Neuromodulation. He placed thin metal <strong>electrodes</strong> in the part of her brain believed to control emotional behavior and is thought to be involved in feelings of sadness.</p>
<p>The thin metal electrodes are connected by wires to a device placed under the skin of her <strong>chest</strong>. The device controls the electrical impulses sending current to her brain.</p>
<p>Doctors involved in DBS say the impulses help because the brain uses electricity to send signals.</p>
<p>In normal brains, Kopell said, electrical activity spreads through the brain unblocked to all areas. In depression, he said, the brain's emotional signals get blocked. He compared the problem to dancing. He said DBS seems to "unstick the circuit," permitting the brain to do what it normally would. A circuit is the path unblocked electrical current takes.</p>
<p>Hollenbeck said the effect on her was almost immediate.</p>
<p>"The first day after surgery, she started feeling a lifting of that <strong>negative</strong> mood, of the heaviness," said her <strong>psychiatrist</strong>, Dr. Martijn Figee.</p>
<p>For Hollenbeck, the biggest change was finding pleasure in music again.</p>
<p>She wishes her treatment had been available for her parents.</p>
<p><strong>The treatment's history</strong></p>
<p>DBS research has continued for at least 20 years. Brain expert Dr. Helen Mayberg led early research that was called promising. But large studies launched more than 12 years ago saw no difference in treated and untreated groups.</p>
<p>Dr. Katherine Scangos is a <strong>psychiatrist</strong> at the University of California, San Francisco. She is also researching DBS and depression. She said there could be two reasons for the major studies showing no effect.</p>
<p>She said one reason was that the treatment was not "personalized" for each individual in the two studies. The second was that researchers looked at outcomes over just a few weeks.</p>
<p>Recent research has shown more promising results for depression. A 2022 study said that on average 60 percent of depression patients showed improvement with DBS. A study from 2023 said that after six months of targeted DBS treatment, 90 percent of subjects showed improvements. Seventy percent were no longer considered medically depressed.</p>
<p>Treatments being tested by teams today target individual patients more closely. The team at Mount Sinai, for example, is using brain imaging to find the right place to put electrodes in the brain.</p>
<p>Mayberg is also with Mount Sinai. She said, "Everybody's brain is a little different, just like people's eyes are a little further apart or a nose is a little bigger or smaller."</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>
<p>Medical devices manufacturer Abbott Laboratories is launching a large <strong>clinical trial </strong>on patients this year, ahead of a possible decision by the FDA.</p>
<p>Scangos said: "I'm hoping we will have approval within a short time."</p>
<p>But some doctors have concerns. They point to possible dangers of having a brain operation, which include bleeding, stroke and infection.</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley Caroff is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. He said scientists do not know the exact pathways or systems in the brain that produce depression. That makes it difficult to send the impulses to the right place.</p>
<p>"I believe from a psychiatric point of view, the science is not there," he said of DBS for depression.</p>
<p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>
<p>Hollenbeck said DBS has not cured her. She still takes medicines for depression and needs ongoing care.</p>
<p>She recently visited Mayberg of Mount Sinai in her office and discussed recovery. "It's not about being happy all the time," Mayberg told her. "It's about making progress."</p>
<p>Researchers are studying the progress patients make. Recent research by Mayberg and others published in <em>Nature</em> said scientists can study brain activity to see how someone is doing at any given time.</p>
<p>Study subjects can provide data from their homes about how they feel. Subjects answer questions and send data from their devices to researchers. They also send videos where researchers can observe speech and facial movements.</p>
<p>Additionally, patients go to Mount Sinai so researchers can collect more information about their body movements. Hollenbeck, for example, is showing faster movements as her condition improves.</p>
<p>The data gained, combined with other information like life events, records how she is doing. This helps guide doctors' decisions about treatment, like increasing the amount of electricity used — which they did once.</p>
<p>Hollenbeck showed AP the scars on her chest and head where doctors had placed the DBS devices. To her, they were signs of how far she had come.</p>
<p>She added, "...I'm able to see and remember, even on a bodily level, that I'm going to be OK."</p>

            <title>Locals Worried about Olympic Surfing Event in Tahiti  (2024/3/5)</title>

<p>The Summer Olympic Games this year are in Paris, France.</p>
<p>Paris does not have an ocean. So, how do organizers plan to present competition in the sport of surfing?</p>
<p>They are taking that Olympic event halfway around the world to the South Pacific country of French Polynesia. The athletes will compete on the island of Tahiti, in a small coastal village called Teahupo'o. The area is rural. It did not even have a road until the 1970s.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Tahitian-born surfer Kauli Vaast rides a wave in Teahupo'o, Tahiti, French Polynesia, Sunday, Jan. 13, 2024.

" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/e6989c0a-6001-447b-8bb5-ce80206c7faa_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Tahitian-born surfer Kauli Vaast rides a wave in Teahupo'o, Tahiti, French Polynesia, Sunday, Jan. 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole)
</span></div>
<p>Hundreds of people are expected to visit Teahupo'o to watch the sport, as the surfers go out onto the famous waves from July 27 to August 4.</p>
<p>Peva Levy is a Tahitian surfer. He said the Teahupo'o beach was a "secret spot" when he first rode the waves there more than fifty years ago. But, he added, it did not stay secret. Teahupo'o gained fame among surfers around the world in the years since.</p>
<p>Levy said the place has a special energy, a feeling known as "mana" in the local language.</p>
<p>And the people who live there want that special quality protected. There are concerns that a week of Olympic competition in Teahupo'o could destroy the "mana" and harm the environment that surrounds it.</p>
<p>Proposed preparations for the event included building temporary housing, roads, and even a large structure out on the water. The work called for drilling into a <strong>coral reef</strong>. Opposition to the plans quickly grew.</p>
<p>Environmentalists, locals and surfers joined forces to protect Teahupo'o's culture, its corals and other sea life.</p>
<p>"It was too much for us, a big change," said Levy, who also serves on a local environmental organization Vai Ara o Teahupo'o.</p>
<p>The group told the Olympic organizers they did not want new buildings or roads. And organizers are adjusting their plans as a result.</p>
<p>For example, they will not be building any Olympic housing. Instead, athletes will stay on a nearby boat. Homes of locals will serve other Olympic housing needs.</p>
<p>Organizers also shrunk the size of the planned structure, a platform, they will build in the ocean. Judges will watch the competition from the platform.</p>
<p>Some people worry that the <strong>drilling</strong> into the reef will disrupt the ecosystem and attract a dangerous <strong>algae</strong>. If fish eat the algae, people who eat the fish can become sick.</p>
<p>Twenty-two-year-old Mormon Maitei is concerned about the fish in the area. Maitei is a spearfisher who catches fish to feed his family. He sells what they do not need. The water is "where we get our dinner," he said.</p>
<p>Tahitians also worry that changing the reef could also change the shape of the famous waves.</p>
<p>Levy said if the reef cracks and breaks off "there will be no more wave over here, it will be finished for us."</p>
<p>In December, the worries of the locals were confirmed when a boat working on some Olympic construction hit a piece of the reef and broke it.</p>
<p>Cindy Otcenasek, the president of Via Ara o Teahupo'o, called the destruction deeply hurtful.</p>
<p>She said in Polynesian culture, people believe gods and spirits are everywhere, "in the coral, in the ocean. The ocean is considered to be our most sacred temple," she said.</p>
<p>Otcenasek said the fish live in and around the corals, "so if we break a coral, we break a home."</p>
<p>Barbara Martins-Nio is a senior event manager for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games Organization Committee. She called the accident "<strong>awful</strong>." She said Tahitians have a "special relationship with nature ... and it was like a bomb for us."</p>
<p>Since the incident, Martins-Nio said, the relationship between the organizers and locals has improved. The Olympic group is moving slowly and asking for more input from the local groups.</p>

            <title>US Supreme Court Rules Trump Can Stay on Ballots  (2024/3/5) | 美国最高法院裁定川普可参加大选</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The United States Supreme Court ruled on Monday that former President Donald Trump can stay on 2024 presidential primary ballots.<br/>
美国最高法院周一裁定，前总统川普可以继续参加2024年的总统初选。</p>
<p>All nine justices ruled that individual states cannot use the 14th Amendment to prevent presidential candidates from appearing on ballots. They said that power "rests with Congress and not the states."<br/>
所有九名大法官都裁定，个别州不能利用第十四修正案阻止总统候选人出现在选票上。他们说，这项权力“归于国会而非各州”。</p>
<p>The ruling ended efforts in several states, including Colorado, Maine and Illinois, to remove Trump from ballots for presidential primary elections run by state governments.<br/>
这项裁决终止了几个州将川普从州政府举行的总统初选选票中除名的努力，这些州包括科罗拉多州、缅因州和伊利诺伊州。</p>
<p>Those state governments wanted to remove Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican Party nomination, from ballots because of his activities related to the 2020 presidential election. Trump is accused of trying to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He is also accused of involvement in activities that led to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.<br/>
这些州政府希望将共和党提名的主要候选人川普从选票中除名，原因是他在2020年总统大选中的相关举动。川普被指控试图推翻他输给民主党人拜登的事实。他还被指控参与了导致1月6日美国国会大厦骚乱的活动。</p>
<p>Colorado's highest state court decided that Trump incited the January 6 attack. It also ruled that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was passed shortly after the American Civil War, could be applied to Trump. The amendment aimed to prevent former officeholders of the U.S. who "have engaged in insurrection" or "given aid or comfort" to such activity from holding such office again.<br/>
科罗拉多州最高法院裁定川普煽动了1月6日的袭击。它还裁定，美国内战后不久通过的第14修正案第3条可以适用于川普。该修正案旨在防止“参与叛乱”或“为此类活动提供帮助或配合”的前美国官员再次担任此类职务。</p>
<p>In Monday's ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court did not deal with the issue of insurrection. All nine justices agreed that Trump should be on the ballot. But they offered different opinions on the ruling.<br/>
在周一的裁决中，美国最高法院没有处置暴动问题。所有九位大法官都同意川普应该被名列选票上。但他们对裁决提出了不同意见。</p>
<p>A five-justice conservative majority wrote, "The Constitution makes Congress, rather than the states, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates."<br/>
五名占多数优势的保守派法官写道：“宪法规定由国会，而不是由各州负责对联邦官员和候选人执行第3条。”</p>
<p>Three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, jointly wrote, "Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President."<br/>
三位自由派大法官索尼娅·索托马约尔、埃琳娜·卡根和凯坦吉·布朗·杰克逊共同写道：“今天，多数派超越了本案的必要性，限制了第3条如何禁止一名宣誓叛乱者成为总统。”</p>
<p>And Justice Amy Coney Barrett added that the majority should not have dealt with the "question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced."<br/>
大法官艾米·科尼·巴雷特补充道，多数派不应该处理“联邦立法是否是执行第3条的唯一途径的问题”。</p>
<p>Trump posted on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: "BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!"<br/>
裁决发布后不久，川普在其社交媒体网络上发帖称：“美国的重大胜利！！！”</p>
<p>The case is the Supreme Court's latest direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore. In that case, the court stopped the recount of votes in the state of Florida that effectively handed the 2000 election to Republican George W. Bush.<br/>
这是自小布什诉戈尔案以来，最高法院最新一次直接卷入总统选举。在那起案件中，最高法院阻止了佛罗里达州重新计票，这实际上将2000年的选举胜利交给了共和党人小布什。</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has an even more important case ahead that involves Trump directly on the week of April 22.<br/>
最高法院还有一起更重要的案件，将于4月22日这一周直接涉及川普。</p>
<p>A three-judge federal appeals court had ruled earlier that Trump could be put on trial for trying to undo the 2020 elections and actions leading to the January 6 attack. But the nation's highest court agreed last week to hear whether Trump could face criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office as president.<br/>
一家由三名法官组成的联邦上诉法院早些时候裁定，川普可能因试图撤销2020年的选举和导致1月6日国会袭击的行为而受审。但美国最高法院上周同意审理川普是否会因担任总统期间的行为而面临刑事起诉。</p>
<p>The decision effectively put on hold several federal cases against Trump and raised questions about whether Trump will be tried before the November election.<br/>
这一决定实际上搁置了几起针对川普的联邦案件，并引发了人们对川普是否会在11月大选前受审的质疑。</p>
<p>Recently, a jury in New York City found Trump guilty of defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. It ordered him to pay her $83 million. Last month, a New York judge presiding over Trump's civil fraud trial set a penalty and interest of $450 million and barred Trump from running a business in the state for three years. Later in March, Trump will face a trial for charges related to payments made to adult movie performer Stormy Daniels.<br/>
最近，纽约市的一个陪审团裁定川普诽谤作家简·卡罗尔罪名成立。陪审团命令川普赔付给她8300万美元。上个月，主持川普民事欺诈案审判的纽约法官设定了4.5亿美元的罚款和利息，并禁止川普在三年内在该州经营企业。3月晚些时候，川普将因向成人电影演员斯托米·丹尼尔斯付款而面临审判。</p>
<p>In addition to those ongoing cases, the former president is facing charges brought by the state of Georgia over his actions related to the 2020 presidential election. And the federal government has brought a case against Trump in the state of Florida for holding classified documents after leaving office.<br/>
除了这些正在进行的案件外，这位前总统还因其与2020年总统选举有关的行为而面临佐治亚州的指控。同时联邦政府已在佛罗里达州对川普提起诉讼，指控他在离任后持有机密文件。</p>

<p>A new study suggests that an <strong>asteroid</strong> strike by an American spacecraft likely changed the shape of the targeted object.</p>
<p>NASA crashed the DART spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos in 2022. The asteroid strike happened about 11 million kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p>The experiment tested a method for changing the orbit of some asteroids to prevent them from possibly crashing into our planet in the future.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This artist's illustration depicts NASA's DART spacecraft, which will be launched to crash into an asteroid to see how the crash affects the space object's path.

(Image Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL)</span></div>
<p>NASA has said its studies of the crash showed it was successful because the force of the strike changed the asteroid's orbit around a larger asteroid Didymos. NASA's measurements also found the strike reduced the orbital period of Dimorphos by 33 minutes.</p>
<p>Such a major crash would normally create a large <strong>crater</strong> in the targeted object. But a new study presents evidence that the crash made more than a hole – it likely changed the shape of the whole asteroid.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>Astronomers at the University of Bern, in Switzerland carried out the research. A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02200-3">study</a> detailing the findings recently appeared in the publication <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>
<p>The team used a computer<strong> simulation</strong> system to study the changes to Dimorphos that resulted from the crash. The system aimed to recreate the breakup of space objects that have been hit.</p>
<p>The researchers said their simulation method has been used in the past to recreate space objects crashing into each other. For example, the team said it confirmed the results of a Japanese spacecraft collecting a sample from the Ryugu asteroid in 2019.</p>
<p>Sabina Raducan is with the Physics Institute of the University of Bern. She helped lead the project. Raducan <a class="wsw__a" href="https://mediarelations.unibe.ch/media_releases/2024/media_releases_2024/impact_of_the_dart_space_probe_could_have_deformed_an_asteroid/index_eng.html">described</a> the simulation process in a statement as "computationally intensive." In total, she said 250 simulations were completed, which reproduced the first two hours after the asteroid strike.</p>
<p>The researchers used all available information about NASA's operation. These included the predicted shape of Dimorphos, data on the strike itself, as well as the size of the cloud the crash left behind. In addition, the team aimed to estimate unknown details about the asteroid and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>"Then what we did is <strong>check</strong> which of the simulation run outcomes most closely match observed reality," Raducan said.</p>
<p>She added that results of the research provided clear evidence that the crash turned Dimorphos into a relatively weak "<strong>rubble pile</strong>" asteroid. Raducan explained this meant that the object is currently being held together "by the asteroid's extremely weak gravity" rather than a solid and strong mass.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that the results of the simulation and the team's examinations partly explain why the crash was so effective in changing the path of the asteroid.</p>
<p>Raducan said the results also persuaded the team that "the likelihood is that the crater grew to <strong>encompass</strong> the entire body itself, so that Dimorphos ended up being completely reshaped." It is therefore unlikely that a crater still exists after the crash.</p>
<p>The researchers said the existence of a crater can be investigated further by a European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft. The spacecraft, called Hera, is preparing for a possible launch in October.</p>
<p>ESA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera">says</a> Hera's cameras and instruments will carry out detailed studies of Dimorphos and the asteroid it orbits, Didymos. During the operation, the spacecraft will aim to collect the most data yet on such an asteroid system.</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>

<p>Vladimir Kara-Murza is a <strong>critic</strong> of the Russian government.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year on charges of treason for speaking against Russia's war with Ukraine.</p>
<p>He is in Penal Colony Number 6, south of Moscow and not far from Kazakhstan.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A replica of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's jail cell from last year that was installed on a square near the Louvre Museum in Paris is pictured on March 14, 2023.

(AP Photo/Thomas Padilla, File)</span></div>
<p>Kara-Murza's wife, Yevgenia, spoke with <em>The Associated Press</em> about her husband's experiences.</p>
<p>She said her husband lives in a small cell with a <strong>cot</strong>, a sink, a stool and toilet. The only things he owns are a drinking cup and a toothbrush.</p>
<p>People are interested in what life is like inside of the prisons because another critic of President Vladimir Putin's government died at a prison in Russia's far north, close to the Arctic Circle. Alexei Navalny died February 16. He was the leader of a political group that campaigned against Putin. Forty-seven-year-old Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison in early 2021.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press </em>called life in Russia's prisons "<strong>grim</strong>" and noted the prisoners suffer from a lack of food, sleep, and healthcare. They also must deal with rules that change all the time.</p>
<p>Grigory Vaypan is a lawyer with Memorial, a group that started during the period of the Soviet Union. Memorial received the Nobel Prize in 2022. The group studies the experiences of political prisoners, and how Russia uses the threat of prison to quiet critics.</p>
<p>Vaypan said there are 680 political prisoners in Russia. He also said no one in the Russian prison system is safe, but the situation is worse for government critics.</p>
<p>"The state aims to additionally punish them, or additionally <strong>isolate</strong> them from the world, or do everything to break their spirit," Vaypan said.</p>
<p>Kara-Murza's sentence of 25 years is the longest in modern Russia. He is one of a growing number of critics held in prison for expressing their anti-Putin opinions.</p>
<p>Historians say the Russian prison system developed from the Soviet Union's "gulags." The prisons of that time were known for their bad conditions. Nobel Prize-winning writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn documented the prisons in his books <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich </em>and <em>The Gulag Archipelago</em>.</p>
<p>Yevgenia Kara-Murza, the wife of Vladimir Kara-Murza, described Russian prison life:</p>
<p><strong>Meals</strong></p>
<p>Meals are simple and not very satisfying. The first meal of the day is porridge, a liquid made from grains. The midday meal is soup with very little meat, along with mashed potatoes and a piece of meat or fish. For dinner, the meal is almost the same. Prisoners are permitted to eat two eggs per week. They can buy fruits and vegetables at small prison stores but not much is available.</p>
<p>Friends and family can send packages with other foods. But those in <strong>solitary cells</strong> are not permitted to receive packages.</p>
<p><strong>How do people spend their time?</strong></p>
<p>Some prisoners are told to spend most of their days doing tasks such as cleaning their rooms. Other times they are told to only "stand at attention." They sometimes must listen to recordings of prison rules for hours.</p>
<p>Others are told to work. There are not enough jobs for all the men in the prison. In women's prisons, the jobs often include <strong>sewing</strong> uniforms for the military, police and other workers. There are 30 to 40 women's prisons in Russia.</p>
<p>One woman, Nadya Tolokonnikova, was in prison for nearly 22 months. She was a member of the rock band Pussy Riot. Her prison time was from 2012 to 2013. She said she worked on uniforms for 16 to 18 hours at a time.</p>
<p>"It's a system of slavery and it is truly horrible," she said.</p>
<p>Inmates — another word for prisoners — are supposed to be paid at least minimum wage. That is about $200 per month. But experts say it is usually much less. Sasha Graf is an activist for better prison conditions. Graf said prisoners' pay can be as low as $3.20 per month. That is only enough to buy cigarettes at the prison store.</p>
<p><strong>Intimidation</strong></p>
<p>Tolokonnikova said, when she arrived at Penal Colony No. 14 in Mordovia, the head of the prison described himself as a "Stalinist."</p>
<p>She said he told her: "You may be a somebody outside of this colony, have a voice, people who support you and care for you, but here, you are completely in my power, and you need to understand this."</p>
<p>Zoya Svetova, a reporter and prisoner rights activist, said that in the past, prisons were overseen by commissions that were supposed to make sure the prisoners were treated with respect. However, she said, most of the people have been replaced with those loyal to Putin's government. The government uses the prisons, she said, for "<strong>intimidation</strong> and oppression."</p>
<p>Oleg Kozlovsky, of Amnesty International, said political prisoners can be safe from the abuse that regular prisoners suffer. But there are still ways to make political prisoners feel bad.</p>
<p>Navalny, he said, spent months in a cell on his own for breaking small rules such as not having his uniform buttoned the right way or not putting his hands behind his back at the right time.</p>
<p>The time in the small cell – where it could be very cold in winter or very hot in summer – was not good for Navalny's health. He had been poisoned in the past and was still suffering from the effects of the poison.</p>
<p>Kara-Murza's wife said her husband had also been poisoned. Although he is only 42, his health has worsened. She said he needs exercise and physical therapy to help his arms and legs.</p>
<p>Alexei Gorinov is 62. He criticized the war and was sent to prison for seven years.</p>
<p>He has breathing problems and had a medical operation to remove one of his lungs. He is now in a prison hospital, but his lawyer says he is mistreated. Guards wake him up every two hours. He considers it a form of torture.</p>
<p>There have been calls for prison reform in recent years. Vaypan of the Memorial group, said whatever led to Navalny's death shows the prison system has crossed a line.</p>
<p>It's a "worrying signal," he said.</p>

            <title>Costs, Performance Influence Decisions on Electric School Buses  (2024/3/4)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">03 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The first electric school buses in the United States began operating about 10 years ago in California. Fewer than one percent of the 489,000 school buses in the U.S. were electric at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>However, the number of electric school buses currently operating or that have been ordered from a manufacturer has more than tripled in the last two years. That information comes from the Electric School Bus Initiative of the non-profit World Resources Institute, or WRI, based in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The WRI said that increase means 10 times as many students now ride electric school buses — from around 20,000 in 2020 to 200,000 three years later. The number of states with electric bus laws or goals also grew from two to 14 between 2020 and last year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rock Creek Forest Elementary School students exit a diesel bus before attending school, Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, in Chevy Chase, Md.

At right is an electric school bus. (AP Photo/Tom Brenner)</span></div>
<p>People and organizations that want electric school buses can find it difficult to get local officials to find ways to pay for them.</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of breaking down these barriers," said Alicia Cox. She is a mother of two in Jackson, Wyoming. Her state is the only one that does not have a single <strong>school district</strong> with an electric bus operating or on order.</p>
<p>Cox's son, a second grader, often rides a diesel bus to school.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with electric buses </strong></p>
<p>Parents and local officials say one of the biggest problems with electric school buses is their cost. Even with the fuel and <strong>maintenance</strong> savings of an electric bus, they cost two to three times more than diesel fueled buses.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency says it has a $5 billion program for <strong>zero-emissions</strong> buses. The money comes from an infrastructure law passed by the U.S. Congress under the administration of President Joe Biden in 2021. Nearly 440 <strong>grants</strong> and <strong>rebates </strong>totaling about $1.8 billion have already been released. The goal of the federal money is to replace thousands of buses across several hundred school districts in the U.S.</p>
<p>Demand for the money has been "heartening," said Christine Koester. She is a director for the Clean School Bus Program at the EPA.</p>
<p>In addition to federal money, supporters have successfully pushed to use other money. That includes money from federal government legal cases, like the Volkswagen emissions settlement. In that case, the U.S. government brought legal action against the German carmaker for having a system that gave false car emissions results.</p>
<p>For school districts that are not receiving federal money, there are other possibilities. These include <strong>leasing </strong>buses from companies that supply the buses and the equipment needed. This method spreads costs out over time.</p>
<p><strong>Choices </strong></p>
<p>Dearborn Public Schools is a Detroit area school district in the Midwestern state of Michigan. Seventy percent of families in the district are poor. Communications director David Mustonen said the district was interested in new technology when it began operating its first electric bus in December 2022.</p>
<p>The district bought an electric school bus with a $300,000 federal grant. The bus has been operational only about three of the 12 months since then. That is because of maintenance needs and learning about the device. That is not <strong>discouraging </strong>Dearborn from moving forward with adding 18 additional electric school buses. But those problems represent a risk other school districts may not want to take.</p>
<p>There are other problems slowing the change to electric buses. School districts sometimes take a long time to approve electric buses. Manufacturing of the buses can be delayed, and electric buses require special electrical connections for charging. And, of course, electricity costs money, too.</p>
<p>Wyoming refused federal money from the EPA because of concerns about how far the buses could travel. There were also concerns about cold temperatures. Wyoming is a very large Western state where travel distances are big and, in the winter, temperatures can get very cold. Electric battery performance decreases in cold temperatures.</p>
<p>"Even though diesel is not as clean, it's getting the job done," Cox said schools and<strong> fleet </strong>managers tell her.</p>

<p>My name is Kateryna Denysenko; I work at the Gymnasium of Veselianka.</p>
<p>War is always a tragedy.</p>
<p>It ruined lives, separated families, and destroyed cities.</p>
<p>Like many life-changing events, war could also be viewed as a way to teach us important things. Thucydides, an ancient Athenian historian and general, once wrote, "War is a stern teacher." And today, we are going to share three important lessons the war in Ukraine has taught us.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer work and donations are important.</strong></p>
<p>If there was one important lesson to share, it would have been this: volunteer work and donations are important!</p>
<p>Let's be honest. We often pay little attention when someone asks us to donate money, clothes, food, or blood to someone in need. We may feel that our help would be too small. And we spend even less time on volunteer work, thinking that it takes time and energy and may not be useful.</p>
<p>Ukrainians may argue with that. We understand that even the smallest amount of money can help to buy armor and weapons for our army. And the more people decide to help, the safer our soldiers feel, and the more protected the country becomes.</p>
<p>But you should not forget about people in need. If you donate your clothes, food, or blood to those who were seriously wounded or lost their homes, you will help them survive. Your small act of kindness will also help them save some of their resources to move on.</p>
<p>Volunteer work also matters a lot for Ukrainians. You can help by removing parts of fallen buildings or by cooking free meals for soldiers. Your participation will greatly help others!</p>
<p><strong>If you want to do something, do it.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we do not say good things to others. We may be too shy to give a compliment. Or we do not know if the person will like what we say. Maybe, our words will be out of place.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we do not get around to visiting certain places. Who needs to spend their time going to a historical place, a park, or an old café? These places have existed for so long. They would not disappear, would they?</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, Ukrainians have known the harsh reality.</p>
<p>We know that you may never see someone again. They may flee to another city for safety, their house may collapse, or they can go to war and never come back. And the place you always wanted to visit may be destroyed by a missile.</p>
<p>We rarely tell our family members and friends how happy we are to have them in our lives. You may never have another chance to tell them how much you love and value them. But if you tell them something kind, your words will support and encourage them in such uncertain times.</p>
<p>That is why we remember the rule: if you want to say something good or go somewhere nice, do it now. Do not wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>There is always a reason to be grateful.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we take many things in our lives for granted. We expect to sleep well at night, eat healthy meals, have a place to live, and go to school or work. We get used to them so much that they become routine and even boring.</p>
<p>Before we know it, we are looking for something new and fresh and something unusual. But people in Ukraine know the value of routine and boring things in their daily lives.</p>
<p>When the noise from missiles keeps us awake, we begin to appreciate a good sleep. When we have to study remotely, or we lose our workplace due to the war, we appreciate the time with our classmates, teachers, or colleagues.</p>
<p>As we spend our days and nights in a bomb shelter or move far away from our homes, we begin to appreciate the place we live and the meals we cook and eat.</p>
<p>This may be one of the most important lessons from the war so far. We should appreciate these small, but very important things in our lives.</p>
<p>In his 28th song, Ukrainian songwriter Hryhorii Skovoroda wrote, "What you need is easy to get, what you do not need is hard to get." And now, after going through the war, and losing so many different things, we can agree that the simplest ones are the most important in our lives.</p>
<p>These were the three most important lessons from the war in Ukraine. We hope they will inspire you to value the simplest things in your life, to visit the places you always wanted to visit, to do small acts of kindness for people in need, and to show your love and gratitude to your closest people!</p>

            <title>How Did Human Ancestors Lose Their Tails?  (2024/3/3)</title>

<p>Our very ancient animal ancestors had <strong>tails</strong>. Why don't we have them now?</p>
<p>From the time of Charles Darwin, a scientist from the 1800s who studied evolutionary biology, scientists have questioned why and how this happened.</p>
<p>The answer is somewhere around 20 million or 25 million years ago. That was the time apes, the group of animals humans are part of, split from another animal group, m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s. During that split, our branch of the tree of life lost its tail.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Skeletons of a human and a m&lt;I&gt;&lt;I&gt;onkey&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/I&gt; await installation at the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv, Israel on Monday, Feb 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7770b6c8-b28b-45e7-9e8e-f8dd2c39c025_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Skeletons of a human and a m<i><i>onkey</i></i> await installation at the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv, Israel on Monday, Feb 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty, File)</span></div>
<p>Now, scientists have identified at least one of the genetic differences that led to this change.</p>
<p>"We found a single <strong>mutation</strong> in a very important gene," said Bo Xia. He is a geneticist at the Broad Institute and helped write the study recently released in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the genomes of six kinds of apes, including humans, and 15 kinds of m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s with tails to find important differences between the groups. Once they identified an important mutation, they tested their theory by using the gene-<strong>editing</strong> tool CRISPR. They used it to change the same place in <strong>embryos </strong>of an animal often used in laboratories, mice. Those mice were born without tails.</p>
<p>Xia said, however, that other genetic changes may also play a part in losing tails.</p>
<p>Another mystery: Did having no tails help these ape ancestors – and eventually, humans – survive? Or was it just a chance mutation in a population that survived for other reasons?</p>
<p>"It could be <strong>random</strong> chance, but it could have brought a big evolutionary <strong>advantage</strong>," said Miriam Konkel. She is an evolutionary geneticist at Clemson University, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>As to why having no tails may have helped our ancestors, there are many interesting theories. They include some that link being tailless to learning to walk upright.</p>
<p>Rick Potts directs the Human Origins Project of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He was not involved in the research. Potts suggests being tailless may have been a first step toward some apes standing upright, even before they left the trees.</p>
<p>Not all apes live on the ground today. Orangutans and gibbons are tailless apes that still live in trees. But Potts notes that they move very differently than m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s, who move along the tops of branches, using their tails for balance. Those apes hang below branches, holding onto the branches with their arms while hanging largely upright.</p>
<p>New York University biologist Itai Yanai helped write the study. He said that losing our tails was clearly a large change. But the only way to truly know the reason "would be to invent a time machine," he said.</p>

美国卫生官员敦促老年人再接种一针更新版新冠疫苗。</p>
<p>The advice for Americans 65 and older was recently issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/>
美国疾控预防中心最近发布了针对65岁及以上美国人的建议。</p>
<p>A statement by CDC Director Mandy Cohen explained the new guidance. "Most COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations last year were among people 65 years and older. An additional vaccine dose can provide added protection ... for those at highest risk."<br/>
美国疾控预防中心主任曼迪·科恩在一份声明中对这份新的指导意见做出了解释。“去年新冠肺炎死亡和住院患者多数都是65岁及以上人群。对这些高危人群来说，接种一剂加强针可以提供更多防护。</p>
<p>The CDC said an additional dose of the vaccine can provide increased protection, even if older adults received the updated shot version launched last autumn.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心表示，即使老年人接种了去年秋天推出的更新疫苗，再接种一剂疫苗也可以提供更多的保护。</p>
<p>The new guidance suggests individuals who did receive the updated shot – which became available last September – should wait at least four months before getting the latest dose.<br/>
新的指导意见建议，接种了去年9月推出的更新疫苗的人群，应该至少等待四个月才能接种最新的疫苗。</p>
<p>The CDC's decision, or recommendation, came after much debate over whether to say older people "may" get the shots or "should" do so. That discussion demonstrates the ongoing debate among experts about how necessary additional COVID-19 shots are.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心的决定或建议，是在对老年人接种这剂疫苗是“可选择”，还是“应该”进行了大量辩论之后做出的。这一讨论表明，专家们正在就额外接种新冠疫苗的必要性进行辩论。</p>
<p>Some doctors have said they think most older adults are effectively protected after getting the shot last autumn. And studies have suggested the shots stay effective for six months.<br/>
一些医生表示，他们认为大多数老年人在去年秋天接种疫苗后得到了有效的保护。研究表明，这些疫苗的有效期为六个月。</p>
<p>But health officials have noted the body's vaccine-activated defenses can decrease over time, especially in older people. The CDC had recommended additional COVID-19 shots, called boosters, for older adults in 2022 and 2023.<br/>
但卫生官员指出，随着时间的推移，疫苗激活的人体防御能力会下降，尤其是在老年人中。美国疾控预防中心在2022年和2023年建议为老年人额外接种新冠疫苗加强针。</p>
<p>COVID-19 can still present serious health risks, especially to older people and those with existing medical conditions. The CDC says there are still more than 20,000 hospitalizations and more than 2,000 deaths each week from COVID-19. Individuals 65 years and older have the highest hospitalization and death rates.<br/>
新冠肺炎仍可能带来严重的健康风险，尤其是对老年人和既有病患。美国疾控预防中心表示，新冠肺炎每周仍然导致2万多人住院，2000多人死亡。65岁及以上人群的住院率和死亡率最高。</p>
<p>Some members of the CDC group that approved the latest advice said the word "should" in the guidance is meant to persuade more doctors and drug stores to offer the shots.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心批准这一最新建议的小组的一些成员表示，指南中的“应该”一词旨在说服更多的医生和药店提供疫苗。</p>
<p>"Most people are coming in either wanting the vaccine or not," Dr. Jamie Loehr told The Associated Press. He is a member of the CDC's deciding committee and a family doctor in Ithaca, New York. "I am trying to make it easier for providers to say, ‘Yes, we recommend this.'"<br/>
詹米·勒尔博士告诉美联社：“大多数人要么想接种疫苗，要么不想接种。”他是美国疾控预防中心决策委员会的成员，也是纽约伊萨卡的一名家庭医生。“我试图让提供疫苗者更容易说出，‘是的，我们建议这样做。’”</p>
<p>In September, the government ordered a new COVID-19 shot based on a version of the virus called XBB.1.5. That single-target vaccine replaced combinations that had targeted both the first COVID-19 version and a much earlier Omicron version.<br/>
去年9月，美国政府下令接种一剂新的新冠疫苗，该疫苗是基于XBB.1.5病毒版本。这种单靶点疫苗取代了针对第一种新冠肺炎版本和更早的奥密克戎版本的组合。</p>
<p>The CDC recommended that vaccine version for everyone 6 months and older. It also urged people with weak immune systems to get a second shot up to two months after the first.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心建议6个月及以上人群接种该疫苗。它还敦促免疫系统较弱人群在接种第一针后两个月内接种第二针。</p>
<p>But most Americans did not listen to that advice. The latest CDC data shows that 13 percent of U.S. children got the shots, while 22 percent of U.S. adults did. The vaccination rate for adults 65 and older is higher, at nearly 42 percent.<br/>
但大多数美国人没有听从这个建议。美国疾控预防中心的最新数据显示，接种了这剂疫苗的美国儿童为13%，而美国成年人为22%。65岁及以上人群的疫苗接种率更高，接近42%。</p>
<p>"People are tired of getting all these shots all the time," Dr. David Canaday told the AP. He is an infectious diseases expert at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.<br/>
大卫·卡纳迪博士告诉美联社：“人们已经厌倦了一直接种这些疫苗。”他是俄亥俄州克利夫兰市凯斯西储大学的传染病专家。</p>
<p>Canaday, who does not serve on the CDC's advisory group, added, "We have to be careful about over-recommending the vaccine."<br/>
卡纳迪不在美国疾控预防中心的咨询小组任职，他补充道，“我们必须对过度推荐疫苗保持谨慎。”</p>

            <title>Professors’ Group Speaks Out about Changes at Florida College  (2024/3/3)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>College professors and their students often say they should be permitted to <strong>pursue</strong> knowledge without too many restrictions from the government.</p>
<p>One organization that supports the idea of <strong>academic</strong> freedom is the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The AAUP is a non-profit group based in Washington D.C. that aims to support academic freedom and <strong>tenure</strong>. The group is concerned that national and state political leaders are interfering too much with colleges and universities.</p>
<p><strong>AAUP expresses concern </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A student makes her way past the sign at New College of Florida, Jan. 20, 2023, in Sarasota, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/700a7e3e-1475-46c6-a43e-572aea5df5f3_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A student makes her way past the sign at New College of Florida, Jan. 20, 2023, in Sarasota, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, File)</span></div>
<p>In early February, the AAUP <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.aaup.org/news/time-now-resist-political-interference">spoke out</a> about what it said were attempts to control "what may be said, taught, or thought" in American colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>It pointed to hearings at the U.S. Congress in December that brought the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania to Washington. They each were asked if they would punish speech calling for genocide against the Jewish people.</p>
<p>In the days and weeks after the hearing, the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard stepped down from their jobs. Some said the answers they gave to Congress played a part.</p>
<p>At first, Harvard president Claudine Gay received support from a number of Harvard professors. But she decided to leave her job after being accused of <strong>plagiarism</strong> in her academic writing. After Gay left her position, the AAUP spoke out about the way influential people worked to push her out.</p>
<p>Irene Mulvey is the head of AAUP. She said the way Gay was pushed out of her job "(did) not <strong>bode</strong> well for academic freedom."</p>
<p><strong>Research into New College of Florida</strong></p>
<p>On February 26, AAUP released a statement about its concerns over academic freedom. It said actions at the New College of Florida, a small school in Florida's State University System, did not meet "widely accepted <strong>standards</strong> of academic government."</p>
<p>The group said Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, had changed the college's top leadership group to restrict academic freedom. AAUP described some of the changes that began in early 2023 in a report released last December. The report is called "Political Interference and Academic Freedom in Florida's Public Higher Education System."</p>
<p>After studying the report, AAUP's top leaders, known as the governing council, voted to speak out against, or <strong>sanction</strong>, what it called "an <strong>unprecedented</strong> politically motivated takeover" of the school. The group has only sanctioned 12 other universities in its history.</p>
<p>The December report said DeSantis targeted New College of Florida because he believed it was too "woke." The report says conservatives now define the word as: "politically liberal or progressive...especially in a way that is considered unreasonable or extreme."</p>
<p>The governor appointed a group of six new people to the college's board of trustees. The board is a college or university's top leadership group.</p>
<p>That group pushed out New College of Florida's president and worked to restrict the kinds of study programs the school could offer. The new trustees also worked to change the way professors applied for tenure, which guarantees those who have it a job for life. Many of the new trustees had written papers and made comments criticizing critical race theory (CRT). The theory centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the country's institutions and that most social interactions can be explained by race.</p>
<p>The board members also spoke against DEI, or diversity, equity and inclusion, a movement aiming to change how society is made up.</p>
<p><strong>No longer safe</strong></p>
<p>One law professor in Florida, LeRoy Pernell, told AAUP what was happening in the state was a "reign of terror." Pernell teaches law at Florida A&amp;M University. That term was first used to describe the French Revolution, which took place more than 225 years ago.</p>
<p>New College is a state school, which means Florida provides part of its <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/harvard-president-s-ouster-leads-to-concerns-about-academic-freedom/7427004.html">budget</a> and it is governed under state laws. For years, New College had been permitted to be "<strong>quirky</strong>." That means it welcomed students and professors who had unusual interests and wanted to follow study programs outside of normal ones.</p>
<p>Many students who felt uncomfortable at more traditional colleges went to New College of Florida and said they felt happy and safe. LBGTQ students say they chose the school because it was open to those who did not follow traditional sexual or gender ideas.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Leininger is a science professor. In a 2023 story, she called New College "one of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/small-florida-college-worries-about-government-involvement/7037843.html#comments">most unique places</a> ... that exists in American higher education."</p>
<p>The AAUP talked with professors at other Florida universities who said they were concerned about the changes at New College of Florida. They said professors are worried about their own ability to seek academic freedom. Some are looking for jobs in other states.</p>
<p>Carolyne Ali-Khan is an education professor at the University of North Florida. "These governmental attacks from the State of Florida have made us unsafe," she told the AAUP.</p>
<p>Kenneth Nunn is a former law professor at the University of Florida. He said good job candidates who are Black are no longer considering Florida schools, "because they see attacks on CRT as attacks on what they do."</p>
<p><strong>What comes next?</strong></p>
<p>In its report, the AAUP said it offered the chancellor, or top leader, of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fldoe.org/schools/higher-ed/fl-college-system/about-us/colleges.stml" target="_blank">Florida College System</a>, a chance to present Florida's side of the story. The chancellor, Kathy Hebda, said no because, she said, the AAUP would not "fairly and fully consider any testimony."</p>
<p>When the sanction came out, a representative from New College of Florida noted that the AAUP's decision has no ability to force changes or prevent a university from operating. In a statement to the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, New College spokesman Nathan March called the report an attempt to get attention.</p>
<p>The AAUP did say it is not too late to prevent what happened at New College of Florida from happening in other places.</p>
<p>"The time for intervention has not passed—yet. We call on all professional organizations, unions, faculty, students, staff, administrators, and communities across the country to fight such "reforms"," it wrote. The group called academic freedom an important part of democratic societies.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>In life, there are times when we must tell others about their bad behavior or unsafe actions. Sometimes that means giving them a strongly worded warning or <strong>scolding </strong>them. We can also <u>read them the riot act.</u></p>
<p>A riot is a violent public disorder. And that is where the expression comes from.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Students clash with riot police in front of the Greek Parliament during a demonstration against the government's plans for private universities, in Athens, Feb. 1, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>The <em>Merriam-Webster</em> online dictionary says it dates back to the early 1700s England, when opponents of King George I began a series of protests.</p>
<p>The British government wanted to stop the protests. So, they passed a law called the "Riot Act." It permitted officials to break up gatherings of 12 or more people by reading a speech out-loud. If the protestors did not leave, they would be guilty of a crime punishable by death. By 1819, "riot act" was also being used more generally for any severe warning or <strong>reprimand.</strong></p>
<p>The law is no longer enforced <strong>across the pond</strong>, as we sometimes refer to Britain. But the term <u>to read the riot act</u> is still alive and well today.</p>
<p>We read someone the riot act to severely scold them. Reading the riot act can include some shouting – and, in fact, often does.</p>
<p>We can use this expression in just about any situation where someone has made a big mistake – at work, with our friends, and with our family.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear it used between two friendly coworkers who are talking about a family situation.</p>
<p><em>A: Wow, who was that on the phone? I could hear her yelling at you all the way over here. </em></p>
<p><em>B: It was my aunt reading me the riot act. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Why? What did you do?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, I forgot to go to her house for dinner last night. And she made all my favorite dishes.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Oh. That is a big mistake. I'm not surprised she read you the riot act. </em></p>
<p><em>B: And it was her birthday.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Oh wow. I'm surprised she is still speaking to you.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I know! I feel awful! So, to make it up to her, I'm taking her out to dinner at a restaurant that serves HER favorite dishes. </em></p>
<p>If VOA Learning English stopped teaching English, our listeners would have every right to read us the riot act.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories.</em></p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>In Cyprus, Former Pilot Makes Halloumi Cheese the Old Ways  (2024/3/2)</title>

<span class="datetime">01 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>On a recent cold winter night in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, long lines of people began to form in a public parking area. The crowd was gathering for the arrival of cheesemaker Pantelis Panteli and the load of Halloumi he had for sale.</p>
<p>Panteli is a relative newcomer to the tradition of Halloumi-making. He had a career as a pilot with Cyprus Airways until 2013, He lost the job as the former company started closing down. Panteli decided to try a very different line of work: cheese-making. The man had found his new career.</p>
<p>But, now the newcomer has become an unlikely defender of traditional cheese-making for Cyprus's prized Halloumi.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pantelis Panteli (R) and a worker prepare halloumi on his farm in Kokkinotrimithia, Cyprus February 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-2a0e-08dc37c92cd7_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pantelis Panteli (R) and a worker prepare halloumi on his farm in Kokkinotrimithia, Cyprus February 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou)</span></div>
<p>The European Union named Halloumi a product of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in 2021. That means that only approved producers from Cyprus can market the cheese under that name. In exchange for the PDO, Cyprus agreed to increase the quantity of ewe or goat milk to just over 50 percent by July 2024.</p>
<p>But Cypriot farmers are protesting the agreement over a dispute about the <strong>ingredients</strong>. Industry <strong>stakeholders</strong> say ewe and goat's milk is highly seasonal, and could therefore affect production levels. Cheese makers had threatened to shut their operations because there was not enough milk. And cattle-raising farmers were angered at the threat to the milk cow market.</p>
<p>So Cyprus officials now plan to delay the agreement to 2029.</p>
<p><strong>Halloumi debate</strong></p>
<p>Soft, rubbery Halloumi can be eaten raw. There are also many ways to cook it --- over a fire or heated in liquid or oil. The cheese keeps its shape well in cooking. It is a popular food and the island's second largest export. Medicines are first.</p>
<p>But there is a dispute within Cyprus about what makes true Halloumi cheese. Should it be made from cow's milk which has a <strong>mellower</strong> taste? Or should it be made from goat and ewe milk, as traditionalists argue?</p>
<p>Panteli started making Halloumi with guidance from a family member. "It was all trial and error with a small pot, then a bigger pot - and just like Steve Jobs - in our <strong>garage</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>He uses ewe's milk to make his Halloumi. He cooks the milk in <strong>rennet</strong> which thickens the liquid to a solid form called a curdle. After resting, curdles are cut and reheated. Panteli adds salt and puts them in a solution called brine for a few hours. Then, they are done and he prepares for market.</p>
<p>Panteli only has a permit to sell directly to <strong>consumers</strong>. And he is limited to producing 150 liters of milk a day.</p>
<p>But his product is popular. He makes videos on TikTok and the social media service X to let people know where to find him. He usually sells all his cheese within two hours of opening sales.</p>
<p>"Nobody is making the real thing anymore, and that is our aim," Panteli said. He spoke to the Reuters news agency while standing near about 300 noisy sheep at his farm west of Nicosia.</p>
<p>But some farmers on the Mediterranean island say that Panteli's method is not workable for all.</p>
<p>Nicos Papakyriakou is head of the organization that represents cow farmers. He said that based on an older 1985 trade agreement, Halloumi cheese is made out of not only goat and ewes' milk but cows' milk as well.</p>
<p>He says the mellow taste of cows' milk has permitted Halloumi to capture overseas markets. "The PDO says it should smell like a farm," he said. He questioned if people would buy it if it smelled "like goats!"</p>

            <title>Report: Harmful Waste Creation Set to Increase  (2024/3/2)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">01 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said in a report on Wednesday that public waste creation will greatly increase by 2050. The rise will cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage through <strong>biodiversity</strong> loss, climate change, and deadly pollution, UNEP reports.</p>
<p>UNEP's Global Waste Management Outlook 2024 says worldwide waste creation would greatly increase unless governments take urgent preventative measures. The world's fastest-growing economies will drive much of the increase in waste. These include some countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that are already struggling to deal with current public waste levels.</p>
<p>The report predicts municipal solid waste generation will grow from 2.3 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050. UNEP projected the yearly cost of waste treatment by the middle of the century would rise to $640 billion worldwide. That represents a more than 75 percent increase from 2020. That year, the world produced an estimated 2.1 billion tonnes of public solid waste, which excludes industrial waste.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman walks through a landfill looking for salvageable items, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Saturday, July 1, 2023.

(AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)</span></div>
<p>Damage caused by the growing waste would account for about $443 billion of the total cost.</p>
<p>The report, called <em>Beyond an Age of Waste: Turning Rubbish into a Resource</em>, was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Kenya this week. The writers argue that humanity has "moved backwards" over the past ten years. They say humans are creating more waste, more pollution, and more climate changing gases.</p>
<p>Waste prevention measures and improved waste treatment could reduce those costs, the report said. But it notes, there are major barriers to such reforms, including weak enforcement systems.</p>
<p>Negotiators are working toward a treaty to deal with the especially damaging and dangerous pollution from plastics. They are beginning a fourth round of talks in April. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said she is hopeful they will complete the agreement by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Environmentalists and <strong>fossil fuel</strong> producers continue to disagree about the terms of the agreement. They especially dispute whether the deal should center on reducing plastics production or increasing <strong>recycling </strong>and re-use.</p>
<p>"There is an interest, and especially among the countries that are producing raw polymer, but as I keep telling them, this is not an anti-plastic treaty," Andersen told Reuters, noting there would still be a need for plastics in vehicles and medical equipment.</p>
<p>Raw polymers are used in the creation of plastic materials.</p>
<p>Andersen said she hopes no delegations would work to block progress on the treaty, but instead "find a way forward that actually takes into account the fact that we are drowning in plastic."</p>

<p>Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher, we answer a question from Mequanent Antigegn.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>"Must vs have to"--I find it difficult to differentiate them.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="'Must' or 'Have To'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-a3df-08dc396cb585_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">'Must' or 'Have To'</span></div>
<p><em>You must wear your <strong>uniform</strong> in the classroo</em>m. Or <em>You have to wear your uniform in the classroom</em>.</p>
<p>Which one is correct?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for this question. "Must" and "have to" can have the same meaning. We have talked about "must" and "have to" in an earlier <em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/ask-a-teacher-must-and-have-to/4686883.html" target="_blank">Ask a Teacher</a></em>.</p>
<p>Both of the sentences you provide are correct. Sometimes it is better to choose "must" over "have to" or "have to" over "must."</p>
<p><strong>Must</strong></p>
<p>When we use must in spoken English, usually it is to express something we think is likely. In that case, it is similar in meaning to the word "probably."</p>
<p><em>You <u>must</u> be cold after working all day in the rain.</em></p>
<p>You are probably cold after working all day in the rain.</p>
<p><em>My supervisor <u>must</u> not care about the budget cuts.</em></p>
<p>My supervisor probably doesn't care about the budget cuts.</p>
<p>But, we also use it as we use "have to," although more commonly in writing.</p>
<p><em>Climate change <u>must</u> be stopped.</em></p>
<p><em>You <u>must</u> see the doctor before Friday.</em></p>
<p><strong>Have to</strong></p>
<p>"Have to," "have got to" and its reduced form "gotta," are used very often in spoken language to communicate requirement.</p>
<p><em>I <u>have to</u> get up at 5am tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><em>You <u>gotta</u> relax.</em></p>
<p>So, which sentence should you use? It depends on the context. Are you wanting to express a probability? Or are you trying to give an order or announce a rule?</p>
<p>And now we must say goodbye! We have to check the mail for new questions about American English! If you have one, send us an email at learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Ask a Teacher</em>.</p>
<p>I'm Gena Bennett.</p>

            <title>In Dubai, a Race for ‘Iron Men’ Wearing Jet Suits  (2024/3/1)</title>

<p>The pilots started their jet engines on a runway in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai on Wednesday. But they were not preparing to fly an aircraft. They themselves would fly — in the first-ever "jet suit race."</p>
<p>The seven pilots with jet engines on their backs raced along the tall buildings of Dubai like a <strong>scene</strong> from the movie <em>Iron Man</em>.</p>
<p>"The closest <strong>analogy</strong> would be that dream of flying... and then going wherever your mind is taking you," said Richard Browning. He is the founder and chief test pilot for Gravity Industries, the company that held the race with Dubai.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Jet suit pilots race in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024.

Dubai on Wednesday hosted what it called its first-ever jet suit race. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell)</span></div>
<p>Browning added that the movie created the scene using computer technology, but his company did it "for real."</p>
<p>The pilots wore 1,500-<strong>horsepower</strong> jet suits for the race. Those engines have more mechanical power than most sports cars and use the same fuel as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 passenger jets.</p>
<p>Then came what pilot Issa Kalfon called "the moment of truth." The engines <strong>roared</strong> and pilots jumped and <strong>leaned</strong> forward. And they took off like a helicopter.</p>
<p>Organizers said they took off from the runway next to the water to enable higher speeds. The jet suit currently can reach speeds of 128 kilometers an hour, Gravity Industries said. It is also safer for the pilots to fly short distances above water.</p>
<p>Kalfon, who won the race, said he was nervous before his flight. "Everything's hot, it's running, the engines are screaming at you," Kalfon said. But he said the jet suit was safe and easy to <strong>handle</strong>.</p>
<p>There was one crash during Wednesday's race.</p>
<p>Emirati pilot Ahmed al-Shehhi smashed into the water, going feet first but immediately came to the surface to give a <strong>thumbs-up</strong> to rescuers. An announcer described him as having just 12 days of training before the race.</p>
<p>"It's pretty amazing to see that they can do this in Dubai, and they have these guys flying over the water," said Jennifer Ross, an American who lives in Dubai. "It's kind of like astronauts flying around in space."</p>
<p>With its beaches, bars and buildings, Dubai has long been a city known for its love of aviation. The city is home to the world's busiest airport for international travel. It also has been developing the idea of flying taxis for several years.</p>
<p>There are risks to jet suit travel, however.</p>
<p>In 2020, Vincent Reffet died in a crash during training for a different flying project. He was famous for once flying alongside a two-level Emirates A380 jet.</p>

<p>The Svalbard Global Seed <strong>Vault</strong> is on an island halfway between Europe and the North Pole. It contains frozen seeds of food crops from around the world.</p>
<p>The vault opened in 2008 to help keep crops safe from <strong>extinction</strong>.</p>
<p>This week, the vault received seeds from the largest number of new <strong>contributors</strong> ever. Contributors give seeds from their collections of seeds, called seed banks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The entrance to the international gene bank Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) is pictured outside Longyearbyen on Spitsbergen, Norway, February 29, 2016.

<p>Twenty-three seed banks took part, nine of them for the first time. The new contributors came from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria and Zambia.</p>
<p>Crop Trust is a non-profit group that operates the vault along with Norwegian officials. Crop Trust said the boxes of seeds arrived on Tuesday. They contained crop seeds such as beans, barley, cowpea, maize, rice, millet and sorghum.</p>
<p>Stefan Schmitz is Executive Director of Crop Trust. He said that keeping the seeds frozen in the Arctic helps <strong>guarantee</strong> food security for the future.</p>
<p>The vault is set in permafrost caves. The seeds are kept at temperatures around -18 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Between 2015 and 2019, the vault helped rebuild seed collections that were damaged during the war in Syria.</p>
<p>Crop Trust said many of the seeds given on Tuesday were the result of a worldwide 10-year <strong>biodiversity</strong> project known as BOLD. The project aims to support <strong>global</strong> food and nutrition security, the trust added.</p>
<p>Norway's ministry of agriculture and food said 111 seed banks in 77 countries now have crop seeds in Svalbard.</p>
<p>The Crop Trust website says the vault currently has over 1 million seed <strong>samples</strong>. It also says the vault has room to hold 4.5 million varieties of crops.</p>

            <title>US Army Announces New Structure, Reduced Positions  (2024/3/1)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>The U.S. Army recently announced new structuring plans for its forces. The plans involve cutting many unfilled jobs after hiring efforts failed to bring in enough soldiers to fill all job openings.</p>
<p>The Army is cutting about 24,000, or almost 5 percent, of jobs, and restructuring to be better prepared for the future.</p>
<p>The cuts will mainly be in already-unoccupied jobs — not soldiers. These include jobs related to <strong>counterinsurgency</strong>. Those jobs grew in number during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. About 3,000 of the cuts would come from Army special operations forces.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - U.S. Army soldiers march during a joint military drill of South Korea and the United States in Paju, South Korea, Friday, Jan. 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/58bd1b1d-e517-4feb-b82b-ca91a47ddda7_cx8_cy4_cw88_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - U.S. Army soldiers march during a joint military drill of South Korea and the United States in Paju, South Korea, Friday, Jan. 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)</span></div>
<p>However, the new plan will add about 7,500 troops in other missions. These include air-defense and counter-drone units and five new task forces around the world with increased <strong>cyber-</strong>, intelligence and long-distance strike capabilities.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said she and General Randy George, the Army chief, reduced the number of openings.</p>
<p>"We're moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. We want to be<strong> postured</strong> for large-scale combat operations," Wormuth told reporters recently. "So, we looked at where were there pieces of force structure that were probably more associated with counterinsurgency, for example, that we don't need anymore."</p>
<p>George added that Army leaders did a lot of careful study to choose the places to cut.</p>
<p>"The things that we want to not have in our <strong>formation</strong> are actually things that we don't think are going to make us successful on the battlefield going forward," he said.</p>
<p>An Army document said the cuts are "spaces" not "faces," and the Army will not be asking soldiers to leave the force.</p>
<p>Instead, the decision reflects the reality that for years the Army has not been able to fill thousands of empty jobs. While the Army can have up to 494,000 soldiers, the total number of active-duty soldiers right now is about 445,000. Under the new plan, the goal is to bring in enough troops over the next five years to reach a level of 470,000.</p>
<p>The measures come after more than 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan forced the Army to change. The changes included counterinsurgency forces to fight al-Qaida, the Taliban, and the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>The military's attention has moved to "great power competition" from countries such as China and Russia, and threats from Iran and North Korea. The war in Ukraine has shown the need for greater attention to air-defense systems and the latest ways to use and to counter <strong>drones</strong> in the air and in the sea.</p>
<p>Army leaders said they looked carefully at all the service's job specialties in search of places to cut. They examined the ongoing effort to modernize the Army with new high-technology weapons and to make decisions about additional forces.</p>
<p>The changes are partly a result of the <strong>recruiting</strong> problems all military services are facing.</p>
<p>In the last U.S. government budget year, which ended September 30, the Navy, Army, and Air Force all failed to meet their recruitment goals. The Marine Corps and the very small Space Force did meet their goals. The Army recruited a little over 50,000 soldiers, falling short of the publicly stated goal of 65,000.</p>

<p>There was a time when activists and reporters in Cuba had to speak in <strong>code</strong> or meet in European embassies to avoid government observation.</p>
<p>Now, the internet and <strong>encrypted</strong> messaging services offers some assistance. But as technology has made private communicating easier, Havana has found ways to interfere with, or block, messages.</p>
<p>Cuba's independent reporters<strong> </strong>take care to protect their phones so they do not go into the hands of officials. If government agents seize an individual's phone, they will search through its data for evidence of wrongdoing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Young people use a hotspot to connect to the internet, in Havana, Cuba, June 06, 2019. " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9f463533-913f-46cb-8ac7-0b17585bf44a_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Young people use a hotspot to connect to the internet, in Havana, Cuba, June 06, 2019. </span></div>
<p>The Cuban Institute for Freedom of Expression and Press, or ICLEP, says it documented at least 210 incidents of internet restriction cases in the country in 2023.</p>
<p>Those restrictions can include cutting internet <strong>access</strong>, blocking social media sites, or <strong>hacking</strong> the accounts of reporters or the media websites they work for, the ICLEP report found.</p>
<p>Normando Hernandez is founder and director general of Miami, Florida-based ICLEP. He said the government tries to "silence independent journalists."</p>
<p>"It is historically well known that the Cuban state listens and spies on all the <strong>conversations</strong> it wants to," Hernandez said. "Cubans have no way to defend themselves against any <strong>breach</strong> of their rights."</p>
<p>Reporter Henry Constantin says his internet was cut suddenly after La Hora de Cuba, the media site for which he works, began criticizing the Cuban government.</p>
<p>La Hora de Cuba is published on Facebook and Instagram. Its team of 15 reporters has an audience of between 46,000 and 48,000 on social media.</p>
<p>Constantin says disconnecting journalists' telephone lines or internet access is designed to limit free speech. Hernandez said the government controls all access to digital expression.</p>
<p>Havana controls the Cuban telecommunications company ETECSA, which controls all digital communications on the island.</p>
<p>Access to the network for users represents both a threat to Havana and an instrument of control for officials. But with that control, said Hernandez, officials can easily "cut communication in general at historically important moments ... or when something is happening in the island of interest to Cuban society."</p>
<p>That appears to be the case with Constantin.</p>
<p>In 2021, he was detained for 10 days for public disorder after reporting on demonstrations against the government over food shortages and medicinal problems.</p>
<p>ICLEP has documented digital <strong>harassment</strong> since 2016.</p>
<p>In 2021, the activity was especially strong. ICLEP documented 1,129 violations of freedom of expression that year. During that year, protests against the Cuban government and Communist Party were the biggest since the 1959 revolution.</p>
<p>Prisoners Defenders International is a Spain-based human rights group. It said Cuba's government has been spying on reporters and activists for many years. Javier Larrondo is president of Prisoners Defenders. He said the government monitors text messages for "sensitive words."</p>
<p>Using encrypted services like WhatsApp or Telegram is not always enough. When reporters or opposition activists are arrested, their phones are always seized and the memory inspected by experts.</p>
<p>"As such, it is <strong>essential</strong> never to go out with a mobile phone but to leave it at home, hidden." Or to go out with a second phone without memory, he said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>Every year, the Recording Academy in the United States gives awards to the performers and songwriters with the most outstanding <strong>achievements</strong> from the year before. The Academy calls those awards "the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/GrammyAward/c4cf1e8a33aa407e81a41363730f51da">Grammys</a>."</p>
<p>At the 2024 Grammy awards, the Song of the Year award went to Miley Cyrus for her song <em>Flowers</em>. In today's lesson, we will look at some grammar rules Cyrus follows in the song and one rule she breaks. The song begins with the story of a break-up:</p>
<p><em>We were good, we were gold</em><br/>
<em>Kinda dream that can't be sold</em><br/>
<em>We were right 'til we weren't</em><br/>
<em>Built a home and watched it burn</em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Breaking the Ruke With Miley Cyrus' 'Flowers'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-b31f-08dc37a9b0c2_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Breaking the Ruke With Miley Cyrus' 'Flowers'</span></div>
<p><em>Mm, I didn't wanna leave you</em><br/>
<em>I didn't wanna lie</em><br/>
<em>Started to cry, but then remembered I... </em></p>
<p>In this first part, Cyrus uses an informal adverb, "kinda," to describe the dream she and her partner had. In formal language, she would say, "It was the <em>kind of</em> dream that can't be sold." We expect to hear informal language in songs, so this is not really breaking any rules.</p>
<p>She follows with another informal word, the verb form "wanna," in "I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie." It is very common to hear this pronunciation in spoken English of the words "want to."</p>
<p><strong>Reflexive pronoun rule</strong></p>
<p>Next, we get to where Cyrus follows and breaks the same rule. She describes the expressive actions of a romantic partner that she can do for herself. Her song tells us about the kinds of things a romantic partner might do, but Cyrus says she, as an independent woman, can do those things without the partner.</p>
<p>Listen for the <strong>reflexive</strong> pronoun "myself" in these lines:</p>
<p><em>I can buy myself flowers</em></p>
<p><em>Write my name in the sand</em></p>
<p><em>Talk to myself for hours</em></p>
<p><em>Say things you don't understand</em></p>
<p><em>I can take myself dancing</em></p>
<p><em>And I can hold my own hand</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</em></p>
<p>Did you catch the place where she broke the rule about when to use a reflexive pronoun? The rule is: when the object and the subject of the verb are the same, use the reflexive pronoun to describe the object.</p>
<p>Cyrus follows this rule when she sings, "I can buy myself flowers," "talk to myself for hours" and "I can take myself dancing." But she breaks it when she sings, "I can love me better than you can."</p>
<p>Let's take a moment for a little quiz here. Can you say or sing the same line with the reflexive pronoun? Take a moment so you can think.</p>
<p>Following the rule, this should be "I can love myself better than you can." Cyrus probably uses "me" to match the beat of the music. Often, that is more important to singers than following grammar rules!</p>
<p><strong>Adjective "own"</strong></p>
<p>In one line of the song, Cyrus uses the adjective "own" to refer to things belonging to herself. Let's listen to that line:</p>
<p>And I can hold my own hand</p>
<p>Here, "own" is correct because it makes the action clear. If she had not used "own," we might not understand. She could be singing about holding her hand up, for example. "Hold my own hand" makes it clear to us that she is using one hand to hold another.</p>
<p>What do you think of Miley Cyrus' song? Are there any singers in your country who sing about their independence in this way?</p>
<p>Write to us at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com">learningenglish@voanews.com</a> and tell us about them.</p>
<p>And that's Everyday Grammar!</p>

<p>Internet search companies have already built artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their systems. And the use of AI systems to support internet searches is expected to grow sharply in coming years.</p>
<p>Some technology experts feel this change can greatly improve the overall search experience for users. But experts also have concerns.</p>
<p>One early user, or adopter, of AI search is Google. The American-based company's search engine currently processes an estimated 80 percent of the world's internet search requests.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Google logos are shown when searched on Google in New York, Sept. 11, 2023. Google said Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024,. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-eb47-08dc37e441aa_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Google logos are shown when searched on Google in New York, Sept. 11, 2023. Google said Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024,. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>Microsoft's search engine Bing also includes AI-powered results. Bing's AI system is linked to the company's Copilot service. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/copilot">Copilot</a> is an AI tool designed to operate across a series of Microsoft business products.</p>
<p>Copilot is based on OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in late 2022. ChatGPT is a computer-powered AI tool designed to interact smoothly with humans.</p>
<p>Such AI tools – known as "chatbots" or "generative AI" – are trained on massive amounts of internet data. They have shown an ability to perform human-level writing and create high-quality images and videos based on short, written descriptions.</p>
<p>But these AI systems have also demonstrated possible risks. One risk is the tools can present false or misleading information as truth. They can also produce results that represent long-standing biases against minorities or underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>Here, we offer some guidance for users seeking new systems to provide improved and <strong>relevant</strong> search results.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I find AI search tools?</strong></p>
<p>Some major search companies have made it easy to find AI search engines on their main search pages.</p>
<p>Google's search system is powered by its own chatbot tool, called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini</a>. It can easily be found directly on desktop or mobile phone browsers. Gemini can be used to perform other chatbot actions as well as providing search assistance.</p>
<p>Google also has been testing a new search offering, called "Search Generative Experience." It replaces links with AI-produced briefs containing basic facts about a subject. This system is currently limited to U.S. users who sign up through Google's experimental Labs site.</p>
<p>To use AI with Microsoft's Bing search engine, simply click the Chat or Copilot button underneath the main search window. This should pull up an information box where users can enter their search requests.</p>
<p>New AI search sites have also launched. But they are not as easy to find. The Associated Press reports one way to find them is to perform searches for tools on Copilot or Gemini. Some to look out for include Perplexity, HuggingChat, You.com, Komo, Andi, Phind, Exa and AskAI.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to sign up for or pay for these services?</strong></p>
<p>Most of these services have free versions. But generally, there are limits on how many searches a user can make. Users can also <strong>upgrade</strong> from basic services to higher levels providing smarter AI tools and more search possibilities.</p>
<p>Gemini users, for example, can pay $20 for an upgraded version that offers its "most<strong> capable</strong>" model, called Ultra 1.0.</p>
<p>Most of the startup sites are largely free to use and don't require setting up an account. Many also have upgrade possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>What are the results like?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike a traditional Google search, results from AI tools usually produce a longer, readable collection of information. Sometimes, the <strong>original</strong> source of information is also included. And in some cases, messages are included to warn users about possible misinformation appearing in the results.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to try out different AI tools. Results from each can differ, sometimes wildly. The AP reports that results from AI-assisted search tools can be especially useful when searching for more <strong>obscure</strong> facts or information.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This story is one of the winning entries from the "Teach Us about Ukraine" writing contest sponsored by VOA Learning English and GoGlobal.</em></p>
<p>My name is Liudmyla Shylova and I have been teaching English for 21 years in Nizhyn, Ukraine.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nizhyn pickle monument in Nizhyn, Ukraine. (Courtesy photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-025c-08dc324cfa51_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Nizhyn pickle monument in Nizhyn, Ukraine.

<p>Nizhyn is a small city in northern Ukraine with more than a thousand years of history. But the city is, perhaps, best known for a small food item that can be found around the world: pickles.</p>
<p>If you ever taste Nizhyn pickles, you will understand why that small cucumber represents 300 years of the history, tradition, and taste of Ukrainian cuisine.</p>
<p>In the 17th century, Nizhyn was a Cossack city on the border of the Russian Empire. At that time, some Greeks sailed down the Oster River to escape from the Ottoman occupation. They brought their culture, traditions and, among other things, a recipe for salting cucumbers.</p>
<p>The Greeks valued the rich soil of Nizhyn and grew cucumbers to make pickles. The pickling process took place in wooden barrels that were bought from Nizhyn craftsmen. Their secret recipe contained spices from eastern markets and local water from the artesian springs.</p>
<p>The Greeks also paid much attention to the quality of cucumbers. The vegetables had to be the same size, neither big nor small. This permitted the cucumbers to be evenly salted and have a special crunch.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nizhyn pickles made by the Greeks found their admirers among the Cossacks, local people and even the royals. When Empress Catherine II of Russia traveled south through Nizhyn, she ordered pickles to her table. The Queen of Britain was also known to feast on those crunchy cucumbers.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Nizhyn pickles became popular in many European countries. Traders made a lot of money selling them to people in Denmark, France, Sweden, Germany and Great Britain.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Nizhyn pickles can be found on supermarket shelves all over the world.</p>
<p>The product has since become a part of Ukrainian culture. In 2005, a monument to Ukraine's fruit and vegetable culture was opened near the local food factory. And a Nizhyn pickle was included in the list of winners of an international project on the food culture of Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, welcome to Nizhyn, and go ahead and taste our pickles!</p>

            <title>South Korea’s Fertility Rate Falls Again as Women Worry about Jobs  (2024/2/29) | 韩国生育率再次下降</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202402/south-korea-s-fertility-rate-falls-again-as-women-worry-about-jobs.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>South Korea's fertility rate, which already is the world's lowest, dropped again in 2023.<br/>
韩国的生育率已经是全球最低，但在2023年却再次下降。</p>
<p>This means that the number of babies a South Korean woman is expected to have during her reproductive years dropped from 0.78 in 2022 to 0.72 in 2023.<br/>
这意味着，韩国女性在生育期预计生育的婴儿数量从2022年的0.78下降到2023年的0.72。</p>
<p>Concerns about missing out on long-term jobs and the cost of raising a child are reasons given for the low rate.<br/>
人们担心失去长期工作和抚养孩子的成本是造成低生育率的原因。</p>
<p>The fertility number is much lower than the rate of 2.1 per woman that would be needed to keep South Korea's population stable.<br/>
韩国的生育率远低于保持人口稳定所需的每名女性生育2.1人。</p>
<p>In 2015, when the cost of housing and education were lower, the rate was 1.24. That means South Korea's population has been shrinking for a long time.<br/>
2015年，当住房和教育成本较低时，该比率为1.24。这意味着韩国的人口在很长一段时间内一直在减少。</p>
<p>The South Korean government is trying to encourage men and women to start families. Since 2018, the nation has been the only member of a group of large economies to have a rate below one. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) includes a wide group of nations such as Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand as well as Mexico and Chile.<br/>
韩国政府正在努力鼓励男性和女性组建家庭。自2018年以来，韩国一直是某大型经济体组织中唯一生育率低于1的成员国。经济合作与发展组织包括英国、美国、澳大利亚、新西兰以及墨西哥和智利等众多国家。</p>
<p>Among OECD nations, South Korea has the largest difference in pay between men and women. Balancing motherhood with a job is a concern for South Korean women.<br/>
在经合组织国家中，韩国的男女薪酬差距最大。平衡母亲身份和工作是韩国女性关注的问题。</p>
<p>Jung Jae-hoon is a professor at Seoul Women's University. Jung noted that women have trouble moving their careers forward after taking leave to care for children.<br/>
郑在勋是首尔女子大学的教授。郑指出，女性在请假照顾孩子后，很难推进自己的事业。</p>
<p>An example of this is Gwak Tae-hee who is 34. She is concerned about missing career opportunities if she stops working to start a family. She has been married for three years and works as a manager for a company that makes milk products.<br/>
34岁的郭泰希就是一个例子。她担心如果自己停止工作去生头胎，会失去职业机会。她结婚三年了，在一家生产乳制品的公司担任经理。</p>
<p>"Having a baby is on my list, but there's windows for promotions and I don't want to be passed over," she said.<br/>
她说：“生孩子一直在我的考虑当中，但目前有晋升的机会，我不想被忽略。”</p>
<p>Gwak said she considered starting medical treatments last year that would help her have a child. However, she decided against it because she wanted to take on work projects that would help her career.<br/>
郭说，她去年考虑开始接受有助于受孕的治疗。然而，她决定放弃这样做，因为她想从事有助于她的职业生涯的工作项目。</p>
<p>"I hope it's not too late when I try next year or the year after," Gwak said.<br/>
郭说：“我希望明年或后年尝试时不会太晚。”</p>
<p>If the birth rate continues to drop, South Korea's population of about 51 million will be cut in half by 2100.<br/>
如果出生率继续下降，到2100年，韩国约5100万人口将减少一半。</p>
<p>In Seoul, the largest city and capital, the fertility rate is only 0.55.<br/>
在韩国最大城市和首都首尔，生育率只有0.55。</p>
<p>The nation has an election in April, and politicians have been offering ideas to make it easier for young adults to consider having children. The ideas include more housing and financial support for people thinking of having a family.<br/>
韩国将于4月举行大选，政客们一直在提出让年轻人更容易考虑生孩子的想法。这些想法包括为头胎家庭提供更多的住房和经济支持。</p>
<p>An official at Statistics Korea said there are some people who are a couple but do not get married. In South Korea, many people see marriage as a requirement to have children, so that reduces the number of babies. But the official told Reuters that right now the group is centering its work on trying to help married people feel better about starting families.<br/>
韩国统计局的一位官员说，有些人是情侣，但没有结婚。在韩国，许多人将结婚就要生孩子，所以这样做减少了婴儿的数量。但这位官员告诉路透社，目前该组织的工作重点是帮助已婚人士对生头胎感觉更踏实。</p>
<p>Politicians are worried that additional social spending has not encouraged more families. Since 2006, the government has spent about $270 billion in areas such as helping families pay for childcare, but the fertility numbers are still falling.<br/>
政客们担心，额外的社会支出并不能鼓励更多的家庭。自2006年以来，政府在帮助家庭支付育儿费用等领域花费了约2700亿美元，但生育率仍在下降。</p>
<p>South Korea, however, is not the only nation concerned about falling birth rates. China and Japan also recorded all-time low rates in 2022.<br/>
然而，韩国并不是唯一一个担心出生率下降的国家。2022年，中国和日本的生育率也创下历史新低。</p>

            <title>UN: Famine Is Certain in Gaza without Cease-fire  (2024/2/29)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">28 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>A United Nations official warned Tuesday that the Gaza Strip is at high risk of famine, an extreme lack of food, if the war there does not stop soon.</p>
<p>Ramesh Rajasingham is director of the coordination division in the U.N. <strong>humanitarian</strong> office.</p>
<p>"If nothing is done, we fear widespread famine in Gaza is almost <strong>inevitable</strong>, and the conflict, which since October has claimed the lives of almost 30,000 people and injured more than 70,000 ... will have many more victims," he said.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Displaced Palestinian children wait to receive free food at a tent camp as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 27, 2024. (REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa

)</span></div>
<p>Rajasingham spoke at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council requested by members Algeria, Guyana, Slovenia and Switzerland. There are rising concerns that hunger is being used as a weapon in the war.</p>
<p>Rajasingham said at least 576,000 people in Gaza — 25 percent of the population — are very close to famine. Almost the entire population is depending on food aid to survive, he said.</p>
<p>"Gaza is seeing the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world," said Carl Skau, an official with the U.N.'s World Food Program (WFP).</p>
<p><strong>Agricultural production collapsing</strong></p>
<p>Maurizio Martina is assistant director-general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. He explained how the entire food supply chain has been impacted by the war. He said Israel has forced farmers to leave their land or flee shelling that has destroyed crops. Farm animals are dying from hunger or killed in bombings. Fishing is banned and ground water is polluted.</p>
<p>"In the most likely scenario, agricultural production will have collapsed in the north by May 2024," Martina said. "We are already seeing this collapse."</p>
<p><strong>Flow of aid 'unpredictable,' 'insufficient'</strong></p>
<p>Martin Griffiths is the U.N. humanitarian chief. He said humanitarians continue to face serious difficulties in providing aid.</p>
<p>"These include border crossing closures, serious movement restrictions, access denials, <strong>onerous</strong> <strong>vetting</strong> procedures, security risks, incidents by desperate civilians, a breakdown of law and order, and restrictions on communications and protective equipment," Griffiths wrote.</p>
<p>Israel denies it is restricting or limiting the delivery of aid to Gaza.</p>
<p>"Israel is doing all it can to care for civilians, going above and beyond what is expected, let alone required," Israel's deputy U.N. envoy Jonathan Miller told the council.</p>
<p>Miller said Israel has helped the delivery of 254,000 tons of relief supplies into Gaza since the start of the war, including 165,000 tons of food. He blamed Hamas for <strong>diverting</strong> aid and the U.N. for failing to properly manage and distribute it.</p>
<p><strong>Famine 'imminent' in northern Gaza</strong></p>
<p>The situation is most serous in northern Gaza, which remains cut off by the Israeli military.</p>
<p>About 300,000 people are believed to have ignored Israel's earlier <strong>evacuation</strong> order and remained through months of heavy fighting between the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas.</p>
<p>"If nothing changes, a famine is <strong>imminent</strong> in northern Gaza," WFP's Skau said.</p>
<p>The U.N. agency that assists Palestinians, UNRWA, delivers most of the relief supplies. It says the last time it was able to get food aid to northern Gaza was on January 23. On February 20, the World Food Program suspended its deliveries to the north because of a lack of security in the area. The World Health Organization last reached Gaza City's largest hospital, Al Shifa, on January 22 with medical supplies.</p>
<p>One week ago, the 15-nation Security Council failed to pass an agreement calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire because of a veto from the United States. Several council members repeated their call for a cease-fire at Tuesday's meeting.</p>
<p>Even Israel's closest ally, the United States, displayed its growing displeasure with the slow delivery of aid. It urged Israel to keep border crossings open and to open new ones.</p>
<p>"Simply put, Israel must do more," Ambassador Robert Wood said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>A long-term study in China has shown that a series of changes take place in the brains of people who get Alzheimer's disease long before they present signs of the sickness.</p>
<p>The large study followed middle-aged and older adults for 20 years. The individuals were examined on a regular basis during that period. The researchers used brain imaging, spinal fluid checks and other tools to collect data.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that the study subjects who later developed Alzheimer's showed high levels of disease-linked protein in their spinal fluid. The higher levels were recorded as much as 18 years before the patients were identified as having Alzheimer's.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A closeup of a human brain affected by Alzheimer's disease, is displayed at the Museum of Neuroanatomy at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, in 2003. (AP Photo/David Duprey)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/dfb2f56e-4c19-401f-a6c2-e3d302c2b837_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A closeup of a human brain affected by Alzheimer's disease, is displayed at the Museum of Neuroanatomy at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, in 2003.

<p>Then every few years, the study <strong>detected</strong> another so-called biomarker of coming trouble.</p>
<p>Scientists still do not know exactly how Alzheimer's forms. The disease slowly destroys the brain, interfering with the ability to think. Alzheimer's patients develop proteins called beta-amyloid and tau, which over time build up into <strong>plaques</strong> that block brain processes.</p>
<p>The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers a timeline for how these proteins develop.</p>
<p>The study's importance "cannot be overstated," said Dr. Richard Mayeux, an Alzheimer's specialist at Columbia University who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>"Knowledge of the timing of these <strong>physiological</strong> events is critical" for testing new ways of treating and maybe even preventing Alzheimer's, he wrote in a piece published alongside the study report.</p>
<p>Scientists already knew that in rare, genetic forms of Alzheimer's that affect young people, a poisonous form of amyloid starts developing about 20 years ahead of symptoms. At some point after that, tau develops as well.</p>
<p>The new findings show the order of such biomarker changes common to age-related Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Researchers with Beijing's Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders compared 648 people who were later found with Alzheimer's to an equal number who remained healthy. The amyloid finding in future Alzheimer's patients was the main discovery.</p>
<p>Differences in tau were found next, followed by a marker of trouble in how neurons communicate. A few years after that, the study found differences in brain shrinkage and <strong>cognitive</strong> test scores between the two groups.</p>
<p>"The more we know about <strong>viable</strong> Alzheimer's treatment targets and when to address them, the better and faster we will be able to develop new <strong>therapies</strong> and preventions," said Claire Sexton, director of scientific programs with the Alzheimer's Association. She noted that blood tests are coming soon that promise to also help by making it easier to find amyloid and tau.</p>
<p>More than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. There is no cure.</p>
<p>But last year, Leqembi became the first approved drug that could slow the worsening of early Alzheimer's for a few months. The drug works by clearing away some of the amyloid protein. Other drugs are being developed to target tau.</p>

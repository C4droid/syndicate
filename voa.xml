        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>AI Tool Aims to Predict Virus Variants before They Appear  (2023/10/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Scientists have created an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that aims to predict different virus versions, called variants, before they appear.</p>
<p>Creators of the tool say it works by estimating the likelihood that a variant will permit it to escape the body's own <strong>immunity</strong> defenses.</p>
<p>The tool is called EVEscape. It works by processing collected data on the development, or evolution, of a virus over time. The system also considers detailed biological and structural information related to the virus.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (NIAID-RML via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3874-08dbd580cc27_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">
This image provided by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (NIAID-RML via AP)</span></div>
<p>The method is a form of "generative AI," a term describing technology tools designed to operate at human levels. EVEscape was developed by researchers from Britain's University of Oxford and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. The team's findings recently appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06617-0">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>Many viruses repeatedly <strong>mutate</strong> in an effort to stay alive and strong. This requires viruses to infect living organisms. Once inside the body, viruses continue to reproduce and spread.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html">explains</a> that repeated mutating creates new variants. Some of these mutations permit the virus "to spread more easily or make it resistant to treatments or vaccines," the CDC said.</p>
<p>The researchers built on previous work involving a tool they created called EVE. This tool was designed to study gene mutations that can cause human disease. In a past study, the team said it successfully used EVE to identify mutations linked to conditions like cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientists said they recognized a good chance to "rebuild" EVE into a new tool "for the purpose of predicting viral variants."</p>
<p>To do this, the team <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/ai-tool-can-help-forecast-viral-outbreaks">explained</a> it "turned the clock back to January 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic started." The researchers asked the EVEscape tool to predict what mutations would develop from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The researchers reported the tool correctly predicted which SARS-CoV-2 mutations would appear and which would become most common, or dominant.</p>
<p>The team also <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/ai-tool-can-help-forecast-viral-outbreaks">said</a> the tool predicted which antibody-based treatments "would lose their efficacy as the pandemic progressed and the virus developed mutations to escape these treatments."</p>
<p>The study noted EVEscape can make predictions more quickly and effectively than lab-based methods. This is because the tool does not need "to wait for <strong>relevant</strong> antibodies to arise in the population and become available for testing."</p>
<p>The team said the system was able to examine tens of thousands of new virus variants appearing each week and identified the ones most likely to become problematic.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurev is a student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technoology (MIT). She was a leader of the research. Gurev said that by quickly identifying the threat level of new variants, "we can help inform earlier public health decisions."</p>
<p>The team said it continuously uses the system to examine real-time data about the development of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. It then shares this information with the public and international agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The researchers said their experiments also showed the EVEscape tool could successfully predict mutating behaviors for other common viruses, including HIV and the flu.</p>
<p>Debora Marks is a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School's Blavatnik Institute. She was a lead writer of the study. She said the researchers would continue to improve the tool's ability to predict new variants for a number of viruses. "Because if we can, that's going to be extremely important for designing vaccines and <strong>therapies</strong>."</p>

            <title>Study: Part of Antarctica to Experience ‘Unavoidable’ Melt  (2023/10/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>A new study says that no matter how much the world cuts back on carbon <strong>emissions</strong>, a large and important part of Antarctica is expected to disappear.</p>
<p>Researchers used computer models to predict the future melting of protective ice around Antarctica's Amundsen Sea in western Antarctica. They said the "unavoidable" melting will take hundreds of years. It will slowly add nearly 1.8 meters to sea levels. And it will be enough to reshape where and how people live in the future.</p>
<p>The study was published recently in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/nclimate/"><em>Nature Climate Change</em></a>. It found that even if future warming was limited to just a few tenths of a degree more, it would have "limited power to prevent ocean warming that could lead to the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet."</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated image provided by British Antarctic Survey, shows the North Cove, in Antarctic. (Michael Shortt/British Antarctic Survey via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/b89651bb-aab0-4e18-8706-f5c8bfa0a0ce_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/>

<p>Many scientists say the goal of just a few tenths of a degree of warming is unlikely to be met.</p>
<p>"Our main question here was: How much control do we still have over ice <strong>shelf</strong> melting? How much melting can still be prevented by reducing emissions?" said study lead writer Kaitlin Naughten. She is an expert on oceans at the British Antarctic Survey.</p>
<p>She said their research suggests that Earth is set on the path to a quick increase in the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting over the rest of the century.</p>
<p>While past studies have talked about how serious the situation is, Naughten was the first to use computer modeling to study how warm water from below will melt the ice.</p>
<p>The study looked at four different cases in how much carbon emissions the world produces. In each case, ocean warming was just too much for this area of the ice to survive, the study found.</p>
<p>Naughten looked at melting, floating areas of ice that hold back <strong>glaciers</strong>. Once these areas of ice melt, there is nothing to stop the glaciers behind them from flowing into the sea.</p>
<p>The study also looked at what would happen if future warming was limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius over mid-19th century levels: the international goal. They found the <strong>runaway</strong> melting process in this case as well.</p>
<p>The world has already warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times and much of this summer went past the 1.5 degrees mark.</p>
<p>Naughten's study looked at the part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that is most at risk from melting from below, near the Amundsen Sea. It includes the very large Thwaites ice shelf that is melting so fast it is called "the Doomsday Glacier."</p>
<p>That part of Antarctica "is <strong>doomed</strong>," said University of California Irvine ice scientist ice scientist Eric Rignot. He was not part of the study. He added, "The damage has already been done."</p>
<p>Naughten does not like to use the word "doomed," because she said 100 years from now, the world might not just stop but drive back carbon levels in the air and climate change. But she said what is happening now on the ground is a slow collapse that cannot be stopped, at least not in this century.</p>

<p>The Pakistani government has approved the creation of several <strong>deportation</strong> centers for hundreds of thousands of Afghans living illegally in the country. Pakistan plans to arrest and send the Afghan nationals back to Afghanistan starting next month.</p>
<p>The government recently approved the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan. It sets a November 1 <strong>deadline</strong>. The deadline is for all "illegal/unregistered foreigners" and those overstaying their visas. These groups are required to return to their countries. If they do not, they face deportation for breaking Pakistan's immigration laws.</p>
<p>Pakistani Interior Minister Sarfaraz spoke when the deadline was announced in early October. He said an estimated 1.7 million Afghans are among those facing deportation.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Afghan refugees board a bus from Karachi, Pakistan, to Afghanistan on Sept. 21, 2023.

<p>Official <strong>sources</strong> told VOA that special deportation centers would be established in four areas: Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>
<p>Afghans detained in Punjab and Sindh will be moved to centers in the Rawalpindi and Karachi areas.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will have two deportation centers in Nowshehra and Chamkani. While Baluchistan will have three centers: one in the capital of Quetta, and others in the areas of Pishin and Qilla Abdullah districts. These two areas are on Pakistan's 2,600-kilometer border with Afghanistan. Most refugee families are in those areas.</p>
<p>The new plan <strong>empowers</strong> local administrations, police, and other officials to detain and deport Afghan nationals illegally living in the country. The plan also says that individuals charged with or on trial for minor crimes will be sent out of the country. It also says that those charged with or facing trial for "serious crimes" will not be sent back to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has promised to carry out the deportations in "a <strong>phased </strong>and orderly" way. It also said that it would not target the 1.4 million Afghan refugees living legally in the country. The government added it would not target 900,000 Afghan citizens who are registered in Pakistan as economic migrants.</p>
<p>The government has told law enforcement agencies not to <strong>harass</strong> legal refugees and those with Afghan nationality documents. However, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and refugee families have claimed that some Afghans experienced abuse and mistreatment from the police.</p>
<p>The Taliban have called on Pakistan to reconsider the deportation plan, calling it "<strong>inhumane</strong>" and "unacceptable." However, they have recently set up special camps on the Afghan side of the border. The camps will provide immediate shelter, health care, food, and financial assistance to families returning from the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Officials in both countries have confirmed that tens of thousands of Afghans have voluntarily returned to their home country since Pakistan announced the deadline nearly a month ago.</p>
<p>Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Afghan television urged Pakistan to treat Afghan refugees "humanely" and extend the period of deportation. He asked all the refugees to return to their country. He said the Taliban has made Afghanistan into a "safer and better" place.</p>
<p><strong>Taliban rule in Afghanistan </strong></p>
<p>The Taliban seized power from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021. At that time, U.S. and NATO troops left the country after nearly 20 years of involvement in the Afghan war.</p>
<p>After the Taliban took over, hundreds of thousands of people fled to Pakistan. They feared punishment for their connections to Western forces. They included human rights defenders, former government officials, professionals, female activists and reporters.</p>
<p>Many have since moved to the U.S. and other Western countries. But thousands are waiting in hopes of immigrating to the United States or Europe.</p>
<p>The Taliban has enforced Islamic law in the country. The group has barred <strong>teenage </strong>girls from schools and many women from work. The restrictions mean many refugee families do not want to return to Afghanistan. They say their daughters cannot seek education or work in the country.</p>
<p>The United Nations has urged Pakistan to suspend its deportation plan. It warns the plan could mean Afghans will be subject to abuse by the country's ruling Taliban officials.</p>

            <title>Publishers Worry Over Google’s New AI Search Tool   (2023/10/25)</title>

<span class="datetime">24 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Publishing companies are growing increasingly concerned about <strong>generative AI</strong>, especially a <strong>model</strong> developed by Google.</p>
<p>Since May, Google has begun releasing a new form of search in the United States, India, and Japan powered by generative AI. The product is called Search Generative Experience, or SGE. SGE uses AI to create <strong>summaries </strong>for some search questions. Google says those summaries appear on the top of the Google search homepage, with links to "dig deeper."</p>
<p>If publishers want to prevent their content from being used by Google's AI to create those summaries, they must use the same tool that would prevent them from appearing in Google search results. That would make it difficult for people using search to find the publishers that choose not to be involved in SGE.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman passes the logo from the web search engine provider Google during the digital society festival 're:publica', at the Arena Berlin in Berlin, Germany June 9, 2022.

<p>Google says that the AI-generated summaries are put together from many web pages and that the links are designed to be a starting point to learn more. The company describes SGE as an <strong>opt-in</strong> experiment for users, who will help develop and improve the product.</p>
<p>To publishers, however, the new search tool is the latest concern in an unusual relationship. Publishers both compete against Google for online advertising and depend on the company for search traffic.</p>
<p>Four major publishers spoke to Reuters news agency recently. The businesses said they are trying to understand their place in a world where AI could control how users find and pay for information. The publishers asked not to be identified because of ongoing negotiations with Google.</p>
<p>Publisher concerns relate to a number of issues. They include the issue of web traffic; whether publishers will be credited as the providers of information that appears in the SGE summaries; and whether those summaries are correct. Most importantly, publishers want to be paid for the <strong>content</strong> on which Google and other AI companies train their AI tools.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said in a statement: "As we bring generative AI into Search, we're continuing to <strong>prioritize </strong>approaches that send valuable traffic to a wide range of creators, including news publishers, to support a healthy, open web."</p>
<p>On the issue of payments, Google said it is developing a better understanding of the business of generative AI<strong> applications</strong> and getting opinions from publishers and others.</p>
<p>In late September, Google announced a new tool called Google-Extended. It gives publishers the choice to block their content from being used by Google to train its AI models.</p>
<p>Giving publishers the choice to not be used for AI is a "good faith<strong> gesture</strong>," said Danielle Coffey, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, an industry trade group. "Whether payments will follow is a question mark, and to what extent there is openness to having a healthier value exchange," Coffey added.</p>
<p>The new tool does not permit publishers to block their content from being used for SGE without disappearing from traditional Google search.</p>
<p>Publishers want evidence that people are using their websites to secure advertisers. Showing up in Google search is important to their business. The design for SGE has pushed the links that appear in traditional search further down the webpage. That might reduce traffic to those links by as much as 40 percent, said an official at one of the publishers.</p>
<p>More worrying is the possibility that people searching the web will avoid <strong>clicking </strong>any of the links if the SGE passage meets the users' need for information.</p>
<p>Nikhil Lai is an expert with Forrester Research, a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He said SGE is "definitely going to decrease publishers'...traffic and they're going to have to think about a different way to measure the value of that content, if not click through rate."</p>
<p>Even so, he believes publishers will remain trusted because their links will appear in SGE.</p>

            <title>More US States Teach Financial Education in High School  (2023/10/25) | 越来越多美国州要求高中进行理财教育</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>An increasing number of American states are requiring that students receive personal finance education in order to complete high school. At the same time, states are hoping to improve math skills among students in the United States.<br/>
美国越来越多州要求学生接受个人理财教育才能完成高中学业。与此同时，各州希望提高美国学生的数学技能。</p>
<p>Capital City Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. has a course called Advanced Algebra with Financial Applications. The school has offered the math class for more than 10 years. The class provides students with basic knowledge about money management and helps them sharpen their math skills. Classes discuss credit, investments, and loans, for example, and connect these ideas with methods of math for calculating interest, budgeting and more.<br/>
华盛顿特区首都公立特许学校开设了一门名为“高级代数与金融应用”的课程。这所学校开设这门数学课程已有10多年了。该课程为学生提供有关资金管理的基本知识，并帮助他们提高数学技能。例如，课程讨论信贷、投资和贷款，并将这些想法与计算利息、预算等的数学方法联系起来。</p>
<p>The high school may be a leader in providing financial education, but in recent years, many others have offered similar courses.<br/>
这所高中可能是提供金融教育的领导者，但近年来，许多其他学校也开设了类似的课程。</p>
<p>Since 2020, nine U.S. states have passed laws or policies requiring schools to provide personal finance education before students can graduate from high school. The U.S. non-profit organization, Council for Economic Education, says 30 states now have such policies in place.<br/>
自2020年以来，美国九个州通过了法律或政策，要求学校在学生高中毕业前提供个人理财教育。美国非营利组织经济教育委员会表示，目前已有30个州制定了此类政策。</p>
<p>The increase comes as educators are trying to improve students' math skills, which dropped during the pandemic and have not fully recovered. At the same time, a general dislike or disinterest for math remains a barrier among young people.<br/>
这一增长正值教育工作者试图提高学生的数学技能之际，数学技能在疫情期间有所下降并且尚未完全恢复。与此同时，对数学的普遍厌恶或不感兴趣仍然是年轻人的一个障碍。</p>
<p>Tonica Tatum-Gormes teaches the course at the Washington school. She said students get more interested in math when they see how it connects with their future financial well-being.<br/>
托尼卡·泰特姆-戈麦斯这所华盛顿学校教授这门课程。她说，当学生们看到数学与他们未来的经济状况之间的联系时，他们会对数学更感兴趣。</p>
<p>Students begin to understand that "‘yes, I need to learn decimals, and I need to learn fractions, and I need to learn percentages because I have to manage my money and I have to take out a loan,'" Tatum-Gormes said.<br/>
泰特姆-戈麦斯说：“学生们开始明白，‘是的，我需要学习小数，我需要学会分数，我需要学百分比，因为我必须管理我的资金，我必须取得贷款。’”</p>
<p>Supporters say personal finance courses help students learn how to make smart money decisions and develop an interest in math as a result.<br/>
支持者表示，个人理财课程有助于学生学习如何做出明智的理财决策，并因此培养对数学的兴趣。</p>
<p>The Council for Economic Education says financial education should include exploring subjects like earning, budgeting, saving, investing, and managing credit and financial risk. Experts say the class does not have to be taught by a traditional math teacher.<br/>
经济教育委员会表示，金融教育应包括探索诸如收入、预算、储蓄、投资以及信贷和金融风险管理等科目。专家表示，这门课不必由传统数学老师来教。</p>
<p>Idaho is one of the states where a new financial literacy requirement is in place.<br/>
爱达荷州是实施新的金融知识要求的州之一。</p>
<p>The new program will give students the chance to use skills from their algebra, calculus, and economics classes in real life. In the class, they will calculate their future student loans, rent payments, and income requirements.<br/>
新课程将让学生有机会在现实生活中运用代数、微积分和经济学课程中的技能。在课堂上，他们将计算未来的学生贷款、租金和收入要求。</p>
<p>Experts say the 2007-2008 financial crisis, pandemic-linked economic insecurity and current high inflation may have increased Americans' desire for stronger financial knowledge. Less than one-fourth of millennials show basic financial literacy, the Council for Economic Education says.<br/>
专家表示，2007-2008年的金融危机、与疫情相关的经济不安全以及当前的高通胀可能增加了美国人对更强大金融知识的渴望。经济教育委员会表示，只有不到四分之一的千禧一代具备基本的金融知识。</p>
<p>In 2020, the American civil rights group, NAACP, released a resolution calling for more financial literacy programs in K-12 schools.<br/>
2020年，美国民权组织全国有色人种协进会发布了一项决议，呼吁在K-12学校开展更多的金融扫盲课程。</p>
<p>A study by the non-profit Next Gen Personal Finance Schools looked at states without high school financial literacy requirements. It found that in schools with mainly Black and Hispanic student populations, only seven percent of students have access to a half-school year personal finance course. That figure rises to 14.2 percent for schools with less than a quarter of students identifying as Black or Hispanic.<br/>
非营利组织“下一代个人金融学校”的一项研究考察了没有高中金融素养要求的州。研究发现，在以黑人和西班牙裔学生为主的学校，只有7%的学生能够上半学年的个人理财课程。对于黑人或西班牙裔学生不到四分之一的学校，这一数字上升到14.2%。</p>
<p>That lack of fairness is a driving force behind the financial literacy course at Capital City Public Charter School. It serves a student population that is 64 percent Latino and 25 percent Black.<br/>
这种缺乏公平是首都公立特许学校金融素养课程背后的驱动力。它为拉丁裔占64%和黑人占25%的学生群体提供服务。</p>
<p>"It's an empowering course," says Laina Cox, head of the school. "I think it gives our young people the language that they need and the voice when they're in certain rooms and at certain tables."<br/>
该校校长莱娜·考克斯表示：“这是一门充满力量的课程。我认为，当我们的年轻人在某些场合时，它给了他们所需要的语言和声音。”</p>

            <title>Why the Interest Rate of US Treasury Notes Matters  (2023/10/25)</title>

<p>The U.S. government needs money to operate.</p>
<p>A lot of that money comes from taxes. However, much of the money the U.S. government uses to pay its costs comes from borrowing in the form of U.S. Treasury securities.</p>
<p>Investors, who believe the U.S. government will be able to pay them back, agree to loan the government money for a period of time. They receive interest payments regularly or in a way set by the Treasury.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a meeting of the Economic Club of New York, Oct. 19, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, file)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/ab6003e3-0af3-4943-aefe-b4e1290c264c_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/>

<p>The difference between the loan amount and the investment return is called the yield.</p>
<p>In past years, the interest rate on the U.S. government 10-year note was low. For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, the interest rate for a 10-year government debt security was less than one percent. If you loaned the U.S. government $100, you would receive about one dollar a year in interest until the note "matures," or is paid back.</p>
<p>Now, however, the yield has jumped to about five percent for a 10-year note. A note is a debt security with a term of between two and 10 years. That means investors who agree to lend money to the U.S. government for a period of 10 years will earn about a five percent return each year.</p>
<p>That sounds good for investors. But everyone is not happy about it.</p>
<p>The reason is that many other interest rates are tied to the U.S. rate for the 10-year note.</p>
<p>In a recent report, the Associated Press called the 10-year note "the <strong>centerpiece</strong> of the global financial system."</p>
<p>Many mortgage rates, the interest rates people pay for their home loans, are connected to the 10-year note. As a result, borrowing money becomes more costly. Over the life of a 30-year home mortgage agreement, a homeowner could pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more in interest than just two or three years ago.</p>
<p>In addition, the high rates on the 10-year note make it harder for some new businesses to grow. A young business often does not make money. But if it wants to hire new people or create a new product, it will often take out a loan from a bank or agree to pay investors interest. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the cost of these loans has mainly been very low – only a little higher than zero percent interest.</p>
<p>The low rates permitted many companies to borrow money at a low cost. Many of the world's economies that were struggling recovered because of the low rates. Individual investors bought stocks because they did not see a large cost to borrow money. They did not see U.S. Treasury securities as a good investment because their interest rates were so low.</p>
<p>But now, interest rates are rising. As a result, some businesses are choosing not to expand. Some are even reducing their workforce in order to reduce operating costs.</p>
<p><strong>Why did the interest rates rise so fast?</strong></p>
<p>The cost of living increased quickly once many countries re-opened after the pandemic. Cars, food and energy prices all went higher. The war in Ukraine reduced the food and energy supply in Europe and Africa, so those costs increased for Europeans and Africans.</p>
<p>Many people found that the usual amount of money did not buy the usual amount of goods. That is called inflation. In some countries, the price of food and energy doubled in a short time. Home prices increased because many people decided they needed more space if they were going to do their jobs from home.</p>
<p>The fast inflation concerned government banks around the world. In countries such as the U.S. and areas like Europe, central banks decided to raise the interest rates they control as a way to reduce, or slow, inflation.</p>
<p>Central bankers believe that increasing interest rates can keep people and businesses from spending too much money. To a point, the plan has worked. In the U.S., some data shows inflation is slowing.</p>
<p>Economists who study the U.S. have been surprised that the economy stayed strong even as interest rates for Treasury securities have increased. People are still spending money and the employment rate is high.</p>
<p>But some investors are thinking that a yield of about 5 percent is better than putting money into stocks that might lose value. As a result, stocks prices have dropped since the summer.</p>
<p>Because U.S. Treasury securities are not a high-risk investment, the U.S. dollar has gotten stronger compared to the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>High interest rates also hurt some investors who decided to put their money in safe U.S. Treasury securities five or 10 years ago. If those investors purchased bonds paying a lower interest rate than today, they would lose money if they tried to sell those securities on the open market now.</p>
<p>One large investment <strong>fund</strong> that purchases U.S. debt securities with different terms has lost three percent of its value this year. If this situation continues, the fund is <strong>on track</strong> to lose value for the third year <strong>in a row</strong>.</p>

            <title>Women in Iceland, Including PM, Strike for Equal Pay  (2023/10/25)</title>

<p>Iceland's prime minister and women across the island nation went on strike Tuesday. They are pushing for an end to unequal pay and <strong>gender</strong>-based violence.</p>
<p>Icelanders awoke to all-male news teams announcing shutdowns across the nation. Schools closed down, public transportation was delayed, hospitals had fewer workers, and hotel rooms went uncleaned.</p>
<p>Katrin Jakobsdóttir is Iceland's prime minister. She said that she would stay home as part of the women's strike and expected other women on her cabinet to do the same.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="People across Iceland gather during the women's strike in Reykjavik, Iceland, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Arni Torfason)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-7ee5-08dbd4b469a2_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">

<p>Iceland's trade <strong>unions</strong> are the main organizers of the strike. They called on women and <strong>nonbinary</strong>, a term to describe those who do not identify as male or female, to strike. They refused to do both paid and unpaid work, including household work, for the day. About 90 percent of Icelandic workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>Schools and the health system, which have large female workforces, said they would be heavily affected by the walkout. National broadcaster RUV said it was reducing television and radio broadcasts for the day.</p>
<p>Tuesday's walkout lasts from midnight to midnight. It is called the biggest strike since Iceland's first such event on October 24, 1975. That was when 90 percent of women refused to work, clean or look after children, to express anger at discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>In 1976, Iceland passed a law guaranteeing equal rights of men and women. Since then, there have been several partial-day strikes. The most recent one came in 2018, with women walking off the job in the early afternoon. That represented the time of day when women, on average, stop earning compared to men.</p>
<p>Iceland is a country of about 380,000 people. It sits just below the Arctic Circle in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has been ranked as the world's most gender-equal country 14 years straight by the World Economic Forum, which measures pay, education, health care among others. No country has reached full equality, and there remains a gender pay <strong>gap</strong> in Iceland.</p>
<p>"We have not yet reached our goals of full gender equality and we are still <strong>tackling</strong> the gender-based wage gap, which is unacceptable in 2023," the prime minster said.</p>
<p>The cabinet is evenly split between male and female ministers. Nearly half of lawmakers in Iceland's parliament are women.</p>
<p>Many women in Iceland are in high paying and powerful positions. But the lowest paying jobs, such as cleaning and child care, are still mostly done by women.</p>
<p>The work is very important for Iceland's <strong>tourism</strong> economy. It also depends heavily on immigrants, who largely work longer hours and take home the lowest pay. Around 22 percent of the female workforce is foreign born, found Statistics Iceland.</p>
<p>Large parts of the center of the capital, Reykjavík, will be closed to traffic ahead of a protest on Tuesday afternoon. Protest signs, posted on social media before the event, hit back at the idea that Iceland is already perfect for women with the <strong>slogan</strong>, "You call this gender equality?"</p>
<p>Iceland's 1975 strike led to similar protests in other countries including Poland. There, women boycotted jobs and classes in 2016 to protest a proposed abortion ban.</p>
<p>In Spain, women struck for 24 hours in 2018. The country's major unions estimated that 5.3 million people joined the strike.</p>
<p>Spain's Equality Minister Irene Montero said Tuesday that the 2018 strike was <strong>inspired</strong> by Iceland's 1975 walkout. She expressed full support for the latest protest.</p>

            <title>Scientists Propose ‘Law of Nature’ Expanding on Evolution  (2023/10/24)</title>

<p>British naturalist Charles Darwin presented his theory of <strong>evolution</strong> in the 1859 book <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. He proposed that biological species change over time by gaining <strong>traits</strong> that help them survive and reproduce.</p>
<p>Now 164 years later, nine scientists and philosophers propose a new "law of nature" that includes the biological evolution described by Darwin. They say Darwin's theory is a striking example of a much larger happening that appears at the level of atoms, minerals, planetary atmospheres, planets, stars and more.</p>
<p>"We see evolution as a universal process that <strong>applies</strong> to numerous systems, both living and nonliving, that increase in <strong>diversity</strong> and <strong>patterning</strong> through time," said Robert Hazen. He is a mineralogist and astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science based in Washington, D.C. Hazen is a co-writer of the scientific paper describing the new law in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2310223120" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pigeon bones are displayed in Charles Darwin's former home Down House, Kent, southern England February 12, 2009.

(REUTERS/Tal Cohen)</span></div>
<p>The scientists propose a rule called "the law of increasing functional information." It holds that evolving systems, biological or non-biological, always form from several interacting building blocks like atoms or cells. The process, they say, creates many different combinations. Evolution happens when these combinations are subject to selection for useful functions, or purposes.</p>
<p>"We have well-documented laws that describe such everyday <strong>phenomena</strong> as forces, motions, gravity, electricity and magnetism and energy," Hazen said. "But these laws do not, individually or collectively, describe or explain why the universe keeps getting more diverse and complex at scales of atoms, molecules, minerals and more."</p>
<p>For example, scientists say just two elements, hydrogen and helium, made up the first generation of stars following the Big Bang at the beginning of our universe about 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>That first generation of stars created about 20 heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in their centers, or cores. These elements exploded into space at the end of the stars' life cycles. The following generation of stars that formed from parts of the first generation then similarly created almost 100 more elements.</p>
<p>But Hazen said only a small number of all possible combinations would "work." They have some useful level of function. So, nature just prefers them, he said.</p>
<p>Hazen added that "function" might mean that a collection of atoms makes a stable mineral <strong>crystal</strong> that can survive, or that a star keeps its active structure, or that "a life form learns a new 'trick' that <strong>allows</strong> it to compete better than its neighbors," Hazen added.</p>
<p>The writers proposed three universal ideas about selection: the basic ability to last; the lasting nature of active processes that may enable evolution; and the development of new qualities as an <strong>adaptation</strong> to an environment.</p>
<p>The scientists said some biological examples include organisms developing the ability to swim, walk, fly and think. Humans developed after their ancestors evolved from chimpanzees and gained traits including upright walking and increased brain size.</p>
<p>Michael Wong is the paper's lead writer and an astrobiologist and planetary scientist at the Carnegie Institution. He said, "I think this paper is important because it describes a view of the <strong>cosmos</strong> rooted in function."</p>
<p>Jonathan Lunine is chair of Cornell University's astronomy department. He is another of the paper's writers. He said the new law explains "why the diverse systems that make up the cosmos evolve the way they do."</p>

            <title>New Controller Aims to Make Gaming Easier for People with Disabilities  (2023/10/24)</title>

<p>Paul Lane uses his mouth and face to push buttons and guide his virtual car on <em>Gran Turismo</em>,<em> </em>a game on the PlayStation 5. It is how he has been playing for the past 23 years, after a car accident left him unable to use his fingers.</p>
<p>Playing video games has long been difficult for people with disabilities. The controllers for the PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo can be very hard, or even impossible, to use for people with limited mobility.</p>
<p>As part of the gaming industry's efforts to fix the problem, Sony has worked with Lane and others to develop the new Access controller for PlayStation. Other companies, including Microsoft, and even people with <strong>3-D</strong> printers have also created their own <strong>accessible</strong> controllers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Paul Amadeus Lane uses a Sony Access controller to play a PlayStation 5 video game at Sony Interactive Entertainment headquarters Thursday, Sept. 28, 2023, in San Mateo, Calif.

<p>"I was big into sports before my injury," said Cesar Flores. The 30-year-old has used a wheelchair since a car accident eight years ago. He also worked with Sony on the controller. "And when I play video games, it reminds me that I'm still human. It reminds me that I'm still one of the guys."</p>
<p>Putting the traditional controller aside, Lane, 52, switches to the Access. It is round and <strong>customizable</strong> and can rest on a table or wheelchair <strong>tray.</strong> It can be customized in many ways, depending on what the user needs. That includes switching buttons and thumbsticks, programming special controls and combining two controllers to be used as one. As Lane plays <em>Gran Turismo</em>, he uses the back of his hand on the controller.</p>
<p>Lane and other gamers have been working with Sony since 2018 to help design the Access controller. The idea was to create something that could work for many people with different needs, rather than centering on any particular disability.</p>
<p>Mark Barlet is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit AbleGamers. He said his organization has been supporting gamers with disabilities for nearly 20 years. AbleGamers also helped both Sony and Microsoft with their controllers.</p>
<p>"The last five years I have seen the game accessibility movement go from (independent) <strong>studios</strong> working on some features to triple-A games being able to be played by people who identify as blind," he said. "In five years, it's been <strong>breathtaking</strong>."</p>
<p>PlayStation's Access controller will go on sale worldwide on December 6 and cost $90 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Alvin Daniel of PlayStation said the device was designed with three ideas in mind to make it usable for as many players as possible.</p>
<p>First, the player does not have to hold the controller to use it. It can lay flat on a table or wheelchair tray, for example. It was important for it to fit on a wheelchair tray, since once something falls off the tray, it might be impossible for the player to pick it up without help. It also had to be <strong>durable</strong> for this same reason.</p>
<p>Second, it is much easier to press the buttons than on the common controller. It comes with buttons in different sizes and shapes so people can experiment with shaping it the way it works best for them. The third is the thumbsticks, which can also be changed depending on what works for the person using it.</p>
<p>After his accident, Lane stopped gaming for seven years. For someone who began playing video games as a young child, "it was a <strong>void</strong>" in his life, he said.</p>
<p>"Having gaming and having an <strong>opportunity</strong> to game at a very high level, to be able to do it again, it is like a reunion, (like losing) a close <strong>companion</strong> and being able to reunite with that person again."</p>

            <title>Uganda’s President Aims to Ban Used Clothing from the West  (2023/10/24)</title>

<p>People, rich and poor, crowd into Owino Market. Owino is a huge open market in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. People here are mostly looking for secondhand clothing, clothes that have been worn by someone else. The clothes are usually low-cost but still are well made.</p>
<p>Such clothes usually come from Europeans and Americans who no longer want or need them. Businesses purchase the used clothing, and other businesses export them to sell in Africa. The business is valued at millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Some people say the demand for such clothes demonstrates that Africans believe Western <strong>fashion</strong> is better than clothes made in Africa.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ugandans buy used clothes at Owino Market, in Kampala, Uganda, Sept. 15, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d66d-08dbcf655942_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ugandans buy used clothes at Owino Market, in Kampala, Uganda, Sept. 15, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)</span></div>
<p>In 2017, the U.S. Agency for International Development aimed to find out about the clothes East Africans buy. Its study found that about two-thirds of people in seven East African countries have "purchased at least a <strong>portion</strong> of their clothes from the secondhand clothing market."</p>
<p>Although they are popular, secondhand clothes are facing increasing resistance. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has held power in Uganda since 1986. He declared in August that he was banning imports of used clothing. He said the clothes are "from dead people."</p>
<p>"When a white person dies, they gather their clothes and send them to Africa," Museveni said.</p>
<p>Trade officials have not yet enforced the president's declaration, which requires a legal measure, such as an executive order.</p>
<p>Other African governments are trying to stop used clothing imports, saying the business is like sending waste to Africa and harms local cloth industries.</p>
<p>The East African Community trade bloc includes Burundi, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. It has advised banning imports of secondhand clothing since 2016. However, member states have not put bans into effect.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the president's statement has spread concern among traders. A ban would put them out of business. Traders sell used clothes across the country of 45 million people. They do business in large open-air markets, roadside stands and even in stores in <strong>malls</strong>.</p>
<p>A group of traders in Kampala, known as KACITA, opposes a ban on secondhand clothing. The group suggests slowly reducing the imports so that local clothing producers can develop the ability to meet demand.</p>
<p>Some Ugandan clothing makers, like Winfred Arinaitwe, admit that the quality of locally made cloth is often poor. Many people choose to buy used clothing, she said.</p>
<p>"Because it lasts longer," she said, "it can easily be seen."</p>
<p>In Owino Market, a ban on used clothes is unbelievable to many. Some say they do not believe the president's threat.</p>
<p>Abdulrashid Ssuuna's job is to get people in the market to visit his brother's used clothing business. He said a ban would deny him a way to make a living.</p>
<p>"It's like they want to chase us out of the country," he said of the president's order. He said he cannot <strong>afford</strong> to sell new clothes.</p>
<p>The market is competitive, with sellers sitting behind <strong>heaps</strong> of clothes and shouting words of welcome to possible buyers.</p>
<p>If he helps his brother sell clothing, "I get something," said Ssuuna, who started this work after dropping out of high school in 2020.</p>
<p>The market is always full of buyers, but business is unpredictable. Traders must try to imagine what people want before other sellers do.</p>
<p>Tadeo Walusimbi has been a used clothing trader for six years. He said some days are better than others, but he warned a government ban would not be supported.</p>
<p>It "will not work for me and for so many people," Walusimbi said.</p>

            <title>Researchers Build First AI Tool to Discover Supernovas  (2023/10/23)</title>

<p>Scientists say they have built an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can successfully identify and confirm supernovas.</p>
<p>A supernova is an "extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star," the American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/">reports</a>. The explosion takes place at the end of a star's life.</p>
<p>The current process for discovering supernovas usually involves both machines and people. Telescopes repeatedly collect images of the night sky and compare these images to identify differences in observed objects. These differences can suggest the presence of supernovas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A deep-space image shows the galaxy where the supernova happened. (Image Credit: Legacy Surveys/D. Lang (Perimeter Institute/NASA/JPL-Caltech) " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-31f9-08dbd0f759df_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A deep-space image shows the galaxy where the supernova happened. (Image Credit: Legacy Surveys/D. Lang (Perimeter Institute/NASA/JPL-Caltech) </span></div>
<p>Robotic telescopes can present a list of possible supernovas to human scientists. This data is then examined by human scientists whose job it is to identify and confirm supernova candidates. Now, for the first time, researchers say they have successfully used an AI tool to complete all steps in this process.</p>
<p>An international team of scientists developed the AI-based system. Researchers from Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois led the team. The team's chief was Adam Miller, an assistant professor of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern.</p>
<p>Miller <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/10/first-supernova-detected-confirmed-classified-and-shared-by-ai/">said</a> his team recently informed the international astronomical community of its success with the new AI system. The tool is called the Bright Transient Survey Bot, or BTSbot.</p>
<p>The robot was used to find, identify and <strong>classify</strong> a supernova for the first time, Miller said. He noted that researchers had spent more than 2,000 hours over the past six years looking at telescope data in order to find and classify supernova candidates.</p>
<p>"For the first time ever, a series of robots and AI algorithms has observed, then identified, then communicated with another telescope to finally confirm the discovery of a supernova," Miller said.</p>
<p>The researchers say the new system can take over much of the work humans now do looking for and classifying supernovas. This can free up scientists to do more in-depth examinations of the supernovas themselves and the reasons they were created.</p>
<p>In order to confirm a supernova, scientists have to examine its spectrum. The spectrum represents the object's <strong>dispersed</strong> light, which shows elements that were present during the explosion of a supernova.</p>
<p>The study of supernovas has high scientific value because it can help astronomers learn more about the universe and how it began. For example, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/">says</a> scientists have learned a lot about the behaviors and chemical processes of stars from supernovas.</p>
<p>Miller said the new tool can help researchers "<strong>analyze</strong> their observations and develop new <strong>hypotheses</strong>" to explain why the supernova explosions happened.</p>
<p>Nabeel Rehemtulla co-led the research and development of the BTSbot. He said the tool greatly "streamlines large studies of supernovas." This helps scientists better understand the life cycles of stars and helps to identify elements supernovas create, such as carbon, iron and gold, Rehemtulla noted.</p>
<p>The research team said testing of the BTSbot involved looking at a newly discovered supernova candidate called SN2023tyk. The AI tool identified the supernova on October 5.</p>
<p>After the identification, the BTSbot requested additional data on its own from the California-based Palomar Observatory. Then, another telescope, known as the SED Machine, performed its own "in-depth observations" to get information on the object's spectrum.</p>
<p>The SED Machine then sent the spectrum data to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Caltech uses an AI <strong>algorithm</strong> to classify the kind of supernova. This can either be a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf or the collapse of a star's center, or core.</p>
<p>The algorithm classified the supernova a Type 1a, a kind of star explosion in which a white dwarf in a star system fully explodes.</p>
<p>Rehemtulla said the success of the BTSbot will ease supernova identifications, while freeing up human scientists to do more detailed study of the newly discovered objects.</p>
<p>"The beauty of it is that, once everything is turned on and working properly, we don't actually do anything," Rehemtulla noted. "We go to sleep at night, and, in the morning, we see that BTSbot, and these other AIs, <strong>unwaveringly</strong> do their jobs."</p>

<p>Antarctic krill, a relative of shrimp and crabs, are only a few centimeters in size. But scientists say they are important to the area's <strong>food web</strong>, including food for some of the Earth's largest animals, whales.</p>
<p>Fishing ships in the Antarctic gather krill for use as food in an increasing number of products. That has activists concerned.</p>
<p>Alistair Allan is an activist with the Bob Brown Foundation, an Australian environmental group with ties to the country's Green Party. Allan said he was worried the ship activity could harm the whales: "You have the ships almost running into whales feeding on the same things they're fishing."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by the British Antarctic Survey shows an Antarctic krill (Euphausia suberba). (Chris Gilbert/British Antarctic Survey)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9a99-08dbcf5f10d0_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This photo provided by the British Antarctic Survey shows an Antarctic krill (Euphausia suberba). (Chris Gilbert/British Antarctic Survey)</span></div>
<p>Krill fishing is banned in U.S. waters because of concerns it could affect whales, seals and other sea animals. But krill fishing has gone on for about 60 years. It is believed to have started when the former Soviet Union sent an industrial fleet to the Antarctic in search of a supply of high-protein food.</p>
<p>Demand has increased over the years. Krill is used a lot in the fish farming industry. They are also used in nutritional supplements, pet food and other high-protein foods.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that 10 to 12 ships, mainly from Norway and China, head to the South Orkney Islands, to fish for krill each December. Fishing countries agreed to a catch limit under a <strong>conservation</strong> agreement. In 2022, that level was about 416,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>A coalition of countries led by the U.S. has called for additional restrictions. The coalition says krill is important to other animals. It also says that krill removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. However, China and Russia have opposed efforts to put in place new restrictions.</p>
<p>There are reports that the krill boats are a danger to whales. In addition to that, a study from the University of California, Santa Cruz found that pregnancy rates among humpback whales in Antarctica have fallen sharply. The reason, it said, might be a lack of krill.</p>
<p>Also, research published by the World Wildlife Fund, a Swiss conservation group, says that krill remove 23 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The research suggests that krill do this by eating phytoplankton, microscopic forms of life that make food from sunlight and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Emma Cavan is a biologist at Imperial College London. She helped write the report. She said: "Antarctic krill are worth more to nature and people left in the ocean..."</p>
<p><strong>More rules for krill harvesting</strong></p>
<p>The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, is an international body with 27 member states established in 1982. The group, based in Tasmania, Australia, makes rules for conservation issues like krill fishing.</p>
<p>But some supporters of the group say it has to consider climate change in its rules.</p>
<p>Clair Christian is head of the Antarctic and South Ocean Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C. Her group represents environmental groups at CCAMLR meetings. Christian told the AP that CCAMLR is supposed to support conservation, "It's not to enable fishing," she said.</p>
<p>The Australia-based Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies (ARK) represents members who harvest 90 percent of the Antarctic krill. Members accepted <strong>self-imposed</strong> restrictions in 2018.</p>
<p>The group has agreed to place stronger rules on moving krill between ships and to study the effects of climate change on krill.</p>
<p>But the group says its catch limits should be higher. It noted that its members catch less than one percent of the estimated 60 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds. That leaves 99 percent for whales and other animals.</p>
<p>Activists, however, are calling for reform. Helena Herr studies whales at the University of Hamburg, in Germany. Herr briefly served in an advisory position with the ARK group. She believes krill fishing should be banned. She said she did not trust the estimates of the amount of krill in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>"The data is based on such <strong>vague assumptions</strong> that we don't really know what we're doing," she said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chinese EV makers and Europe<br/>
中国电动汽车制造商与欧洲</span></p>
<p>Chinese EV makers like Europe because auto import taxes are just 10 percent compared to 27.5 percent in the United States, automotive expert Matthias Schmidt said. Europe also has the world's second-biggest EV battery market after China.<br/>
汽车专家马蒂亚斯·施密特表示，中国电动汽车制造商喜欢欧洲，因为其汽车进口税仅为10%，而美国为27.5%。欧洲也是仅次于中国的全球第二大电动汽车电池市场。</p>
<p>Car buyers in Europe like how Chinese EVs are not costly yet filled with features and stylish designs. Concerns about the threat to local carmakers and jobs are just not as important for some European buyers who face increased living costs.<br/>
欧洲的购车者喜欢中国电动汽车价格不高，但充满了各种功能和时尚设计。对于一些面临生活成本增加的欧洲买家来说，对当地汽车制造商和就业威胁的担忧没那么重要。</p>
<p>British retiree John Kirkwood replaced his Volkswagen Passat three years ago with an MG5 station wagon. The MG5's price was much lower than the price of the nearest competitor — a Kia that cost thousands more.<br/>
英国退休人员约翰·柯克伍德三年前用一辆名爵5旅行车取代了他的大众帕萨特。名爵5的价格远低于最接近的竞争对手起亚的价格，后者的价格高出数千美元。</p>
<p>"It's nice. It's quiet, it's refined" and very quick, Kirkwood said, adding that he had few concerns about the Chinese ownership of the British brand.<br/>
柯克伍德说：“它很好。它很安静，很精致”，而且提速很快。他补充说，他对中国拥有这家英国品牌的所有权并不担心。</p>
<p>MG is owned by SAIC Motor, China's biggest automaker. SAIC is the largest Chinese EV company in Europe too. Another Chinese automaker, BYD, is growing fast. Other companies with complete or partial Chinese ownership include Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo and a number of EV brands including Polestar, Lynk &amp; Co. and British sports car maker Lotus.<br/>
名爵隶属于中国最大的汽车制造商上汽集团。上汽集团也是欧洲最大的中国电动汽车公司。另一家中国汽车制造商比亚迪正在快速发展。其他完全或部分拥有中国所有权的公司包括吉利，吉利拥有瑞典沃尔沃，以及包括极星、领克和英国跑车制造商莲花在内的多个电动汽车品牌。</p>
<p>Chinese EV makers combined sales are a small part of the 9.2 million vehicles sold in Europe every year. But Chinese EV builders have been taking up a piece of the smaller EV market at a fast rate.<br/>
中国电动汽车制造商的总销量只占欧洲每年920万辆汽车销量中的一小部分。但中国电动汽车制造商一直在快速占领小型电动汽车市场。</p>
<p>Schmidt's information suggests that Chinese automakers make up only about three percent of Western Europe's total car market, but Chinese manufacturers have 8.4 percent of the EV market. That number is up from 6.2 percent last year. In 2019, it was almost zero.<br/>
施密特的信息表明，中国汽车制造商仅占西欧汽车总市场的3%左右，但中国制造商占电动汽车市场的8.4%。这个数字比去年的6.2%有所上升。2019年，这一数字几乎为零。</p>
<p>The sales increase is leading some to worry about Europe's automotive industry. That powerful industry is mainly centered in France and Germany and employs many workers.<br/>
销量的增长导致一些人对欧洲汽车业感到担忧。这个强大的产业主要集中在法国和德国，雇佣了许多工人。</p>
<p>Last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, "Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars," with prices "kept artificially low by huge state subsidies."<br/>
上个月，欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩表示，“全球市场现在充斥着更便宜的中国电动汽车”，价格“被巨额国家补贴人为压低”。</p>
<p>A subsidy is government support that permits a company to sell products at unfairly low prices.<br/>
补贴是指政府支持使得公司可以以不公平的低价销售产品。</p>
<p>The commission, the EU's executive arm, officially opened its investigation this month, saying it would take up to 13 months and could result in import duties, another word for taxes.<br/>
欧盟执行机构欧盟委员会本月正式开始调查，称这将需要长达13个月的时间，并可能导致进口税。</p>
<p>China voiced "strong dissatisfaction" and promised to "firmly safeguard" Chinese companies' rights. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the EU investigation is based on "subjective assumptions," lacks enough evidence and goes against World Trade Organization rules.<br/>
中国表示“强烈不满”，并承诺“坚决维护”中国公司的权利。中国商务部表示，欧盟的调查是基于“主观假设”，缺乏足够的证据，违反了世界贸易组织的规定。</p>
<p>Executives at Shanghai-based Aiways, a company headed by Volvo's former China sales chief, rejected accusations that the Chinese government unfairly supports its businesses.<br/>
沃尔沃前中国销售总监领导的总部位于上海的爱威汽车公司的高管驳斥了有关中国政府不公平地支持其业务的指控。</p>
<p>"We're not selling inside China, we're not being subsidized in China," said Alexander Klose, vice president of overseas operations. Klose said his company does get "some subsidies for putting a plant somewhere," but added that he believes that is "what everybody has in Europe."<br/>
负责海外业务的副总裁亚历山大·克洛泽说：“我们不在中国境内销售，也不在中国获得补贴。”克洛泽说，他的公司确实“因为在某个地方建厂获得了一些补贴”，但他补充说，他相信这是“欧洲每家都有的”。</p>
<p>The EU should be working on getting to a "green future "rather than keeping competition out," he said.<br/>
他说，欧盟应该致力于实现“绿色未来”，而不是阻止竞争。</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>American high school students' scores on the ACT college admissions test have dropped to their lowest in more than 30 years.</p>
<p>The average score of students who completed high school in 2023 was 19.5 out of a possible 36. Last year, students averaged 19.8.</p>
<p>The average score dropped for the sixth straight year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An ACT Assessment preparation book is seen, April 1, 2014, in Springfield, Ill. " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/afddc5fe-a4a3-47d4-b891-f36ea79e675c_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An ACT Assessment preparation book is seen, April 1, 2014, in Springfield, Ill. </span></div>
<p>Scores were already falling before the COVID-19 pandemic. But the scores fell faster during and after the pandemic period.</p>
<p>The students who took the test in 2023 were in their first year of high school when COVID-19 reached the United States.</p>
<p>Janet Godwin leads ACT, the nonprofit organization that administers the test. She said that high schools are "not doing enough to ensure that graduates are truly ready for <strong>postsecondary</strong> success in college and career."</p>
<p>The average scores in reading, math and science were all below the level that ACT says demonstrates a good chance of succeeding in first-year college courses. The average score in English was just above the "<strong>benchmark</strong>" level, but it was still lower than in 2022.</p>
<p>The falling scores come at the same time many colleges and universities established admissions policies that do not require the test. However, students are welcome to provide the scores if they wish.</p>
<p>Some universities do not look at test scores even if students send them in. College admission tests have been criticized for favoring students who come from wealthier families and schools.</p>
<p>Godwin, however, said the test scores from her organization still help universities place students in the proper classes.</p>
<p>"Even in a test-optional environment, these kinds of objective test scores about <strong>academic</strong> readiness are <strong>incredibly</strong> important," she said.</p>
<p>Some current high school students wonder why the tests are necessary. Denise Cabrera is a 17-year-old in Hawaii. She said all of her classmates had to take the test in 11th <strong>grade</strong>.</p>
<p>Cabrera said she believed taking it and getting a good score would help her get into a good college. But she thinks colleges and universities can learn more about a student by looking at "different qualities ... outside of just a one-time test score."</p>
<p>Godwin said about 1.4 million high school students took the test this year. That was an increase over 2022 but still below the numbers recorded before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Only 21 percent of students reached the levels the ACT organization believes are necessary to predict good success in college.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>We all want to be a success in life. But success can look different from person to person. Perhaps the <u>key to success</u> is really knowing yourself. What do you want? What are your skills and <strong>strong suits</strong>? What are you really good at and what are you not?</p>
<p><u>Climbing the ladder of success</u> also requires different <strong>strategies</strong> in different industries. If want to be a success in a traditional corporate environment, you may have to wear business clothing like a suit. As they say, you may have to <u>dress for success</u>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Australian actress Margot Robbie arrives for the European premiere of Barbie in central London on July 12, 2023. The movie has been a huge success. (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/0c46d1b8-0cc9-4e5a-8d15-f575bb0ec75f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Australian actress Margot Robbie arrives for the European premiere of "Barbie" in central London on July 12, 2023.

<p>If want a creative job, you may need to wear the latest <strong>fashions</strong>. Again, English has a common expression about clothes and future job goals: "<u>Dress for the job you want, not the one you have."</u></p>
<p>However, success takes more than just the right clothes. It also takes hard work. Oftentimes others do not see all the hard work that goes into a project. They think success comes suddenly, for example overnight. Let's say an unknown writer <u>makes it big</u> with her first book. People may call her an <u>overnight success</u>. But they do not know about the many years she spent studying and writing.</p>
<p>Another<strong> ingredient</strong> in the <u>recipe for success</u> is a plan. To reach your goal, you need to get organized and break the goal down into doable steps. You know what they say – <u>if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.</u></p>
<p>Many English phrases make the <u>road to success</u> sound like a real physical path -- something we could find on a map.</p>
<p>Real roads are <strong>paved</strong> with materials such as <strong>asphalt</strong>. But when we talk about success, the roads to it are paved with different materials. Sometimes we say the roads are <u>paved with gold</u>. This suggests a place where success, especially financial wealth, is easy to come by.</p>
<p>For some people the road to success is paved with hard work or luck. Others may find their road to success is paved with failures. Learning from their failures taught them how to succeed.</p>
<p>Often if you follow the right road, you can achieve your goal. Then, life is filled with the <u>sweet smell of success</u>. You <u>have the world at your feet</u>. You are <u>riding high</u>. You've <u>got it made</u> and are <u>killing it.</u> You are <u>golden</u>. As you can see, we have many expressions describing success.</p>
<p>But make sure that you do not lose sight of what really makes you happy and successful. Some people <u>become a victim of their own success</u>. This means you start having problems because of your success. And that explains our final popular English saying, a gentle warning: <u>Be careful what you wish for: you just might get it.</u></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>How would you define success for your English studies? And do you have a plan to reach it? Go to our website and comment on the story. Or you can send us an email to this address: <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:LearningEnglish@voanews.com">LearningEnglish@voanews.com</a>.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Dwight Eisenhower. He took office in 1953 and was re-elected in 1956.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Dwight Eisenhower" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9d19cda0-2944-45f4-af72-7052bd01277a_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Dwight Eisenhower</span></div>
<p>Eisenhower was famous before he became president of the United States. He was a general in World War II, and led the Allied invasion of Europe. The attack began with the air and sea operation called D-Day.</p>
<p>As president, Eisenhower became known for his efforts to keep peace. He tried to have good relations with the Soviet Union especially. He believed one of the best ways to do that was to build America's military strength.</p>
<p>When Americans think of Eisenhower, they often note the growth of the U.S. defense industry, and tensions with the Soviet Union. Those tensions became known as the Cold War, and lasted long after Eisenhower left office.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Dwight David Eisenhower was born in Texas, but raised in the state of Kansas. His parents had seven sons. The future president was the third.</p>
<p>Eisenhower's parents did not have much money. His father worked as a mechanic. His mother was a member of the Mennonite Church, which opposed war and violence for any reason.</p>
<p>But young Dwight – who used the nickname "Ike" – enjoyed reading about military history and doing physical activities. He played football, and liked hunting and fishing.</p>
<p>When he finished high school, Eisenhower earned a position at the U.S. Military Academy, better known as West Point.</p>
<p>At first, he did not excel as a soldier. Eisenhower tested some of the Army's traditional ideas. But in time, military leaders came to value Eisenhower's ability to think independently and <strong>strategically</strong>.</p>
<p>He accepted increasingly important positions. In only a few years, Eisenhower took command of Allied troops during World War II. He directed invasions in North Africa, Italy, and finally in Western Europe.</p>
<p>His words "Okay, let's go" launched the invasion of Normandy, France on June 6, 1944.</p>
<p>Eisenhower's personal life changed during his military years. He married a young woman named <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/mamieeisenhower" target="_blank">Mamie Doud</a> in 1916. The following year they had a son named Doud Dwight; however, the boy became sick and died at the age of three.</p>
<p>In 1922, the Eisenhowers had a second son, named <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/us/john-eisenhower-historian-and-son-of-the-president-dies-at-91.html" target="_blank">John</a>.</p>
<p>Mamie and the boy spent many months separated from Dwight. And, even when the family was together, they were often moving from place to place. They moved nearly 30 times during Eisenhower's military career.</p>
<p>After he retired from <strong>active duty</strong> in the Army, Eisenhower accepted a position as president of Columbia University in New York. Then he returned to the military to lead NATO forces in Europe.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, Republican Party officials urged Eisenhower to be their candidate for president. Many Americans approved of Eisenhower's war record, his efforts to contain communism, and his wide smile. They seemed to agree with his campaign <strong>slogan</strong>, "I like Ike," and decisively elected him into office.</p>
<p>His 1952 election brought an end to the Democratic Party's 20-year control of the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Although he declared himself a Republican, Eisenhower was a political moderate in many of his ideas. He continued some of the <strong>domestic</strong> policies of former presidents<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-franklin-roosevelt/4046663.html" target="_blank"> Franklin Roosevelt</a> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-harry-truman/4067702.html" target="_blank">Harry Truman</a>.</p>
<p>Eisenhower also wanted the government to invest in public works projects. Notably, he approved a bill to build more than 65,000 kilometers of roads. Today the U.S. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.cfm">highway system</a> connects all parts of the country and supports the nation's economy.</p>
<p>Eisenhower also worked hard to have peaceful relations with other countries. In his first months as president, he signed the agreement that ended fighting in the Korean War.</p>
<p>He also tried to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union. In 1952, the U.S. government tested the <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-tests-first-hydrogen-bomb">first hydrogen bomb</a>. It was even more powerful than the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Soon, the Soviet Union carried out a hydrogen bomb test of its own.</p>
<p>The two countries became actively involved in an arms race that made many people around the world very, very nervous.</p>
<p>Eisenhower did not fully trust the Soviet leadership, but made some efforts to <strong>achieve</strong> an agreement on arms control. At the same time, he approved a plan for U.S. airplanes to fly secretly over the Soviet Union to gather information.</p>
<p>In 1959, Eisenhower and the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, met in the American state of Maryland. Modern presidents use a mountain <strong>retreat</strong> there, which Eisenhower called <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/how-did-camp-david-gets-its-name">Camp David</a>, after his grandson.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Soviet officials did not develop a treaty, but they did agree to meet again the following year.</p>
<p>However, the agreement collapsed. In 1960, Soviet missiles brought down one of the American spy planes, called a <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/u2-spy-incident">U-2</a>. The pilot was captured.</p>
<p>At first, Eisenhower's government denied that the plane was secretly gathering information. Officials said it was only a weather aircraft.</p>
<p>But then the Soviets produced evidence that the U-2 was, in fact, a spy plane. Khrushchev said he could not trust Eisenhower and his government, and he ended talks on limiting or disarming nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>During his two terms in office, Eisenhower tried many ways to avoid all-out war. He approved other secret actions, especially by the Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA . Eisenhower sent U.S. Marines into Lebanon to try to end unrest there. And he decided against ordering air strikes on Vietminh forces when they surrounded French troops at <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/french-defeated-at-dien-bien-phu">Dien Bien Phu</a>, Vietnam.</p>
<p>In all these efforts, Eisenhower used the threat of U.S. military power to help achieve his foreign policy goals. But he warned Americans against letting businesses aiding the defense industry become too powerful.</p>
<p>In his final speech as president, Eisenhower spoke of the dangers of what he called the <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/17/132942244/ikes-warning-of-military-expansion-50-years-later">military-industrial complex</a>. He did not want the country to depend only on war to resolve conflicts. And, he did not want the U.S. government to spend so much on weapons that it could not provide other services to Americans.</p>
<p>Shortly after that speech, Eisenhower retired to a home he and his wife had bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Many Americans were sad to see him go.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Eisenhower's presidency lasted most of the 1950s. During that time, the American economy was, for the most part, strong. Many Americans had enough money to buy homes and televisions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Eisenhower's presidency was a time of unease. Racial discrimination was intense. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_brown.html">declared</a> that states could no longer have separate public schools for white and black students. Some whites strongly objected to the decision. They tried to block black students from entering schools, sometimes using violence.</p>
<p>Eisenhower sent troops to enforce the federal law to <strong>desegregate</strong> public schools.</p>
<p>Later, Eisenhower used the power of his office to enforce other desegregation and voting rights laws. But he did not speak up strongly in support of civil rights. He thought both those who blocked civil rights legislation and those who demanded it were extreme.</p>
<p>Eisenhower also did not publicly criticize Senator Joseph McCarthy, who accused the U.S. government of protecting Soviet spies. Eisenhower strongly disliked McCarthy, but he permitted the "<a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare" target="_blank">Red Scare</a>" to continue until the lawmaker could discredit himself.</p>
<p>Finally, despite Eisenhower's efforts, the Cold War did not end; in fact, tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union increased. Although Eisenhower succeeded in keeping the country out of war, many events during his presidency created the conditions for later conflicts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Eisenhower was a popular president, both before, during, and after his time in office.</p>
<p>During his final years, he wrote several books about his life, traveled, and advised later presidents. He had suffered a heart attack during his first term in office, and eventually suffered another one.</p>
<p>He died at the age of 78 with his family by his side.</p>

<p>Australian researchers say they have produced the most complete history of the universe to date. An Australian National University team says the study offers new ideas about how the universe might have started.</p>
<p>The research team says the study's aim was to understand the beginnings of all the objects in the universe.</p>
<p>The American space agency, NASA, says the universe "includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A picture taken in Fontainebleau, southern Paris on August 13, 2023 shows shooting stars streaking across the Milky Way during the Nuits des &lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;233;toiles (Starry Night), a major annual celebration for astronomy enthusiasts.

<p>NASA adds that "the Milky Way is but one of billions of <strong>galaxies</strong> in the observable universe -- all of them, including our own, are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers."</p>
<p>A black hole is an area in space with gravity so strong that even light cannot escape it.</p>
<p>The Australian team says it has created the most complete <strong>maps</strong> showing the history of the universe.</p>
<p>The lead writer is honorary professor Charley Lineweaver. He said that when the universe began 13.8 billion years ago in a hot big bang, there were no objects, such as atoms, people, planets, stars, or galaxies.</p>
<p>The writers say the mapping provides new ideas about how the universe came into being.</p>
<p>The Australian National University (ANU) study is published in the most recent publication of <em>The American Journal of Physics. </em></p>
<p>The first map shows temperature and density of the universe as it expanded and cooled. The second map shows the mass and size of all objects in the universe.</p>
<p>The ANU researchers say the study suggests the universe may have started as what is known as an instanton not a singularity. An instanton has a defined size and mass. A singularity is defined as a point of <strong>infinite</strong> density and temperature.</p>
<p>Put simply, this would mean that the beginning of the universe was not infinite in size. That is important because researchers say that what lies beyond the limits of the universe is "also a major mystery."</p>
<p>Lineweaver told VOA that mapping the universe will increase our understanding of it.</p>
<p>"When you <strong>extrapolate</strong> in so many different ways it gives you just a lay of the land that I just think is a beautiful way of understanding the universe," he said. "If there is one way to understand the Big Bang, it started out hot and dense and it got cooler and less dense, and as it did that, particles and objects of all kinds <strong>condensed</strong> out of this hot, dense background."</p>
<p>He said that understanding that is something that we should all make an attempt to do because that is probably the most important understanding underlying the history of the universe.</p>
<p>Lineweaver says he believes that research into the beginning of the universe could help to answer some basic scientific questions about life beyond Earth.</p>
<p>"The basic idea is, well, if we can figure out how we got here, maybe we can make better guesses about whether other life forms have <strong>evolved</strong> elsewhere."</p>

            <title>New York Mayor Makes Robocalls in Different Languages Using AI  (2023/10/21)</title>

<p>New York Mayor Eric Adams has been using artificial intelligence (AI) to make robot phone calls in several languages.</p>
<p>The technology changes Adam's voice into languages that he does not speak. And it raises new ethical questions about the government's use of AI.</p>
<p>Adams told reporters about the phone calls, called robocalls, recently. He said they have gone out in languages like Mandarin and Yiddish for city events. They have not included any information that he only speaks English or that the calls were created using AI.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks in New York's Times Square during a news conference, Dec. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-fdee-08dbd0afeb39_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks in New York's Times Square during a news conference, Dec. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)</span></div>
<p>"People stop me on the street all the time and say, ‘I didn't know you speak Mandarin,'" Adams said. "The robocalls that we're using, we're using different languages to speak directly to the <strong>diversity</strong> of New Yorkers."</p>
<p>The calls come as questions arise over how best to use AI ethically and legally. <strong>Deepfake</strong> videos or audio can make it appear that anyone anywhere is doing anything a person on the other side of a computer screen wants them to do.</p>
<p>The Surveillance Technology Oversight Project called Adams' robocalls an unethical use of AI that is misleading to the people of New York.</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn is executive director of the organization. He said the calls are very unethical, especially because they are paid for with public money. "Yes, we need announcements in all of New Yorkers' native languages, but the deepfakes are just a <strong>creepy</strong> <strong>vanity</strong> project."</p>
<p>There is a growing use of artificial intelligence and deepfakes, especially in politics and election misinformation. It has led to calls for more rules and policing from the government and major media companies.</p>
<p>Google was the first big technology company to say it would identify political advertisements that use AI to fake a candidate's voice or actions. Meta does not have a rule specific to the use of AI in political ads. But the company has a policy restricting fake or <strong>manipulated</strong> audio and imagery used for misinformation.</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate would ban "materially <strong>deceptive</strong>" deepfakes relating to federal candidates, with exceptions for <strong>parody</strong>. This month, two Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to the heads of Meta and X, formerly known as Twitter. The letter shared concerns about AI-created political ads on social media platforms.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, a number of technology companies have shown off AI tools that can take a person's speech and make it sound as if that person is speaking a different language.</p>
<p>In September, the music streaming service Spotify introduced an AI feature to translate a recording, or podcast, into several languages in the speaker's voice. More recently, the startup ElevenLabs in October introduced a voice translation tool. The tool can change spoken words to another language while keeping the voice of the speaker.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Adams' office said they used the ElevenLabs tool for their robocalls. Native speakers listened to the recordings before they went out to make sure the translations were accurate. Calls have been made in Spanish, Yiddish, Mandarin, Cantonese and Haitian Creole.</p>
<p>Adams defended himself against ethical questions about his use of artificial intelligence, saying his office is trying to reach New Yorkers through the languages they speak.</p>
<p>"I got one thing: I've got to run the city, and I have to be able to speak to people in the languages that they understand, and I'm happy to do so," he said.</p>

<span class="datetime">20 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about using "when" with past simple or past continuous tenses.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3e4a-08dbd0147fdb_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm a learner from China. Could you please help me with the following question?</p>
<p>Is the sentence <em>The good news came when we weren't expecting it </em>grammatically correct?</p>
<p>If it is correct, how can we understand the following rule:</p>
<p>"As a general rule, you should use "while" in a clause with a continuous action, using a verb in a continuous tense. Use "when" in a clause with a single action, using a simple past or present tense."</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Jinye</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Jinye. Keep up the good work learning English with us!</p>
<p>The sentence "The good news came when we weren't expecting it" is grammatically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>When and while </strong></p>
<p>As for "when" and "while" we answered a question about <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/how-to-use-when-and-while-/5888101.html" target="_blank">How to Use ‘When' and ‘While'</a> in an earlier <em>Ask a Teacher</em> program.</p>
<p>We explained that some experts call both words "subordinating conjunctions" in some cases. This means they signal how pieces of information are related to one another. And we shared that general rule to give an idea of how they are used in English.</p>
<p>Let's look at these two examples:</p>
<p><em>When the phone rang, I was making dinner.</em></p>
<p><em>While I was making dinner, the phone rang.</em></p>
<p>"While" and "when" both relate to time although "while" usually signals that two events are happening at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Using English in real life</strong></p>
<p>Another issue to consider is how people use language in real life. Sometimes, the real-life use of language does not seem to equal textbook rules.</p>
<p>For example, many native users of English use "when" with continuous action. In fact, "when" is used with past progressive more often than "while" in the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/use-a-language-corpus-to-improve-your-vocabulary/7189316.html" target="_blank">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>. Here are some example sentences from the corpus.</p>
<p><em>When I was growing up, I wanted to be a cowboy.</em></p>
<p><em>I was thinking about her when we were talking.</em></p>
<p><em>When he was running for President, Obama gave electrifying speeches.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Jinye.</p>

<p>A team of scientists is studying the sound of the forest in Ecuador to learn how artificial intelligence (AI) could follow animal life in recovering environments.</p>
<p>When scientists want to measure new forest growth, they can study large areas of land with tools like satellites and <strong>lidar</strong>.</p>
<p>But understanding how fast and in what amount wildlife is returning to an area is more difficult. Sometimes it requires an expert to listen through sound recordings and pick out animal calls.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - View of the forest in Combu Island on the banks of the Guama River, near the city of Belem, Para state, Brazil, Aug. 6, 2023.

<p>Jorg Muller is a field expert on birds at the University of Wurzburg Biocenter in Germany. He wondered if there was a different way.</p>
<p>Muller told the French news agency AFP: "I saw the <strong>gap</strong> that we need, particularly in the tropics, better methods to <strong>quantify</strong> the huge <strong>diversity</strong>... to improve <strong>conservation</strong> actions."</p>
<p>So, he turned to bioacoustics, which uses sound to learn more about animal life and the environments in which they live.</p>
<p>The tool has been used by scientists for some time. But more recently, researchers are using it with computer learning to study large amounts of data more quickly.</p>
<p>Muller and his team recorded wildlife sounds at sites in Ecuador's Choco area. The environments they recorded included areas that were once used for agriculture and raising livestock to old-growth forests.</p>
<p>They first had experts listen to the recordings and index the sounds of different animals. Then, they examine the sound quality to measure the environment.</p>
<p>Finally, they ran two weeks of recordings through an AI computer program trained to understand 75 different bird calls.</p>
<p><strong>More recordings needed</strong></p>
<p>The program was able to pick out the calls on which it was trained. However, scientists wondered if the program could correctly identify the number of different kinds of plants and animals in each environment.</p>
<p>To see if the program could do that, the team used two different controls. One was from the experts who listened to the audio recordings, and the second was based on examples from each environment, which can be used to understand<strong> </strong>biodiversity.</p>
<p>Since the amount of available sounds used to train is limited, the AI program could only identify one-fourth of the bird calls that experts could. But it was still able to correctly measure biodiversity levels in each environment, the study said.</p>
<p>The research was published recently in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The study said the scientists' results show that the AI program is a powerful tool to measure the recovery of animal communities in <strong>tropical</strong> forests.</p>
<p>The research noted that biodiversity found from recordings can be quantified in a cost-effective and complete way. And it said that it can measure environments, "... from active agriculture to recovering and old-growth forests."</p>
<p>There are still areas for improvement, including the lack of animal sounds on which to train AI models. And the method can only capture animals that use sound to communicate.</p>

<p>People, animals and fish who depend on the waterways connected to the Amazon River close to the Brazilian city of Manaus are facing a long period of dry weather.</p>
<p>The city's port is an important economic area for northern Brazil. But recently, the water level of the area where the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers meet reached a very low level.</p>
<p>The civil defense agency in Amazonas state said the drought is hurting over 400,000 people.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="View of a stranded ferry boat at the Marina do Davi, a docking area of the Negro river, city of Manaus, Amazonas State, northern Brazil, on October 16, 2023.

<p>Those who have floating homes or use boats to move around on the river for work cannot travel. They cannot get fuel, food or fresh water.</p>
<p>Animals and fish along the river are dying. Thousands of dead fish float on the water's surface. A number of river dolphins died when they washed up on land. Dolphins are rare water mammals that live in Brazil's biggest rivers.</p>
<p>The organization that runs the port said the water level is only about 14 meters, the lowest since measurements started in 1902.</p>
<p>The <strong>previous</strong> all-time low came in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Without water, ‘there is no life'</strong></p>
<p>Brazil's <strong>monitoring</strong> and disaster alert center, Cemaden, said the rainfall in the Amazon area is the lowest it has been since July to September 1980.</p>
<p>The nation's science ministry said the weather pattern known as El Ni<i></i>241;o is to blame for the <strong>drought</strong> and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Reporters in the area are describing the situation as "<strong>grim</strong>."</p>
<p>Raimundo Silva do Carmo is a fisherman. But he cannot fish at this time. It takes him much of the day just to get water. One recent morning he was making his fourth visit of the day to a well east of Manaus.</p>
<p>He called carrying a water container back and forth "dreadful work" made harder because of the hot sun. "Without water," he said, "there is no life."</p>
<p>Another man, Joaquim Mendes da Silva is 73. For 43 years, he repaired ships on a large lake. The water is the lowest he has ever seen.</p>
<p>Children in the area stopped going to school one month ago because they could no longer travel by boat to the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>Along with Amazonas state, Cemaden said seven other states recorded their lowest rainfall in 40 years for the period from July to September.</p>
<p>The drought is hurting all of the waterways that connect to the Amazon River, an area that contains 20 percent of the world's fresh water. By last week, 42 of the 62 cities and towns in the area declared a state of emergency.</p>
<p>In one area, about 600 kilometers east of the lake, about 300 families are having trouble getting food and supplies in the Auati-Paraná reserve. They can only use small boats to get to the closest city. As a result, their travel time is 14 hours instead of the usual nine.</p>
<p>Along the river, people fish for a large fish called a pirarucu. The fish weigh as much as 200 kilograms. People catch the fish and then take them to local markets. They usually bring their catch to market by boat. But they can no longer sell the fish because they cannot reach the market.</p>
<p>Edvaldo de Lira is a local business leader. He said the fishermen "run the risk of catching fish in the lake, and it arrives <strong>spoiled</strong>. So, there is no way for us to fish," de Lira said.</p>
<p>Rain does not fall all year in the Amazon area. Rainfall is light from May to October, but the El Ni<i></i>241;o weather event is reducing the rain more than usual, said Ana Paula Cunha of Cemaden.</p>
<p>Climate scientists say the effects of El Ni<i></i>241;o this year are stronger because of global warming. Warming temperatures, they say, are because of carbon gases from years of burning coal, oil and gas.</p>
<p>One of the important rivers in the Amazon area is the Madeira. It travels over 3,500 kilometers from Bolivia to Brazil. Four of its five lowest water levels were recorded in the last four years, the Brazilian Geological Survey said.</p>
<p>In the port city of Porto Velho, the river's level is the lowest since measurements started in 1967. Brazil's fourth-largest hydroelectric dam, which produces power from water, is in nearby Santo Antonio. It stopped producing power last week for the first time since it opened in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Unprecedented difficulties</strong></p>
<p>For now, the Brazilian government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is sending food and water to the far away communities in the northern part of the country. Engineers will start digging paths along dry rivers for boat travel. Payments will soon go to families who cannot work.</p>
<p>But the problems will continue, experts say.</p>
<p>Photographs of dead dolphins appeared in newspapers and on television programs. Ayan Fleischmann is a hydrologist, or a scientist who studies water, at the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Institute. It describes itself as a social organization supervised by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. He said the photos were a "shock for everyone." He said the extreme heat may have hurt the organs of the dolphins or contributed to the growth of harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>"It was an unprecedented tragedy," he said. Unprecedented means never seen before.</p>
<p>Experts in Brazil from the National Institute for Space Research say the drought will likely continue until the end of 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A team of international scientists collected fish samples from an area near Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant Thursday. They are examining the effects of the recent release of treated radioactive water from the plant into the sea.<br/>
一个国际科学家小组星期四从日本福岛核电站附近地区采集了鱼类样本。他们正在研究最近处理过的放射性水从核电站排入大海的影响。</p>
<p>The study by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the first since the water release began in August. Local fishermen criticized the release. It also led China to ban all seafood products from Japan over food safety fears.<br/>
国际原子能机构的这项研究是自8月份开始排海以来的首次。当地渔民批评这次排海。这也导致中国出于对食品安全的担忧，禁止所有来自日本的海鲜产品。</p>
<p>Scientists from China, South Korea and Canada observed the collection of fish samples at Hisanohama Port, about 50 kilometers south of Fukushima.<br/>
来自中国、韩国和加拿大的科学家在福岛以南约50公里的久滨港观察了鱼类样本的采集情况。</p>
<p>The samples will be sent to laboratories in each country for independent testing, the U.N. nuclear agency said.<br/>
这家联合国下属的核机构表示，这些样本将被送往每个国家的实验室进行独立检验。</p>

<p>Consider almost any social or political issue. It could be local or international.</p>
<p>Some people have one idea about the issue, and other people have other ideas about the issue. In other words, people disagree with each other.</p>
<p>In this week's<em> Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore disagreements. We will learn about the verb, disagree, and the noun form, disagreement. We will learn some important ideas about how to use the terms.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-1795-08dbcffb2b0f_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Let's start with some history.</p>
<p><strong>History </strong></p>
<p>When we explore individual words, we often look at their histories. Words – like people – grow and change over time. By learning a little about these changes, we can make words more memorable and meaningful to us.</p>
<p>So, let's take a look at the verb "disagree."</p>
<p>Disagree first appeared in English over 500 years ago. The <em>Online Etymology Dictionary</em> tell us that disagree first meant "refuse <strong>assent</strong> to." It came from an Old French word desagreer, a word that we can break into two parts. Des- meant "not, opposite of" and agreer meant "to please; satisfy." In English, you might think of these two parts as dis- and agree.</p>
<p>With time, disagree took on new meanings. About 450 years ago, it took on the meaning of differing in opinion, or expressing differing views, the <em>Online Etymology Dictionary</em> tells us.</p>
<p>Some time later, we have the birth of the noun form disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>Usage </strong></p>
<p>We have followed disagree from its beginning. But how do we explain its modern usage?</p>
<p>One important idea is that we generally use disagree without an object. So, for example, you might say a simple, complete sentence such as this:</p>
<p><em>I disagree.</em></p>
<p>Or you might say this:</p>
<p><em>The two sides disagree.</em></p>
<p>But what about more complex sentences, you might ask? Internet data sources can give us some important information about how to do that.</p>
<p>Google's Ngram Viewer contains data from many written materials. We can do a careful study of exact words.</p>
<p>What <a class="wsw__a" href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=disagree+*&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-fiction-2019&amp;smoothing=3" target="_blank">Google's Ngram Viewer</a> tells us is that by far the most commonly used word after the verb disagree is the word "with." After the word "with," we generally have a pronoun, noun, or noun phrase.</p>
<p>So, for example, you might hear or read a sentence that involves a pronoun after "with," as in:</p>
<p><em>I disagree with you.</em></p>
<p>You might hear or read a sentence that has a noun after "with," as in:</p>
<p><em>He disagrees with Tom.</em></p>
<p>Or you might hear or read a sentence that has a noun phrase after "with," as in:</p>
<p><em>They disagree with these ideas.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>We disagree with the prime minister's policies.</em></p>
<p>What about the noun disagreement, you might ask?</p>
<p>Google's Ngram Viewer <a class="wsw__a" href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=disagreement+*+&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3" target="_blank">tells us </a>that once again, the word "with" is commonly used after the noun disagreement. So, you might hear or read the following:</p>
<p><em>He had a disagreement with his friend.</em></p>
<p>And what words might we use before the noun disagreement? <a class="wsw__a" href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=*+disagreement&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-fiction-2019&amp;smoothing=3" target="_blank">Google's Ngram Viewer tells us</a> we are more likely to hear or read the short word "a," as in "a disagreement," So, you might hear a person say:</p>
<p><em>They had a disagreement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quiz </strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed a difference between how we explored disagree and disagreement. We explored words that commonly come before and after disagreement, but we only explored a word that comes after the verb disagree. We did not explore the most common word that comes before disagree. Aside from pronouns, can you guess what the most common word is before the verb disagree?</p>
<p>Here is a hint: think about one short word that we often use before a verb in English.</p>

            <title>How Google's Antitrust Trial Could Change the Internet Search Market  (2023/10/19)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A court in the United States is hearing evidence in a case against search engine provider Google. The government accuses the company of using illegal methods to crush business competitors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is leading the case against Google in a court in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The trial could change the way Google is permitted to do business in the future. The case is one of the biggest antitrust trials in American history. Antitrust is a term relating to laws designed to prevent illegal competition.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Google sign is shown over an entrance to the company's new building in New York on Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2023." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4c21-08dbb2f1897a_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Google sign is shown over an entrance to the company's new building in New York on Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2023.</span></div>
<p>If the trial judge rules in favor of the government, the resulting punishment could lead to new online search possibilities for individual users and businesses.</p>
<p>Google's search engine earned a huge market share by helping people quickly connect to the wealth of information available on the internet. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the search technology in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>The Justice Department argues that Google has an unfair advantage in the market because its search engine is the <strong>default</strong> choice on the world's most popular smartphones and web browsers.</p>
<p>Witnesses from device makers, service providers and Google recently <strong>testified</strong> about one way the company's search engine is able to remain the default choice. They said the company pays an estimated $10 billion yearly to phone makers and other businesses in exchange for the default position.</p>
<p>In opening arguments, Justice Department lawyer Kenneth Dintzer said, "This case is about the future of the internet and whether Google will ever face meaningful competition in search."</p>
<p>Google has denied accusations that it uses unlawful methods to keep its huge market share. It says its search engine is wildly popular across the world because it offers users a high level of quality. Google lawyers have also argued that any users not happy with its search services can easily change to competitors.</p>
<p>But industry experts point out that many users choose to keep Google as the default so they do not have to take additional steps to change it. Research has shown that because of this ease, very few people change the default setting of Google.</p>
<p>The chief executives from two privacy-centered search engines, DuckDuckGo and Neeva, have argued that the default system favors Google and hurts their businesses. Neeva closed its operations earlier this year.</p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also testified that Google has established a strong hold over users over the years. "You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google," Nadella said. He added that the only way to break this dependence is to remove Google as the default choice.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, industry experts say the judge may order a requirement for smartphones and web browsers to present a series of search engines to users during the setup process. This is already being done in Europe. But research shows that so far, most European users are still choosing to go with Google.</p>
<p>Florian Schaub is a professor of information at the University of Michigan who has studied people's online behavior. He says the fairest result in the trial would be a total ban on default agreements between technology companies.</p>
<p>Schaub spoke to the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p>He said the current search environment is being shaped "by the big companies that control the space." He added, "What the government can do is inject some neutralism into this and give <strong>consumers</strong> some actual choices."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Justice Department lawyer accused Google in court of using unfair methods to push up internet advertising prices. The government <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">argues</a> that "Google now controls the digital tool that nearly every major website publisher uses to sell ads on their websites."</p>
<p>The Justice Department accuses Google of using unfair methods to control online <strong>auctions</strong> that connect buyers and sellers of online advertising. By making small changes to the auction system, Google can drive ad prices up to make more money, government lawyers say.</p>
<p>Advertisers and website publishers have long criticized Google's ad business as being too complex and secretive.</p>

            <title>Scientists: Chemical Used in Air Coolers Needs Replacing  (2023/10/19)</title>

<p>Jennifer Byrne owns a heating and air conditioning repair company in the American city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Air conditioning, or AC equipment, cools the air in a home. To do this, the equipment uses a gas called a refrigerant.</p>
<p>While working on AC equipment in a house, Byrne puts gas from the equipment into a special container.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Operators move a used refrigerant cylinder at the A-Gas Rapid Recovery DFW facility on Monday, Oct. 9, 2023, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Sam Hodde)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-a17b-08dbcf3bd83d_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Operators move a used refrigerant cylinder at the A-Gas Rapid Recovery DFW facility on Monday, Oct. 9, 2023, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Sam Hodde)</span></div>
<p>The gas is known by an industrial name: R-410A. Scientists say it traps 2,088 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Because chemical refrigerants capture heat, some people say they need to be replaced with something else. Some scientists are worried that the release of methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases is making the atmosphere warmer.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act bars businesses from releasing refrigerants into the air on purpose. Some companies are trying to find replacement gases that trap less heat, which might work almost as well.</p>
<p>Leaking AC equipment in homes is one way the gases get into the atmosphere. Cars are another <strong>source</strong> of these pollutants, said Eckhard Groll. He is an expert in refrigeration and head of mechanical engineering at Purdue University in the state of Indiana.</p>
<p>He said AC units in cars can leak. He said that, on average, about 25 percent of refrigerant from all cars leak out every year. There are more than 200 million gasoline cars in the U.S. alone, Groll said. Using those numbers, Groll said he estimates about 45 million kilograms of refrigerant is leaking into the atmosphere each year.</p>
<p>Supermarkets are the second-largest source of leaks. Long pipes carry refrigerant to coolers that store food. Danielle Wright is head of the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council, a nonprofit group based in Mill Valley, California. It supports cleaner methods of cooling.</p>
<p>Wright said the average supermarket leaks about 25 percent of its refrigerant each year. That number is based on a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report from 2005.</p>
<p>She criticized supermarkets, saying "...it's <strong>cheaper</strong> to leak the refrigerant than to build a leak-proof system."</p>
<p>Limiting leaks is important because the refrigerant can be reused. Many businesses <strong>recycle</strong> refrigerant gas. One such company, A-Gas, was founded in Britain in 1993. The company has several centers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Refrigerants can be used many times over and can last for 30 years, said Mike Armstrong, President of A-Gas in the Americas. The company takes in refrigerants and containers from around the U.S. and other countries. It processes the gas to be sold and used again. He said his business is doing well.</p>
<p>"This industry is probably going to increase four to five times in the next couple years," Armstrong said.</p>
<p>The chemical industry is also looking for a chemical to replace R-410A. Some researchers have suggested carbon dioxide itself as a possibility. But Groll of Purdue University said that carbon dioxide has to be under high pressure to work as a refrigerant. Completely different equipment would be necessary.</p>
<p>Christopher Cappa teaches environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. He said carbon dioxide would be useful "if we're pulling it out of the atmosphere." But he added, "if we're producing it just as a refrigerant, that wouldn't be necessarily nearly as good."</p>
<p><strong>Refrigeration easier to clean than air conditioning</strong></p>
<p>Wright of the Sustainable Refrigeration Council supports the use of carbon dioxide. "This is kind of a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/low-hanging-fruit/7025641.html">low-hanging fruit</a>, it's a known technology and it's market ready," she said.</p>
<p>However, she said that reducing leaks from air conditioners is more difficult. She said chemical and equipment manufacturers and existing building rules have slowed the growth of new refrigerants in the U.S.</p>
<p>But one manufacturer, Trane Technologies, said it has been working hard on different choices. Trane says it has a refrigerant that is 78 percent less damaging to the environment than the current one. The company says it will start using it in its equipment beginning in 2024.</p>
<p>And at Harvard University, researchers are working to develop a solid refrigerant instead of a gas. Jarad Mason, an assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, is working on the project.</p>
<p>He said he is hopeful about using solid materials because they could be used in both large buildings and normal homes.</p>
<p>"Demands for heating and cooling are only going to increase," he said. He added that researchers must find ways of cooling that do not harm the environment and are not costly.</p>

<p>Wine made by ancient methods is gaining new fans.</p>
<p>Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fruit like grapes.</p>
<p>Natural wine uses methods that reduce processing and harmful effects on the Earth. Research company IWSR Drinks Market Analysis found that people in the U.S. are seeking natural wine in increasing numbers. At the same time, the number of wine buyers has been dropping since 2015.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Interns at Pax Wines in Sebastopol, Calif., stomp organic grapes with their bare feet in large vats, pulling out the juice to start the fermentation process on Sept. 8, 2023.

<p>Natural and other Earth-friendly wines made up less than one percent of sales in 2021. But demand for those wines was rising faster than other kinds on the whole, reported Drizly, an online site for ordering and shipping wine and other alcohol.</p>
<p>Most natural wines are made with organic grapes collected by hand. Organic growers do not use poisonous chemicals to stop or control insects or<strong> </strong>unwanted plant growth.</p>
<p>To make wine, the grapes need to be crushed. Some wine producers crush grapes by foot like people of ancient times. Afterwards, the crushed grapes <strong>ferment</strong> naturally. Manufacturers do not add water, yeast or other substances.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. Some natural winemakers add sulfites, a chemical produced naturally in grapes. Extra sulfites can help preserve, or keep, the wine. And some winemakers clear the final liquid of any small pieces that could make it look cloudy.</p>
<p>The result is wines that are earthy and less predictable than many of the wines created by bigger producers.</p>
<p>"The first time you taste it, you can tell it's alive," said John Keller. He is the owner and winemaker at Neu Cellars in Northern Michigan.</p>
<p>But selling natural wine processes can be difficult. Natural wine has no set definition in the U.S. It is not easy to find, since most natural wines do not identify as such on their <strong>labels</strong>.</p>
<p>"Natural just sounds good, but <strong>conventional</strong> wine is pretty natural too," said Anita Oberholster. She is a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California, Davis. "If the idea of natural wine is going to grow, we should do research on it and define it."</p>
<p>Keller of Neu Cellars has a degree in biochemistry. He started out working for a big winemaker in California. But he left because he was not happy about all the chemical mixes it used. These include gelatin, oak dust, and eggs.</p>
<p>However, some say the line between natural and conventional wines is very narrow.</p>
<p>Many products added to wine, like yeast, are natural products, Oberholster said. And many conventional wines are made without adding anything.</p>
<p>Some in the industry would like to establish rules<strong> </strong>for producing natural wine. France's wine industry took such action in 2020, enacting requirements that winemakers must meet to identify their wines as natural.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers argue that rules can make wine making more costly. Keller uses organic grapes but he says he cannot support the cost of repeated inspections for approval as an organic wine.</p>
<p>Anthony Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of Vinovest, a wine investment company. He sees another problem.</p>
<p>Vinovest says some wine companies are profiting from the lack of rules. They use labeling content like imagery that suggests their wine making is natural when they are not, he argues.</p>
<p>That can mislead buyers who often will pay higher prices for wines made by smaller producers that use natural methods.</p>
<p>However, buyers may have more information on wine bottles soon. Starting in December, wines sold in the European Union will have to identify on their labeling all the substances each product contains.</p>
<p>Oberholster expects the U.S. to pass similar measures as well in the next few years.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel on Wednesday after the October 7 attack by the militant group Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people.</p>
<p>In addition to talks with Israeli leaders, Biden had planned to visit Jordan. But, that part of his plan was canceled after an explosion killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza.</p>
<p>Since the attack by Hamas on civilians earlier this month, Israel has answered with air strikes and other attacks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (L) greets US President Joe Biden upon his arrival at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport on October 18, 2023, amid the ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.

<p>Hamas fighters said Israel was to blame for the blast that they said killed about 500 people. Israel's defense force responded, saying the explosion came from an off-target rocket fired by the Islamic Jihad militant group.</p>
<p>Before the explosion, Biden was supposed to speak with King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss humanitarian aid for Gazans.</p>
<p>Israel has promised a full ground invasion of Gaza and asked that Palestinians living in the northern part of the territory <strong>evacuate</strong> to the south. About 600,000 people so far have followed the order.</p>
<p>About 3,000 Palestinians have died during Israel's operations, the Gaza Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>Biden said he was given information from U.S. military experts that made him believe the hospital explosion was not from an Israeli weapon. While in Israel, he said he was sad to see what happened to the hospital, but "it appears it was done by the other team, not you."</p>
<p>Islamic Jihad says it was not responsible for the explosion.</p>
<p>Biden said he understands that many people watching the conflict from afar might not believe him.</p>
<p>He told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that "Americans are <strong>grieving</strong>," and "worried" about how difficult it will be for Israel to respond to the attack.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said Wednesday that Biden spoke with King Abdullah II and chose to postpone his travel to Jordan.</p>
<p>As Biden was in Israel, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a humanitarian cease-fire that would permit Hamas to release Israeli hostages. In addition, the U.N. would like Israel to re-open its borders with Gaza to permit food and water to enter.</p>
<p>The U.S. president said he was concerned that food and other aid would not reach the Palestinian people who need it the most.</p>
<p>"If Hamas <strong>diverts</strong> or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people," Biden said.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. approved $100 million in aid if it could be delivered to the neediest people.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Biden's visit was "deeply moving." Biden said the U.S. would continue to support Israel but also work "to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians."</p>
<p><strong>UN Concerns</strong></p>
<p>The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations is Riyad Mansour. He said the meeting with Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian leaders would only happen if Biden were to negotiate a cease-fire.</p>
<p>Israel is being criticized for cutting off electricity and restricting entry to Gaza. European Council President Charles Michel called Israel's tactic "not in line with international law."</p>

<p>A new study suggests changes in world climate and land use are sharply reducing the number of insects needed for <strong>pollinating</strong> crops.</p>
<p>The study looked at thousands of species and areas around the world. It found that the number of pollinating insects dropped by 61 percent during periods of abnormally high temperatures and reduced supply of flowering plants.</p>
<p>Leaders of the study noted that bees, flies, moths and other pollinators are more affected than the general insect population. Results of the research recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh0756">appeared</a> in the publication <em>Science Advances</em>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Bees and other insects gather on a sunflower at the Agro Brasilia, an agricultural exhibition on the outskirts of Brasilia, Brazil, May 18, 2012.

<p>"We're seeing the climate change is already having this really strong <strong>impact</strong> on pollinators," study co-writer Tim Newbold told The Associated Press. He is an ecologist at the University College of London.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates about 35 percent of world food crops and 75 percent of flowering plants depend on insects and other animal pollinators to reproduce.</p>
<p>The study found the biggest problems with pollinator loss are in the tropics – areas that sit close to Earth's equator. The countries most at risk of crop loss from reduced pollinators include China, India, Indonesia and Brazil. Sub-Saharan Africa is also in danger, especially its cocoa and mango crops, the study found.</p>
<p>Given the current situation, the researchers said some important tropical crops – especially coffee and cocoa – could be badly hurt. Those plants depend heavily on bees and flies to help them reproduce.</p>
<p>Past studies have shown insect populations are decreasing for several reasons, including climate change and loss of <strong>habitat</strong>.<strong> </strong>Other studies have shown shrinking numbers of pollinators, with coffee and cocoa plants especially harmed by the absence.</p>
<p>Newbold, from the University College of London, said he sees a "double hit of climate change" affecting the coffee plants themselves, as well as the pollinators they depend on.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that there will be no coffee or chocolate available, said the study's lead writer, Joe Millard. It will just mean buyers will have to pay more for them. Millard is a computational ecologist at the Natural History Museum in London.</p>
<p>University of Delaware insect expert Douglas Tallamy – who was not part of the research – said this study is unusual because it centered on the tropics, which other research has not. "We're not paying enough attention to the tropics," Tallamy said. "They are important."</p>
<p>Newbold noted that pollinating insects in the tropics are likely hit harder than other places because they are already near their temperature limits that place them at risk. "Massive warming in the tropics is pushing those species over the edge," Newbold said.</p>
<p>Habitat loss is the main driver for the shrinking number of pollinators because it leaves less food for them, Millard said. Climate change, <strong>parasites</strong>, disease, and chemicals in the environment add to that difficulty.</p>
<p>Newbold said scientists are still trying to find out why pollinators seem to be suffering worse effects from warming temperatures than other insects. It could be because they have hairier legs and bodies that help them carry <strong>pollen</strong>, the researchers said.</p>
<p>It is like "being forced to have a big furry coat and it's getting hot," Newbold said.</p>
<p>But the University of Delaware's Tallamy is not so sure. He said that the study's data is solid, but its explanation as to cause of impact is more of a <strong>guess</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>
California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law last week permitting low-income Mexican students to pay the same cost as Californians to attend some community colleges.<br/>
加州州长加文·纽瑟姆上周签署了一项法律，允许低收入的墨西哥学生支付与加州人相同的费用进入一些社区大学。</p>
<p>The law starts next year and will run as a pilot, or test program, for five years. The program is open to Mexican students who live within 72 kilometers of the U.S. border in California.<br/>
该法律将于明年开始实施，并将作为试点或测试项目运行五年。该项目对居住在美国加州州界72公里以内的墨西哥学生开放。</p>
<p>In California, the Education Data Initiative says the average yearly cost of tuition at community colleges for Californians is $1,500. For out-of-state students, the yearly cost is nearly $10,000. It means a possible saving of more than $8,000 for some Mexican students under the program.<br/>
在加州，教育数据倡议组织表示，加州人在社区大学的平均年学费为1500美元。对于州外的学生来说，每年的费用将近1万美元。这意味着该项目可能为一些墨西哥学生节省8000多美元。</p>
<p>David Alvarez is a California state lawmaker who worked on the law. He said many Mexicans travel between the two countries to work or visit family. And the law will help make education readily available to prepare them for jobs.<br/>
大卫·阿尔瓦雷斯是加州的一名州议员，他曾参与这项法律的制定。他说，许多墨西哥人往返于两国之间工作或探亲。这项法律将有助于他们随时接受教育，为就业做好准备。</p>
<p>Alvarez said in a statement that the program would help "prepare a more diverse population among our workforce."<br/>
阿尔瓦雷斯在一份声明中表示，该计划将有助于“在我们的劳动力中培养更多样化的人群”。</p>
<p>Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California, is just 11 kilometers from the U.S. border with Mexico. The college's president Mark Sanchez said many students at the school split their time between the two countries.<br/>
位于加州丘拉维斯塔的西南学院距离美国与墨西哥的边境只有11公里。该学院院长马克·桑切斯表示，该校许多学生穿梭于两国之间。</p>
<p>"Without this pilot, we risk everything in terms of loss of talent," he told lawmakers at a hearing last June.<br/>
他在去年6月的一次听证会上对议员表示：“如果没有这个试点，我们将面临人才流失的风险。”</p>
<p>Students from Mexico who decide to go to Southwestern College will save about $7,000 based on the lower cost for Californians.<br/>
来自墨西哥的学生如果决定去西南学院，将在享受加州人低廉学费的基础上节省约7000美元。</p>
<p>The law requires community colleges to report by 2028 on the attendance and the number of students receiving in-state tuition under the program.<br/>
该法律要求社区大学在2028年前报告入学率和根据该计划享受州内学费的学生人数。</p>
<p>In 2015, California passed a similar law that permitted students who lived close to its border with Nevada to attend Lake Tahoe Community College at in-state tuition.<br/>
2015年，加州通过了一项类似的法律，允许居住在加州与内华达州边境附近的学生以州内学费进入太浩湖社区学院。</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic showed how useful digital technology could be for schools. But it also showed the limitations of technology in the educational setting. Millions of students were able to attend classes online to avoid spreading the virus. But many students failed to learn by such methods. Their educational progress slowed and in some cases went backwards.</p>
<p>Digital tools and the internet have made it easier for students to <strong>access</strong> educational resources. However, a large number of schools around the world remain unconnected to the internet. Additionally, digital tools have entered markets that have no official supervision. Such educational products do not require any testing or proof as to their value to schools and learners.</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) argues against unsupervised wide use of digital tools and AI in education. A recent UNESCO report says there is little evidence that wide technology use improves learning. The organization says digital educational tools can never replace the human connection of teacher and student.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Michael Burton-Straub, left, and Declan Lewis attempt to Find the Bot in Donnie Piercey's class at Stonewall Elementary in Lexington, Ky., Monday, Feb. 6, 2023.&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;160; (AP Photo/Timothy D.

Easley)</span></div>
<p>Audrey Azoulay is UNESCO's Director General. She says there is a very large divide, or gap, between rich and poor countries when it comes to digital resources. Just 40 percent of primary schools worldwide have access to the internet, she said. Many schools also lack electricity, especially in Africa and Central and Southern Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, just 32 percent of schools have electricity.</p>
<p>And, internationally, about one-third of students were unable to attend online classes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Even if connectivity was universal, it would still be necessary to demonstrate ...that digital technology offers real added value in terms of effective learning," the report says.</p>
<p>Often, technology changes faster than it is possible to study it, the report says. Educational technology products change every three years on average. In Britain, for example, just seven percent of educational technology companies had done studies to judge the effectiveness of their products.</p>
<p>UNESCO also reported that many companies pay for studies on the effectiveness of their own product. These studies are not independent examinations.</p>
<p>Pearson, an education technology company, has a tool called Successmaker for teaching math and reading. Independent studies show the tool has little or <strong>negative</strong> effectiveness in learning. But the company stands by the results of the private study it paid for. That study found the product very helpful to learning.</p>
<p>UNESCO says such companies need to be better regulated. Azoulay said just 14 percent of countries require data protection in education.</p>
<p>"Student data should not be used either by education technology or advertising technology companies for marketing purposes," the report says. Yet a study of 163 products found that 89 percent of them gathered student data and sent them to third-party companies, often for advertising purposes. This usually happened without the student or parent knowing, the study said.</p>
<p>UNESCO argues that technology holds great possibilities for education. But studies have shown that educational technologies are most effective when a teacher is involved in the <strong>instructional</strong> process.</p>
<p>"We must never forget the social and emotional <strong>dimensions</strong> of teaching and learning," Azoulay said, adding, "no screen will ever replace a teacher."</p>

            <title>Pepper X Sets Guinness Record for Hottest Pepper  (2023/10/18)</title>

<p>Ed Currie is the pepper expert who grew the Carolina Reaper, which has been considered the hottest pepper in the world since 2013. Ten years later, Currie broke his record with one that is three times hotter: Pepper X.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records named Currie’s latest creation the world’s <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/10/pepper-x-dethrones-carolina-reaper-as-worlds-hottest-chilli-pepper-759706">“hottest chili pepper”</a> this month.</p>
<p>Guinness uses what are called Scoville Heat Units (SHU) to measure heat in a chili pepper. A normal jalapeno pepper registers about 5,000 units. A habanero, the record-holder about 25 years ago, reaches 100,000 SHU.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Pepper X pepper is shown on Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023, in Fort Mill, S.C. The pepper variety is now the hottest pepper in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records (AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/sp/01000000-0aff-0242-0f71-08dbcf20c95f_cx0_cy11_cw84_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>The Carolina Reaper held the record since 2013 with 1.64 million SHU. And Pepper X is the new record holder with an average of 2.69 million units. By comparison, pepper spray commonly carried by police is around 1.6 million units. And bear spray, a product to keep bears away, is advertised to have 2.2 million units.</p>
<p>Currie said when he first tried Pepper X, “I was feeling the heat for three-and-a-half hours.” Currie, one of only five people so far to eat an entire Pepper X added, “Then the <strong>cramps</strong> came.” The cramps, he said, left him lying in pain for another hour.</p>
<p>Currie started working on Pepper X after he set the record in 2013 with the Carolina Reaper. He <strong>crossbred</strong> 100 different kinds of peppers every year for 10 years. Currie hoped that just one or two would make it through the development process. His goal was to offer an extremely hot pepper flavored with a little sweetness.</p>
<p>Pepper X is greenish yellow. It is a crossbreed of a Carolina Reaper and, what Currie mysteriously called, a “pepper that a friend of mine sent me from Michigan that was brutally hot.”</p>
<p>The chemical in peppers that causes the burn is called capsaicin. The chemical causes a burning sensation when it touches human tissue. The burning sensation is also said to release chemicals into the body called endorphins and dopamine.</p>
<p>Currie started growing peppers after ending drug and alcohol <strong>addictions</strong>. He considers that sensation a natural “high.” He shares his peppers with medical researchers, hoping they can use them to treat disease and help people who suffer <strong>chronic</strong> pain or discomfort.</p>
<p>Currie is trying to build a business with his new creation. In the past, Currie permitted people to grow his peppers without protecting his ideas. His lawyers say they have counted more than 10,000 products that use the Carolina Reaper name, or other <strong>intellectual property</strong>, without permission.</p>
<p>For Pepper X, he said no seeds will be released without his permission. “Everybody else made their money off the Reaper. It’s time for us to reap the <strong>benefits</strong> of the hard work I do,” Currie said.</p>
<p>Currie wants people to eat peppers and thinks they can gain from the experience that comes after the burn. He warns people from reaching too quickly for a Carolina Reaper or Pepper X.</p>
<p>When asked if Pepper X is the “pinnacle” or the hottest a pepper can be, Currie said with a smile, “No, it’s not the pinnacle.”</p>

            <title>Groups Demand Urgent Rules to Protect Whales from Ships  (2023/10/17)</title>

<p>An alliance of environmental groups is calling for new federal rules to protect an endangered whale from crashes with ships.</p>
<p>The groups presented their demands in a document, called a petition, provided to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on September 28.</p>
<p>The action aims to protect the North Atlantic right whale, which has long been considered endangered. The population of these extremely large sea animals has decreased sharply in recent years. Just 340 are believed to be alive today.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A North Atlantic right whale is seen feeding on the surface of Cape Cod bay off the coast of Plymouth, Mass., March 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-97ad-08dbcb2ccb79_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A North Atlantic right whale is seen feeding on the surface of Cape Cod bay off the coast of Plymouth, Mass., March 28, 2018.

<p>Officials at NOAA have said ship collisions are among the most serious threats to the survival of the whale. One rule the environmental groups are calling for would seek to prevent ship strikes by making more ships slow down for whales. NOAA has yet to release a final updated speed rule although it proposed new rules more than a year ago, the groups said.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have appealed for urgency in enacting the measure. They say it is important to approve new rules before the upcoming birthing season. At that time of year, the whales migrate hundreds of miles from waters off New England and Canada to areas off the coasts of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>"Even one ship strike would bring these whales closer to <strong>extinction</strong>, but speed limits can help prevent that," said Kristen Monsell. She is a legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that prepared the petition to NOAA. "Federal officials can't sit back and do nothing while right whales are in danger," Monsell told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Katie Wagner is a spokesperson for NOAA. She said she expects the agency to announce its final action on the proposed rule sometime this year. That means the rule could be publicized during the middle of <strong>calving</strong> season and may not be put into effect until even later.</p>
<p>Wagner said NOAA knows about the petition but has a policy not to comment on legal matters. The agency is considering expanding "slow zones" off the U.S. East Coast, and also requiring more ships to obey those rules.</p>
<p>NOAA denied a request from environmentalists last year to immediately put new rules in place. At the time, the agency said in public documents that it was considering "long-term, <strong>substantive</strong>" measures to reduce whale strikes by ships. Wagner said NOAA received more than 90,000 comments on the proposed rule and would use those to decide on its final action.</p>
<p>Right whales were once common off the U.S. East Coast. But the animals fell in numbers after years of heavy hunting activities. The whales have long been protected under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>Right whales are also at risk of becoming accidentally <strong>entangled</strong> in fishing equipment. Proposed restrictions to prevent such entanglements have been the subject of a legal case between the federal government and fishermen.</p>

比尔·盖茨告诉美联社：“无论是针对非洲的局部疾病，如裂谷热，还是针对结核病，信使核糖核酸看起来都是一种非常有前景的方法。”</p>
<p>The Microsoft founder added, during a visit to the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, "And so it allows us to bring in lots of African capabilities to work on these vaccines, and then this can be scaled up."<br/>
这位微软创始人在访问位于塞内加尔达喀尔市的巴斯德研究所时补充道，“因此，这使我们能够引入大量非洲能力来研究这些疫苗，然后可以扩大规模。”</p>
<p>The announcement came as the foundation opened its yearly three-day Grand Challenges event. The gathering brought together scientists and public health researchers from around the world.<br/>
值此消息宣布之际，该基金会一年一度的为期三天的“大挑战”活动拉开了帷幕。这次活动汇集了来自世界各地的科学家和公共卫生研究人员。</p>
<p>Institut Pasteur, along with South Africa-based company Biovac, will be using an mRNA research and manufacturing process developed by Quantoom Biosciences in Belgium.<br/>
巴斯德研究所和南非Biovac公司将使用比利时Quantoom生物科学公司开发的信使核糖核酸研发和制造工艺。</p>
<p>The foundation is giving five million dollars to each vaccine manufacturer. It will award another $10 million to other companies not yet identified. The remaining $20 million is going to Quantoom "to further advance the technology and lower costs."<br/>
该基金会向每家疫苗制造商捐赠500万美元。它将向其他尚未确定的其它公司再奖励1000万美元。剩下的2000万美元将用于Quantoom公司“进一步推进技术和降低成本”。</p>
<p>Pfizer and its partner BioNTech along with Moderna used the mRNA technology to develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The medicine supplies genetic direction to human cells leading to antibody production to fight COVID-19.<br/>
辉瑞公司及其合作伙伴BioNTech，连同莫德纳公司在打破记录的时间内使用mRNA技术开发了新冠肺炎疫苗。该药物为人类细胞提供基因方向，从而产生抗体来对抗新冠肺炎。</p>
<p>Those COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were quickly pushed through approval processes and received emergency use permission during the pandemic. The new vaccines under development in Africa will take longer anywhere from three to seven years.<br/>
这些新冠肺炎mRNA疫苗很快通过了审批程序，并在大流行期间获得了紧急使用许可。非洲正在研发的新疫苗需要三到七年的时间。</p>
<p>Dr. Amadou Sall is chief executive officer at Institut Pasteur. He said the deal will help build vaccine self-reliance in Africa. The organization has been producing yellow fever shots since the 1930s. It now hopes mRNA technology can be used to produce vaccines for other diseases in Africa including Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.<br/>
阿马杜·萨尔博士是巴斯德研究所的首席执行官。他说，该协议将有助于非洲建立疫苗自力更生的能力。自20世纪30年代以来，该组织一直在生产黄热病疫苗。它现在希望信使核糖核酸技术可以用于生产非洲其他疾病的疫苗，包括拉萨热、裂谷热和克里米亚-刚果出血热。</p>
<p>"What we want is next time there is a pandemic — we hope it won't happen soon — Africa would be able to make its own vaccine, to contribute to the development, and make sure that we protect the population," Sall said. "What happened with COVID should never happen again in the sense that Africans should get vaccinated as a matter of equity."<br/>
萨尔说：“我们希望下次疫情爆发时非洲将能够制造自己的疫苗，为发展做出贡献，并确保我们保护人民。当然我们希望下次疫情不会来得那么快。从非洲人应该公平接种疫苗的意义上讲，新冠肺炎的情况不应该再次发生。”</p>
<p>Jose Castillo is the leader of Quantoom Biosciences. He said the mRNA technologies permit low- and middle-income countries "to become autonomous in terms of research and development."<br/>
何塞·卡斯蒂略是Quantoom生物科学公司的负责人。他说，信使核糖核酸技术能够让中低收入国家“在研发方面实现自主”。</p>
<p>With $8.3 billion to give away in 2023, the Gates Foundation is the world's largest private philanthropic donor. The organization has spent billions of dollars to vaccinate against polio, treat and prevent malaria and HIV and, more recently, to develop vaccines for diseases like cholera.<br/>
盖茨基金会是世界上最大的私人慈善捐赠机构，它将在2023年捐出83亿美元。该组织已花费数十亿美元接种脊髓灰质炎疫苗，治疗和预防疟疾和艾滋病毒，最近还开发了霍乱等疾病的疫苗。</p>

<p>Emergency aid for Gaza was being held up at a border crossing in Egypt Monday as Israel continued to launch air strikes into the Palestinian-ruled territory.</p>
<p>Egyptian officials said Israel has not cooperated in recent days with efforts to get large aid shipments into Gaza from a crossing in Rafah, Egypt.</p>
<p>On Friday, Israel began ordering Palestinians to leave Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, telling them to head to the south. Israeli officials say the order was issued ahead of a planned military ground campaign against forces of Palestinian ruler Hamas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Palestinians carry a person wounded in Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Monday, October 16, 2023.

<p>Hamas militants have built major military bases in the north. Israel's expected ground offensive there is expected to center on killing Hamas leaders, recovering captives, and destroying the group's military equipment, The Associated Press (AP) reported.</p>
<p>More than a million people had already fled their homes in northern Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion.</p>
<p>Israel has continued to attack positions in Gaza after Hamas launched a major military operation into southern Israel on October 7. Israeli airstrikes have destroyed whole neighborhoods as Palestinian militants continued firing rockets into Israel.</p>
<p>Israeli officials say more than 1,400 Israelis – including many civilians – have died in the conflict. Health ministry officials in Gaza say at least 2,750 Palestinians have been killed and 9,700 injured since the Hamas attacks began.</p>
<p>Israel controls the other two crossing points into Gaza. But it has declared a "complete <strong>siege</strong>" of the coastal Palestinian territory. This means Israel has cut off food, water, fuel and electricity supplies to the area.</p>
<p>Gaza has been under a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade ever since Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007. The blockade closely controls movements of goods and people into Gaza.</p>
<p><strong>Mediators</strong> have pressed in recent days for a cease-fire that would permit the waiting aid to enter, as well as give foreigners a chance to leave Gaza.</p>
<p>The AP reported Egypt's foreign minister as saying Israel "has not taken a position to open the crossing from the Gaza side." The Israeli government did not immediately answer a request from AP for comment.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Palestinians crowded hospitals and schools Monday seeking shelter as food, water and medicine remained in short supply.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering in U.N. centers are getting less than 1 liter of water per day, the AP reported. Hospitals warned of operations nearing collapse because of power and fuel shortages.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned about disease spread linked to mass displacements and poor water quality. Four hospitals in northern Gaza are no longer operating and 21 had received Israeli orders to close. Many doctors have so far refused, saying it would mean death for critically ill patients and people receiving breathing assistance.</p>

            <title>Google Says AI-powered System Is Improving City Traffic Flows  (2023/10/16)</title>

<p>Google says an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered system it created is helping improve traffic flow in major world cities.</p>
<p>The system, called Project Green Light, is currently in use in 12 cities. The project aims to save fuel and lessen air pollution, or emissions, from automobiles.</p>
<p>Google first announced the program in 2021, when it was testing the system in four areas of Israel. Since then, the company has kept expanding Project Green Light. Among cities now taking part in the program are Bangalore, Budapest, Jakarta, Manchester, Haifa, Hamburg, Rio de Janeiro, and Seattle.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Vehicles are caught in congestion as the flow of traffic increases at toll road in Cikarang, West Java, Indonesia, Friday, April 29, 2022.

<p>In an <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-ai-reduce-greenhouse-emissions-project-greenlight/">online announcement</a>, Google's Yossi Matias explained the latest progress. He noted that the system is being tested in areas with severe traffic issues. Generally, this is at major crossings with heavy traffic and complex traffic lights. These areas where vehicles start and stop are known as intersections.</p>
<p>The company said research has shown that at such intersections, automobile emissions can be 29 times higher than on open roads. In addition, Google's own research found that vehicles that must stop and start account for about half of those emissions.</p>
<p>Project Green Light uses individual driver data from Google Maps. This data is combined with AI methods to produce models of each intersection where the system is in place, the company says. The data from Maps is also used to create another model on how different traffic lights interact.</p>
<p>The modeling process for intersections considers several elements. These include the structure of streets, traffic flows, signal scheduling and how the vehicles interact with lights.</p>
<p>The models are used to reduce stop and start times and create smoother traffic flows, a process called optimization. Google says one goal is to optimize multiple intersections at the same time to create "waves of green lights" for vehicles on the road.</p>

            <title>App Shows How Ancient Greek Buildings Looked Thousand Years Ago  (2023/10/16)</title>

<p>If you visit the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, you will see the rocky grounds high above the city that include the famous ruins of the Parthenon.</p>
<p>However, if you use a new <strong>app</strong> from Greece's culture ministry, you can see what the building and grounds looked like more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The app lets visitors see the famous place in its true <strong>glory</strong>, with the bright colors and details it had in the past. <strong>Archaeologists</strong> and other historians worked to create digital images showing how the Acropolis looked when it was new.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man holds up a tablet showing a digitally overlayed virtual reconstruction of the ancient Parthenon temple, at the Acropolis Hill in Athens, Greece on Tuesday, June 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/6a707333-5c66-4d5e-b91a-d288779f7611_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A man holds up a tablet showing a digitally overlayed virtual reconstruction of the ancient Parthenon temple, at the Acropolis Hill in Athens, Greece on Tuesday, June 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)</span></div>
<p>In the app, the Parthenon, for example, has its famous <strong>marble</strong> sculptures that are now at the British Museum in London. The app lets visitors see the sculptures where they used to be near the Parthenon. Greece wants Britain to return the sculptures.</p>
<p>Experts say the app, called Chronos, is an example of how Artificial intelligence, or AI, technology is being used to tell the stories of the past.</p>
<p>The technology that expands what people can see is called <strong>augmented reality</strong> or AR. Companies such as Meta and Apple are making big investments in apps and <strong>hardware</strong> that can bring the technology to more people.</p>
<p>Maria Engberg recently wrote a book about the subject. She said most people will first experience augmented reality through their phones at places like the Acropolis.</p>
<p>She said travelers will see the technology when they take tours. They will be able to see photos and videos as they walk around historic places. Engberg is a professor at Malmo University in Sweden.</p>
<p>"I think we will see really interesting customer experiences in the next few years as more <strong>content</strong> from museums and archives becomes <strong>digitized</strong>," she said.</p>
<p>The government and other groups are making investments in AR as more visitors come to Greece following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitors to Greece in the first half of 2023 increased by over 20 percent compared to 2022, bringing over $10 billion to the Greek economy.</p>
<p>Microsoft worked with the Greek culture ministry to create a digital tour of Olympia, the home of the first Olympic Games. Lina Mendoni leads the agency. Earlier this year, she said the new technology lets "real visitors and <strong>virtual</strong> visitors anywhere around the world share historical knowledge."</p>
<p>Cosmote is the Greek telecommunications company that worked on the Chronos app. Panayiotis Gabrielides of Cosmote said advanced smart phones and faster communications networks will permit visitors to "download even higher-quality content." He said more guides and features will be available soon.</p>
<p>But for now, visitors can use Chronos to see how the Parthenon and other parts of the Acropolis once looked.</p>

<p>Banana plant <strong>stems</strong> are mostly useless following harvest of the fruit. It takes time and work to remove the stem from the ground. Then the farmers have to crush the plant waste to small pieces to spread around crops.</p>
<p>But is there a better way to deal with the plant waste? A company in Uganda says yes. The business is collecting banana stems to process the plant tissue and make products.</p>
<p>The idea is both new and <strong>sustainable </strong>in the East African country where banana plants are very important. Uganda has the highest rate of banana use in the world. The country is Africa's top banana crop producer.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A farmer cuts down a banana plant, at her farm, in Kiwenda village, Busukuma, Wakiso District, Uganda, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/6bdd153e-f4c7-4397-9947-3543b2ee9fa2_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A farmer cuts down a banana plant, at her farm, in Kiwenda village, Busukuma, Wakiso District, Uganda, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)</span></div>
<p>A young local business, TEXFAD, deals with the banana plant waste. Now, it says it is making a profit from all the <strong>rotting</strong> stems. TEXFAD collects some of the plant tissue and uses it to make products like floor coverings, containers for home goods and more.</p>
<p>John Baptist Okello leads the business division of TEXFAD. He told the Associated Press that the business made sense in a country where farmers "are struggling" with millions of tons of banana-related waste.</p>
<p>The company works with seven different farmers' groups in western Uganda. It pays $2.70 for a kilogram of dried fiber.</p>
<p>David Bangirana is the leader of one such group in Sheema District. He said only a small part of the stem is used for fiber. He said that the rest of the crushed plant remains is returned to the farmer for use as fertilizer.</p>
<p>TEXFAD also takes material from a third party, Tupande Holdings Ltd. Its trucks transport banana stems from farmers in central Uganda. Tupande's workers search the stems for the best candidates as fiber. Machines then turn the fiber into threads, thin long pieces of cloth.</p>
<p>Aggrey Muganga is the team leader at Tupande Holdings Ltd. He said his company deals with more than 60 farmers who continuously supply surplus raw material.</p>
<p>That number is only a small part of what is available in a country where banana crops makes up more than a million hectares of land.</p>
<p>Banana production has been increasing over the years. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics found that banana production rose from 6.5 metric tons in 2018 to 8.3 metric tons in 2019.</p>
<p>Muganga said that they put extra income in the hands of the farmers. He added, "We turn this waste into something valuable that we sell to our partners who also make things."</p>
<p>At a plant just outside the Ugandan capital Kampala, TEXFAD employs more than 30 people who use their hands to make products from banana fiber. The company is now exporting some products to Europe.</p>
<p>Such products are possible because "banana fiber can be softened to the level of cotton," Okello said.</p>
<p>The company can make some paper products with the material. It is working with researchers to experiment with possible cloth from banana fiber. However, it does not have the technology to make clothing, Okello said.</p>

<p>Canadian universities are confirming the safety of their Indian students and providing resources after a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused the Indian government of being involved in the killing of an Indian separatist leader in Canada. India deplores the accusation.</p>
<p>As Canadian colleges prepare to open classes, some students are considering delaying their studies. Others are wondering whether higher education could be damaged in the current crisis.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People walk on the grounds of the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada September 9, 2020.

<p>India by far supplies the most students to Canada's fast-growing international education business. About 40 percent of study permit holders are from India. International students provide over $14.6 billion to the Canadian economy each year.</p>
<p>Estimates by professionals in India show that over 100,000 students are preparing for an English language test and organizing financing to study in Canada next year.</p>
<p>Top universities offer programs costing up to $29,000 a year. Colleges provide short-term, less costly programs. They are connecting with students to confirm the diplomatic disagreement does not damage one of Canada's better-known exports.</p>
<p>Reporters from Reuters news agency spoke to numerous universities and professionals in Canada and India who said they were taking measures to reduce students' questions or fears.</p>
<p>Joseph Wong is vice president of the University of Toronto. He said the university has reached out to many partners in India to confirm they are committed to continuing cooperation. The University of Toronto had more than 2,400 international students from India in 2022-2023.</p>
<p>Canadian universities say the diplomatic disagreement may only be temporary. But Ashok Kumar Bhatia, President of the Association of Consultants for Overseas Studies, said many Indian students have become concerned about their safety.</p>
<p>Companies like IDP Education have been sending video messages in an effort to calm nerves.</p>
<p>John Tibbits is president of Conestoga College in Ontario. He noted about a hundred students out of the thousands that register every year were asking about delaying their study. Some current students were also seeking to attend classes online.</p>
<p>"Our biggest concern is the <strong>uncertainty</strong>. What might the Indian government do as far as visas and how might people react," Tibbits said. "We are spending $36 million a year for college on just support for students."</p>
<p>International education has seen strong growth in recent years, helping the industry become one of Canada's biggest exports. Education tops auto parts, building materials and airplanes.</p>
<p>York University's President Rhonda Lenton was in India when news of the dispute broke. She said she is sure the two governments will be able to eventually resolve the situation.</p>
<p>But in the Indian state of Punjab, families and hopeful students are worried. An estimated 25 percent of families in the state have a member studying or preparing to study in Canada. Over 5,000 students from one city in Punjab moved to Canada last year.</p>
<p>Taxi-driver Jiwan Sharma is considering whether his son should complete his recent travel plans to Canada.</p>
<p>"I have put my lifelong savings worth over 250 million rupees ($4 million) for sending our son to Canada, hoping he would settle there, and help us in old age."</p>
<p>Tensions do not seem to be decreasing. After a report that India's government asked Canada to withdraw 41 diplomats, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said Canada wants private talks with India to resolve the diplomatic dispute.</p>
<p>Gurbakhshish Singh, a student in Punjab, told Reuters he is sad that India's relationship with a welcoming country like Canada has worsened.</p>
<p>"The government has put our future in <strong>jeopardy</strong>," the student said.</p>

<p>On today's program, let's talk about flowers; but not just any flowers -- roses.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love a beautiful, sweet-smelling rose? The ancient Greeks and Romans connected roses with Aphrodite and Venus, the goddess of love. In modern times, you give a red rose to your true love and a yellow one to your true friend.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Paola Orsero of Alassio, Italy smells a rose at the Royal Horticultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show in London, Britain May 19, 2015.

<p>But roses also have a bad side -- thorns.</p>
<p>A thorn is the very sharp part of some woody plants, like blackberry bushes and roses. A <strong>prick</strong> from a thorn is painful and can cause you to bleed. So, a rose has both beauty and pain.</p>
<p>That is where the saying <u>every rose has its thorns</u> comes from. It means that rarely is something completely good. Even a very pleasant thing, event, or situation can have a bad or unpleasant side. You also could say, <u>there's no rose without a thorn</u>.</p>
<p>Actually, there are some kinds of roses without thorns. But let's not <strong>go down that garden path</strong> and just stay with our expression for today.</p>
<p>Now, here is an example of how to use the expression, <u>every rose has its thorns</u>.</p>
<p>Let's say you were on a game show and won a new car and a trip to Mexico. You are very excited but then find out that you must pay taxes on all the winnings. As you get ready to pay the big tax bill, you could say: "Well, <u>every rose has its thorns</u>."</p>
<p>"Thorn" has another meaning. It can also be something or someone that bothers you. A<u> thorn in your side</u> is a small problem, not a serious one. After all, thorns cause pain, but they are not going to kill you.</p>
<p>A friend who always borrows money from you could become <u>a thorn in your side</u>. She is <strong>annoying</strong> but not a serious problem. But what if her money troubles led to bigger problems for her?</p>
<p>Let's say she cannot pay her bills, and she is in danger of losing her home. In that situation, we can say she has made for herself <u>a bed of thorns</u>. This expression describes a painful, difficult, or unpleasant situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if she finds a way to make a lot of money, and she can pay off her <strong>debt</strong>, we can say she is now <u>sleeping in a bed of roses</u>. That is a really pleasant place to be.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, we use <u>a bed of roses</u> in a <strong>negative</strong> form to describe an unpleasant situation, like in this example:</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, how's everything going? A couple of months ago you told me you were struggling to pay your bills. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I was totally <strong>broke</strong>. I had no money at all.</em></p>
<p><em>A: That sounds really stressful. </em></p>
<p><em>A: It was <u>no bed of roses</u>; I can tell you that! I can't tell you how happy I am to be out of debt!</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. We hope that your English studies have not become <u>a thorn in your side</u>. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Harry S. Truman. He became president of the United States in 1945, a few weeks before the end of World War II in Europe.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Harry Truman" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/756acee7-2ebb-4ed7-ad98-eb9bb6412e04_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Harry Truman</span></div>
<p>Truman took office after Franklin Roosevelt died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Roosevelt had been president for 12 years. But Truman was new to the position of vice president. Two other men had earlier served in the office under Roosevelt.</p>
<p>On April 12, 1945 – less than three months after he became vice president – Truman was called to the White House. There, Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor, told Truman about her husband's death. Truman was quickly <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/harry-trumans-long-day-on-april-12-1945/">sworn-in as president</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after the ceremony, the secretary of war privately told Truman about a secret project involving American scientists. They were building an extremely destructive atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Historians debate whether Truman already knew about the project, or whether the information was a complete surprise.</p>
<p>In either case, the new president had to decide whether to use the weapon, which he called "the most terrible bomb in the history of the world."</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Harry Truman came from simple beginnings. He was born in the state of Missouri. He, his parents, a brother and a sister lived in the town of Independence.</p>
<p>As a boy, Harry Truman helped his father on the family's farm, but he did not enjoy the work. And he could not play sports because he could not see very well; from the time he was a child, Truman wore eyeglasses.</p>
<p>So he developed his interests in reading and music. He was an especially good piano player.</p>
<p>Truman was also a good student, but his parents did not have enough money to send him to a four-year college.</p>
<p>Instead, Truman worked in a number of jobs, including as a bank clerk, mining company operator, and partner in an oil business.</p>
<p>When the United States became involved in World War I, Truman decided to re-join the National Guard. His guard unit became part of the U.S. Army, and Truman earned a position as a captain.</p>
<p>Truman experienced real success in the military. He was an able soldier and leader, and he and his troops fought in battle. When the war ended, Truman kept both the feeling of<strong> self-confidence</strong> and the friendships with the other solders he had formed.</p>
<p>One of Truman's first acts after the war was to get married. He married a woman from his hometown. They had been <strong>romantically</strong> linked for a long time. Her name was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/besstruman">Elizabeth Wallace</a>, but she was called Bess. The Trumans remained happily married for more than 50 years and had a daughter named Mary Margaret.</p>
<p>In the first years after the war, Harry Truman opened a men's clothing shop with a friend from the military. But the shop – called a <strong>haberdashery</strong> -- eventually failed.</p>
<p>Truman soon found a new line of work. An operative from the Democratic Party asked Truman to be a candidate for a position as a judge.</p>
<p>Truman won the seat, as well as a public <strong>reputation</strong> for being an honest, effective public servant.</p>
<p>In time, Truman successfully won election to a seat in the U.S. Senate. For the most part, he earned a good public image there, too. He supported the social programs of President Roosevelt, and he tried to prevent big businesses or large labor unions from misusing public money.</p>
<p>Both voters and Democratic officials liked Truman enough to accept him as the party's vice presidential candidate in 1944. Truman performed well as a candidate, but he did not have a close relationship with Roosevelt or play much of a part in his government.</p>
<p>Yet in a few weeks, following Roosevelt's death, Truman was leading the country.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Truman faced a number of difficult decisions during his two terms as president. Many of them involved foreign policy. His actions helped shape the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>In his first months after taking office, Truman watched the end of World War II in Europe.</p>
<p>He then had to decide how to deal with the war in the Pacific. Japan did not want to accept the Allied forces' demand for total surrender. And Truman did not want to extend the war.</p>
<p>So he approved using the atomic bomb on Japan. Truman directed the secretary of war to drop the weapon on military targets and try to reduce civilian deaths. But the destruction was still terrible.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/06/world/asia/btn-atomic-bombs/index.html">An estimated</a> 192,000 people died in the attack or the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima. Most of the city was destroyed.</p>
<p>Three days later, the U.S. military dropped another atomic bomb, this time on the city of Nagasaki. More than 70,000 people died instantly.</p>
<p>The emperor of Japan called the weapon "a new and most cruel bomb." He agreed to his country's surrender on August 14, 1945. World War II came to an end.</p>
<p>Truman and his government quickly had to make other decisions about how to react to the new international situation. One of the most pressing concerns was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet officials sought to expand their influence around the country's borders, especially in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Iran. Truman and other U.S. officials believed those moves threatened American interests. The United States supported democracy and capitalism. It did not want the Soviet Union's form of communism to spread.</p>
<p>So Truman's government put in place two measures to answer the Soviet Union's influence.</p>
<p>One was a policy known as the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/truman-doctrine">Truman Doctrine</a>. It promised American support to Greece, Turkey and other democratic nations against <strong>authoritarian</strong> forces. The measure was a new step for the United States. In the past, the country had tried to avoid conflicts that did not directly involve it.</p>
<p>Under Truman, the U.S. government was committed to helping "free peoples" anywhere by improving their living conditions.</p>
<p>A second measure came to be called the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan">Marshall Plan</a>, after Truman's secretary of state, George Marshall. Marshall wanted the United States to invest a large amount of money in rebuilding Europe after World War II. Because the Soviet Union controlled much of Eastern Europe, the money eventually went to improving the market economy of Western Europe.</p>
<p>The office of the historian at the State Department notes that one effect of the Marshall Plan was to <strong>introduce</strong> foreign aid programs as an official part of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>Truman also sought to guarantee peace and contain communism in other ways. He supported the United Nations, which was officially launched during his presidency.</p>
<p>And he negotiated a military alliance among Western, democratic nations. The group became known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.</p>
<p>Military alliances became especially important in 1950 when communist forces in North Korea invaded South Korea. The U.N. agreed to send troops to help South Korea -- although many of the troops were American, and they were led by an <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/topics/douglas-macarthur">American general</a>.</p>
<p>Fighting in the <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war">Korean War </a>lasted until 1953. As many as 5 million people died in the conflict. Neither side gained much territory.</p>
<p>But the Korean War had other effects. It fueled the Cold War between communist and democratic forces. It showed the U.S. would really defend other countries against authoritarian forces. It sharply increased Americans' spending on the defense industry.</p>
<p>And it helped make President Truman very unpopular.</p>
<p>Many Americans believed Truman was losing the battle against communism. During his presidency, the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear weapon, and China officially became a communist country under Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Some U.S. lawmakers even accused Truman's government of protecting communist spies. Senator Joseph McCarthy was the most famous of these critics. He launched investigations against thousands of U.S. government employees, as well as movie actors and directors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>McCarthy did not have evidence that these people were secretly working for the Soviet Union. But his campaign helped fuel the public's concerns over communism, a fear that came to be called the Red Scare.</p>
<p>Truman grew tired of the accusations, as well as other political battles. He decided not to seek re-election in 1952.</p>
<p>Instead, he retired with his wife to their home in Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>At first, many Americans had mixed emotions about Truman's presidency. For the most part, they did not support the Korean War. And they remained suspicious that his government had included communist supporters.</p>
<p>But Truman's public reputation rose over time. He became known as a down-to-earth person who would and could fight if needed. His supporters liked to say, "Give ‘em Hell, Harry."</p>
<p>Truman is also remembered for taking some steps toward ensuring equal rights for all Americans. Truman supported the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=84">racial <strong>desegregation </strong>of the military</a> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=29">banned racial discrimination in the civil service</a>.</p>
<p>But Truman is probably best remembered for the difficult decisions he made during his presidency, especially the one to drop atomic bombs on Japan. To the end of his life, he accepted responsibility for the decision and did not apologize for it.</p>
<p>Truman died of natural causes at the age of 88. His remains are buried at his presidential library in Independence, Missouri.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The Mona Lisa is the famous Leonardo da Vinci painting of a woman with a mysterious smile.<br/>
《蒙娜丽莎》是列奥纳多·达·芬奇的名画，画中的女人带着神秘的微笑。</p>
<p>This week, the painting gave up a secret.<br/>
本周，这幅画泄露了一个秘密。</p>
<p>Scientists used X-rays to examine the chemical structure of an extremely small part of the more than 500-year-old painting. The researchers discovered a technique Leonardo used in the work.<br/>
科学家们用X射线检查了这幅有500多年历史的画作中一个极小部分的化学结构。研究人员发现了达·芬奇在这副作品中使用的一种技术。</p>
<p>A team in France and Britain discovered an oil paint used for the Mona Lisa was a special, new chemical mixture.<br/>
法国和英国的一个研究小组发现，蒙娜丽莎使用的油画颜料是一种特殊的新型化学混合物。</p>
<p>The research was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. It suggests that the Italian artist may have been in an experimental mood when he set to work on the painting early in the 16th century.<br/>
这项研究于周三发表在《美国化学学会杂志》上。研究表明，这位意大利艺术家在16世纪初开始创作这幅画时，可能一直处于实验状态。</p>
<p>"He was someone who loved to experiment, and each of his paintings is completely different technically," said Victor Gonzalez. He is the study's lead writer and a chemist at France's top research organization, the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). Gonzalez has studied the chemical makeup of several works by Leonardo, Rembrandt and other artists.<br/>
维克多·冈萨雷斯说：“达·芬奇是一个喜欢实验的人，他的每幅画在技术层面上都是完全不同的。”冈萨雷斯是这项研究的主要作者，也是法国顶级研究机构国家科学研究中心的化学家。冈萨雷斯研究了达·芬奇、伦勃朗和其他艺术家的几件作品的化学成分。</p>
<p>"In this case, it's interesting to see that indeed there is a specific technique for the ground layer of Mona Lisa," he said in an interview with The Associated Press.<br/>
他在接受美联社采访时说：“在这种情况下，很有趣的是，《蒙娜丽莎》的画作底层确实使用了特殊的技术。”</p>
<p> Specifically, the researchers found a rare compound, plumbonacrite, in Leonardo's first layer of paint. The discovery, Gonzalez said, confirmed that da Vinci most likely used lead oxide to thicken and help dry his paint.<br/>
具体来说，研究人员在达·芬奇画作的第一层油漆中发现了一种罕见的铅化合物。冈萨雷斯说，这一发现证实了达·芬奇很可能使用氧化铅来增稠和帮助颜料干燥。</p>
<p>Carmen Bambach, a specialist in Italian art at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, called the research "very exciting." Bambach, who was not involved in the study, said it shows "Leonardo's spirit of passionate and constant experimentation as a painter," she wrote in an email.<br/>
纽约大都会艺术博物馆的意大利艺术专家卡门·班巴赫称这项研究“非常令人兴奋”。班巴赫没有参与这项研究，她在一封电子邮件中写道，这表明了“达·芬奇作为一名画家充满激情和不断实验的精神”。</p>
<p>The speck of paint in the imaging study is about the thickness of a human hair. It lies in the top right area of the painting.<br/>
成像研究中的油漆斑点大约有一根头发的厚度。它位于画作的右上角。</p>
<p>The scientists looked into its atomic structure using X-rays in a synchrotron. The machine moves particles at close to the speed of light, permitting researchers to look deeper into the paint structure.<br/>
科学家们利用同步加速器中的X射线研究了它的原子结构。该机器以接近光速的速度移动颗粒，使研究人员能够更深入地观察油漆结构。</p>
<p>"Plumbonacrite is really a fingerprint of his recipe," Gonzalez said. "It's the first time we can actually chemically confirm it."<br/>
冈萨雷斯说：“铅化合物确实是他配方中的特征，这是我们第一次真正用化学方法确认它。”</p>
<p>Dutch artist Rembrandt may have used a similar mixture when he was painting in the 17th century. Gonzalez and other researchers have found plumbonacrite in his work, too.<br/>
荷兰艺术家伦勃朗在17世纪绘画时可能使用了类似的混合物。冈萨雷斯和其他研究人员也在他的作品中发现了铅化合物。</p>
<p>"It tells us also that those recipes were passed on for centuries," Gonzalez said. "It was a very good recipe."<br/>
冈萨雷斯说：“它还告诉我们，这些配方已经流传了几个世纪，这是一种非常好的配方。”</p>
<p>Leonardo is thought to have melted lead oxide powder, which has an orange color, in linseed or walnut oil to make it thicker and dry faster.<br/>
达·芬奇被认为将橙色的氧化铅粉末融化在亚麻籽或核桃油中，使其更粘稠、干燥更快。</p>
<p>"What you will obtain is an oil that has a very nice golden color," Gonzalez said. "It flows more like honey."<br/>
冈萨雷斯说：“你会得到一种非常漂亮的金色的油，它流动起来更像蜂蜜。”</p>
<p>But the Mona Lisa — said by the Louvre to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant — and additional works by Leonardo still have other secrets to tell.<br/>
但是，《蒙娜丽莎》和达·芬奇的其他作品还有其他秘密要讲，卢浮宫称《蒙娜丽莎》是佛罗伦萨一位丝绸商人的妻子丽莎·格拉迪尼的肖像。</p>
<p>"There are plenty, plenty more things to discover," Gonzalez said. "What we are saying is just a little brick more in the knowledge."<br/>
冈萨雷斯说：“还有很多很多东西等待被发现，我们所说的只是这些知识里的一小部分。”</p>

<p>The largest Hindu religious site outside India in modern times opens to the public Monday in the American state of New Jersey. Its creators began planning the BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Artisans and volunteers spent 4.7 million hours <strong>carving </strong>by hand the temple's two million cubic feet of rock. The rock material includes marble from Italy and limestone from Bulgaria. The material was sent to India for the carving work.</p>
<p>Then, the finished pieces arrived in New Jersey. Workers fitted them together in the city of Robbinsville to build the temple. The building stands on a 51-hectare property.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Monks walk in front of the BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham, the largest Hindu temple outside India in the modern era, on Oct. 4, 2023, in Robbinsville, N.J.

(AP Photo/Luis Andres Henao)</span></div>
<p>The largest Hindu temple in the world is in Cambodia. The Ankgor Wat was built in the 12th century during the Khmer Empire.</p>
<p>It is now described as a Hindu-Buddhist temple, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
<p>The Robbinsville temple is one of many built by BAPS, a worldwide religious and civic organization within the Swaminarayan <strong>sect</strong> of Hinduism.</p>
<p>The organization has built two other Akshardhams, or houses of the <strong>divine</strong>. One is in the capital of New Delhi and the other is in the Gujarat state, where BAPS is based. The sect operates more than 1,200 temples and 3,850 centers around the world. It will celebrate its 50th year in North America next year.</p>
<p>BAPS faced criticism in recent years after workers launched a legal action against the group in 2021. The action accused BAPS of carrying out policies including forced labor, low wages and bad working conditions.</p>
<p>Twelve of the 19 plaintiffs have now withdrawn their accusations and the legal action is suspended while an investigation continues.</p>
<p>The legal action claimed that Dalits, or members of the lowest caste in India, were being abused. Caste is an ancient system of social standing based on ancestry.</p>
<p>Yogi Trivedi is an expert on Hinduism at Columbia University, and a member of the religion. He said these accusations weighed heavily on community members because their religion has always taught them "to see the divine in all..."</p>
<p>"Caste and class do not divide us," Trivedi said.</p>
<p>He said the temple would not have been possible without the service of thousands of volunteers. Many of them took time off school and work to serve in different areas. This might be the first Hindu temple where women were involved in building it, Trivedi added.</p>
<p>This week, families from across the country, have been going to the site to see it from the outside.</p>
<p>Nikita Patel and her husband were among the volunteers who gave their time to create the temple.</p>
<p>"All religions, all communities are welcome here," she said, "And here, they will feel the peace."</p>
<p>Trivedi holds a similar opinion. To him, the temple stands for universal values that can be found in writings and ideas of all religions.</p>
<p>"It's not even just Indian or Indian American," Trivedi said. "What we've tried to do is express these universal values in a way that relate to all visitors."</p>

<p>I happened to find a question that I'm confused about. When I was <strong>surfing </strong>the web, I found "historic" and "historical" are both adjectives. Are there any differences between them? Can you explain how to use them? Thanks.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p><strong><em>Albert, China </em></strong></p>
<p>Dear Albert,</p>
<p>This is an interesting question. The differences between these two words have grown over the years not based on their grammatical form, but on how people have used them. So, let's start by taking a look at what the Merriam-Webster online dictionary says about the ways people use the words.</p>
<p><strong>Historic</strong></p>
<p>The word "historic" is used for important and famous events in history. Here are two examples of that use.</p>
<p><em>The weather reporter warned of a big storm coming that will be of historic <strong>proportions</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you come to Washington, D.C. and be part of this historic event?</em></p>
<p>In these two examples, we see "historic" used for a storm and for a gathering. The word "historic" might also appear when people talk about sports.</p>
<p>You can also see the word used to describe places. In the United States, we have an organization that has information on important places, for example, the home of a former president. Here is a statement using that phrase, "historic places<em>."</em></p>
<p><em>That home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</em></p>
<p>And many local organizations fix up old buildings that are part of their town's history. This process is called "historic preservation."</p>
<p><em>In this neighborhood, homeowners care a lot about historic preservation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Historical </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to the word "historical," we find it used to describe history, as in "the<em> </em>historical record<em>."</em> It appears more often than the word "historic" and also appears with words like <strong>perspective</strong>, literature, and <strong>analysis</strong>. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><em>Historical evidence suggests wolves are both man's best friend and his worst enemy.</em></p>
<p><em>Isabel Allende wrote many works of historical fiction.</em></p>
<p>To sum up, if the thing itself is important or famous, you would probably use "historic"<em> </em>with it. If the thing you are talking about relates to history, something real in the past, use the word "historical."<em> </em></p>
<p>I hope this clarifies the use of these two words for you, Albert. And that's <em>Ask a Teacher</em> for this week. Do you have a question for the teacher? Write to us at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com">learningenglish@voanews.com</a>.</p>

<p>"Look what you...made me do," entertainer Taylor Swift wrote on social media as she <strong>premiered</strong> <em>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</em> movie Wednesday night in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>In the music business, a tour is a series of live shows held in many cities.</p>
<p>The pop superstar announced, "We're opening up early access showings of The Eras Tour Concert Film on THURSDAY in America and Canada!!"</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Taylor Swift arrives at the world premiere of the concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023, at AMC The Grove 14 in Los Angeles.

<p>The film of Swift's live performances was first planned to open on Friday. It is expected to launch with $100 million in <strong>ticket</strong> sales for the opening weekend. But early ticket sales worldwide have already been estimated to reach $140 million.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainers</strong> have released films of live performances for many years. The Korean group BTS released its <strong>concert</strong> film earlier this year. Last month, the rock band Talking Heads released such a movie after many years away from the industry.</p>
<p>But this movie release from Swift is unusual.</p>
<p>Greg Marcus is the chief executive of Marcus Corporation which runs a group of movie theaters in the United States. "This is different," Marcus said. "Take your phone out. Take <strong>selfies</strong>. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere."</p>
<p>Unlike many Hollywood productions, <em>The Eras Tour</em> movie does not need any outside advertising. Swift produced the film herself and informed her 274 million followers on Instagram.</p>
<p>The film will play in movie theaters for at least 13 weeks. Adult tickets are being sold for $19.89. That is higher than the average movie ticket price but several thousand less than some tickets to see Swift live.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, Swift arrived at an AMC Theatre in Los Angeles. She took pictures with fans at the premiere.</p>
<p>Inside the theater, Swift thanked fans for supporting the Eras Tour, which organizers say sold all available tickets for large <strong>stadium</strong> performances around the world. "I've never had this much fun in my life as I had at the Eras Tour," she said.</p>
<p>Swift is returning to the ongoing Eras Tour next month with live performances planned in Argentina and Brazil. After that, the tour will head to Japan, Australia, Singapore and several countries in Europe.</p>

            <title>US Marines Slow to Combine Women, Men in Training  (2023/10/13)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gena Bennett</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">12 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>The U.S. Marines have officially begun combining men and women during their first major training exercises called boot camp. But so far, military leaders appear to be moving slowly to fully join the two sexes together during all training activities.</p>
<p>Reporters from the Associated Press recently visited a Marine Corps base in South Carolina that combines male and female boot camp training. They observed the training exercises and spoke with leaders about the Marines' current policy.</p>
<p>During intense heat at Marine Base Parris Island, two young <strong>recruits</strong> were battling inside a training space. Circling them, a training commander shouted orders, "Hit her! Punch her! DO something!"</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A group of U.S. Marine Corps recruits wait inline before swim training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot pool, Wednesday, June 28, 2023, in Parris Island, S.C. (AP Photo/Stephen B.

(AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton)</span></div>
<p>Outside the space were a mix of male and female Marine hopefuls. The recruits are appointed to one of the mixed-sex companies, or large military groups. The Marine Corps is moving slowly— and at times unwillingly— to combine training women and men at boot camp, the Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Sometimes the joint training has been successful. Other times not.</p>
<p>In the training space, men and women are together while completing timed physical exercises or practicing firing guns. But the line of recruits around the swimming pool outside presents the opposite. There, companies are broken up into smaller groups called platoons. The platoons remain separated by sex. As the recruits line up, there is a small group of women standing at the front with groups of men behind them.</p>
<p>The boot camp training methods suggest Marine Corps leaders still intensely believe there must be some separation in training.</p>
<p><strong>Marine deactivated training unit</strong></p>
<p>It has been nearly eight years since the defense secretary at the time ordered all fighting-related jobs open to women. But the Marine Corps just deactivated a training unit at Parris Island this summer. The unit was created in 1986 to accept women.</p>
<p>Many Marine Corps officers forcefully defend the training separation. Some leaders have strongly expressed the belief that women can grow more <strong>confident</strong> quickly if they are not directly competing with often larger or stronger males.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Congress, the Marines Corps changed the unit for women into a mixed-sex group in recent years. It then officially deactivated it in June. The remaining recruit companies are either mixed-sex or all male.</p>
<p>Inside the pool, men and women struggle side by side, jumping into the water and swimming to the other end. Boot camp trainers are also a mix of men and women. They stand on the edge of the pool ready to throw a float or jump in if needed.</p>
<p>But outside, an all-male group of recruits moves through the woods. The individuals drop to move forward on their hands and knees across a stretch of burning hot sand. A second group training outside also includes no women.</p>
<p>General Walker Field, who leads Marine Base Parris Island, told the AP he believes keeping the platoons separated by sex is an important part of forming successful Marines.</p>
<p>Field explained that the Marine Corps has established proven training methods over the years. Part of this process involves breaking down recruits and then building them back up as successful team members. Field argued that the platoon model is especially important to that success.</p>
<p>Field said keeping platoons all male or female permits leaders to provide exactly what is needed for each group when they are together in the evenings. He added that being the same sex at the platoon level also makes it easier for leaders to make the best training decisions at all times.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Aixa Dones is one female Marine officer who strongly supports a continued separation. Dones served as the last commander of Parris Island's women-only unit before it was deactivated this year. She was also a recruit there and says about the experience, "I can't imagine it having gone any other way."</p>
<p>Sergeant Maria Torres is a training commander. She told the AP she thinks combining companies is a necessary, first step. But expanding it to the platoon level might have poor results, so "we'd have to start small," Torres added.</p>
<p><strong>Many disagree</strong></p>
<p>But many people disagree. They say keeping platoons separate only reinforces the idea that women are not considered equal and should be treated differently.</p>
<p>Erin Kirk is a former Marine sergeant who went through the separated training in 2010. She remembers how male recruits looked down on women in the unit, with some even criticizing the females and calling them names. The split, she said, divided them into "male Marines" and "female Marines." She believes that shaped how the men saw the women. It made it more difficult for them to work together as they moved along.</p>
<p>"It made you feel like you weren't part of the team. It made it difficult to be seen as a real Marine," said Kirk, who served for five years. She believes mixed-sex platoons would be a good way for women to be seen as equals and not as "other" recruits.</p>
<p>When asked about those issues, Lieutenant Dones disagreed that the separation presents problems for women. "Our female platoons have been outperforming our male teams, and we have had more female company honor graduates than we have had male," she said.</p>
<p>Some young female recruits spoke to the AP about the current recruitment process.</p>
<p>Nicole Momura said she chose to join the Marine Corps because she thought it was the hardest military branch. "This recruit was looking for something bigger than herself," the 22-year-old added. Momura is not concerned about the platoon separation, saying, "We're all going to be working together in <strong>the fleet</strong>."</p>
<p>Another recruit, 19-year-old Nubia Delatorre, said she is <strong>proud</strong> to be a member of the second female platoon in her company. But she admits the men and women do not interact very much. She said the females are not permitted to talk to the males.</p>
<p>However, Delatorre said she believes women and men get the same training. In her case, she said she decided to join the Marines because she wanted "to prove to myself that I could do something hard."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The problem of cross-country smoke, or haze, has caused a new disagreement in Southeast Asia.<br/>
跨国雾霾问题在东南亚引起了新的分歧。</p>
<p>Malaysia's environment minister wrote to Indonesia's government this week calling for action to help reduce smoke across Malaysia.<br/>
马来西亚环境部长本周致信印尼政府，呼吁采取行动帮助减少马来西亚各地的雾霾。</p>
<p>The letter comes just weeks after countries in Southeast Asia agreed to a haze-free area by 2030.<br/>
就在发出这封信的几周前，东南亚国家同意在2030年前建立一个无雾霾区。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is going on?<br/>
发生了什么事？</span></p>
<p>In recent weeks, air quality reports in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia have reached readings above 150. This puts conditions at a level where people can experience unhealthy effects. And those with existing health problems could suffer greater greater health problems.<br/>
最近几周，马来西亚和印度尼西亚部分地区的空气质量报告的读数已达到150以上。这将使人们面临不健康影响。而那些存在健康问题的人可能会遭受更严重的健康问题。</p>
<p>On the Indonesian side of Borneo Island, visibility was reduced to less than 10 meters. Schools are closed in both Indonesia and Malaysia to reduce the health effects on young children.<br/>
在印尼一侧的婆罗洲岛，能见度降低到不足10米。印度尼西亚和马来西亚的学校都停课以减少对幼儿健康的影响。</p>
<p>Malaysia has blamed the haze on Indonesia, saying smoke from forest fires is being pushed across the border.<br/>
马来西亚将雾霾归咎于印尼，称森林大火产生的雾霾正被吹向边境。</p>
<p>Every few years, during the dry season, smoke from "slash and burn" land clearing takes over much of the area. Slash and burn is a method in agriculture to cut down and burn plants to clear land for planting.<br/>
每隔几年，在旱季，“刀耕火种”清理土地产生的雾霾就会占据该地区的大部分地区。“刀耕火种”是农业中砍伐和焚烧植物以清理土地进行种植的一种方法。</p>
<p>This method is used to clear land for planting palm trees. Products from palm trees include oil, pulp, and paper. But this method threatens public health, education, and businesses like tourism.<br/>
这种方法用于清理土地种植棕榈树。棕榈树的产品包括油、纸浆和纸张。但这种方法威胁到公共卫生、教育和旅游业等行业。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How are officials dealing with the problem?<br/>
官员们是如何处理这个问题的？</span></p>
<p>Even after Malaysia called on Indonesia this week to avoid "normalizing" the haze, Indonesian officials have denied any responsibility.<br/>
即使在马来西亚本周呼吁印尼避免雾霾“正常化”之后，印尼官员也否认对此负有任何责任。</p>
<p>Indonesia's environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said recently that forest fires had decreased and no haze was found moving toward any neighboring country.<br/>
印尼环境部长西蒂·努尔巴亚最近表示，森林火灾已经减少，没有发现雾霾向任何邻国移动。</p>
<p>She said Indonesia has been dealing with the fires by dropping water bombs from helicopters.<br/>
她说，印尼一直在通过直升机投掷水弹来应对火灾。</p>
<p>In the past, Indonesia has taken legal action against companies suspected of illegal burning. But each year fires continue with different degrees of severity.<br/>
过去，印度尼西亚曾对涉嫌非法焚烧的公司采取法律行动。但每年火灾都会以不同严重程度继续发生。</p>
<p>In 2015 and 2019, Indonesia saw large fires that burned millions of hectares of land. It caused record-breaking pollution and some places were surrounded by toxic yellow smoke.<br/>
2015年和2019年，印尼发生了大火，烧毁了数百万公顷的土地。它造成了破纪录的污染，一些地方被有毒的黄色雾霾包围。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why does this keep happening?<br/>
为什么这种情况不断发生？</span></p>
<p>Under Indonesian law, burning by small, local farmers is permitted. But it must happen on an area no greater than two hectares and necessary prevention measures must be in place.<br/>
根据印尼法律，允许当地小农户焚烧。但它必须发生在不超过两公顷的地区，并且必须采取必要的预防措施。</p>
<p>All large farm holders must follow sustainable palm oil standards, which do not permit burning.<br/>
所有大型农场经营者都必须遵守可持续的棕榈油标准，不允许焚烧。</p>
<p>The rules mean that slash and burn methods continue to be used by small-holder farmers. Additionally, following the guidelines is voluntary.<br/>
这些规定意味着小农户继续使用刀耕火种的方法。此外，遵循指导方针是自愿的。</p>
<p>Unclear supply chains, land claims, and laws mean that large companies can sometimes avoid responsibility for illegal land clearing. The large operations are sometimes owned by companies based in countries like Malaysia and Singapore.<br/>
不明确的供应链、土地主张和法律意味着大公司有时可以逃避非法清理土地的责任。这些大型业务有时由马来西亚和新加坡等国的公司所有。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How is the area responding?<br/>
该地区的反应如何？</span></p>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) recently launched a center for Transboundary Haze Pollution Control (known as ACC THPC).<br/>
东南亚国家联盟（东盟）最近成立了一个跨境雾霾污染控制中心。</p>
<p>Its aim is to help members prevent, deal with, and follow cross-country haze. The center is in line with ASEAN's agreement to reach a haze-free area by 2030.<br/>
其目的是帮助成员国预防、处理和跟踪跨境雾霾。该中心符合东盟关于到2030年实现无雾霾区的协议。</p>
<p>This week ASEAN agriculture and forestry ministers also agreed to take collective action to reduce and eventually remove crop burning.<br/>
本周，东盟农业和林业部长也同意采取集体行动，减少并最终消除焚烧作物的现象。</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">12 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>The war between Israel and Hamas has drawn a lot of international attention this week. News reports, videos, and social media posts have informed people about the latest events in the conflict.</p>
<p>What kinds of language do reporters, journalists, or even citizens use during these conflicts?</p>
<p>That will be the subject of this week's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-5185-08dbca9364be_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar </span></div>
<p><strong>International conflicts </strong></p>
<p>Conflict is not a happy subject. But learning how to understand the language surrounding such events is important.</p>
<p>When we look at the language used to describe conflicts, verbs have special importance. Violent conflicts are about actions – one group doing something to another group. Verbs are the words we use to describe actions.</p>
<p>We can break apart the verbs into two general groups: active and passive forms.</p>
<p>When we say the term active verb, we mean the relationship between the verb and the subject of the sentence. We call a verb an active verb when the subject of the sentence performs the action. Consider this example:</p>
<p><em>Tom kicked the ball.</em></p>
<p>In the sentence, the subject, Tom, does the action – kicking. The action is done to the object – the ball.</p>
<p>In other words, we have this structure: subject – verb – object.</p>
<p>Passive verbs tell us when something is done to someone or something. In other words, the subject is being acted upon. The subject is not acting.</p>
<p>We make a verb passive by introducing the <strong>auxiliary verb</strong> "be," putting the verb in its <strong>past participial</strong> form, and sometimes by introducing a <strong>prepositional phrase</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's take an example.</p>
<p>Here is our active sentence:</p>
<p><em>Tom kicked the ball.</em></p>
<p>A passive sentence might be this:</p>
<p><em>The ball was kicked by Tom.</em></p>
<p>So far, we have explored active and passive verbs at the sentence level. But the same ideas hold true at the level of a clause as well. A clause has a subject and a <strong>predicate</strong>. When a clause stands on its own, we say it is a sentence. But sometimes two or more clauses make up a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter? </strong></p>
<p>So, why are these ideas important?</p>
<p>The language surrounding international conflicts often contains a mixture of active and passive structures. Some reports or social media posts might contain a little more of the passive voice or a little more of the active voice. But most reports will have some kind of mix.</p>
<p>Let's explore one example from the Voice of America.</p>
<p>Linda Gradstein describes some events in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Here is some information about events in Gaza:</p>
<p><em>Palestinian health officials said several dozen Palestinians including women and children were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Jabaliya refugee camp Monday in Gaza. </em></p>
<p>In our example, we have an active form (health officials said....) as well as a passive form (were killed).</p>
<p>The same idea – the mixing of active and passive forms – holds true in many other places in the report.</p>
<p>For example, here is some information about events in Israel.</p>
<p><em>The bodies of more than 260 young music festival goers were discovered Sunday. Hamas gunman kidnapped more than 130 Israelis – many from the festival – and took them to Gaza. </em></p>
<p><strong>Homework </strong></p>
<p>Let's use this final example for a homework assignment. You just heard a mixture of active and passive structures. Can you identify the active and passive forms?</p>

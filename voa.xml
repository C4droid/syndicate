        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Large Study Details Years of Brain Changes in Alzheimer’s Patients  (2024/2/28)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>A long-term study in China has shown that a series of changes take place in the brains of people who get Alzheimer's disease long before they present signs of the sickness.</p>
<p>The large study followed middle-aged and older adults for 20 years. The individuals were examined on a regular basis during that period. The researchers used brain imaging, spinal fluid checks and other tools to collect data.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that the study subjects who later developed Alzheimer's showed high levels of disease-linked protein in their spinal fluid. The higher levels were recorded as much as 18 years before the patients were identified as having Alzheimer's.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A closeup of a human brain affected by Alzheimer's disease, is displayed at the Museum of Neuroanatomy at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, in 2003.

<p>Then every few years, the study <strong>detected</strong> another so-called biomarker of coming trouble.</p>
<p>Scientists still do not know exactly how Alzheimer's forms. The disease slowly destroys the brain, interfering with the ability to think. Alzheimer's patients develop proteins called beta-amyloid and tau, which over time build up into <strong>plaques</strong> that block brain processes.</p>
<p>The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers a timeline for how these proteins develop.</p>
<p>The study's importance "cannot be overstated," said Dr. Richard Mayeux, an Alzheimer's specialist at Columbia University who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>"Knowledge of the timing of these <strong>physiological</strong> events is critical" for testing new ways of treating and maybe even preventing Alzheimer's, he wrote in a piece published alongside the study report.</p>
<p>Scientists already knew that in rare, genetic forms of Alzheimer's that affect young people, a poisonous form of amyloid starts developing about 20 years ahead of symptoms. At some point after that, tau develops as well.</p>
<p>The new findings show the order of such biomarker changes common to age-related Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Researchers with Beijing's Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders compared 648 people who were later found with Alzheimer's to an equal number who remained healthy. The amyloid finding in future Alzheimer's patients was the main discovery.</p>
<p>Differences in tau were found next, followed by a marker of trouble in how neurons communicate. A few years after that, the study found differences in brain shrinkage and <strong>cognitive</strong> test scores between the two groups.</p>
<p>"The more we know about <strong>viable</strong> Alzheimer's treatment targets and when to address them, the better and faster we will be able to develop new <strong>therapies</strong> and preventions," said Claire Sexton, director of scientific programs with the Alzheimer's Association. She noted that blood tests are coming soon that promise to also help by making it easier to find amyloid and tau.</p>
<p>More than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. There is no cure.</p>
<p>But last year, Leqembi became the first approved drug that could slow the worsening of early Alzheimer's for a few months. The drug works by clearing away some of the amyloid protein. Other drugs are being developed to target tau.</p>

            <title>Schools Want More Therapy for Students, Not All Parents Agree  (2024/2/28)</title>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>

<p>Derry Oliver was in fifth <strong>grade</strong> when she first talked to her mother about seeing a <strong>therapist</strong>.</p>
<p>They were moving to New York City. Derry had to live with family members in another state while her mother, also named Derry Oliver, found a job and <strong>apartment</strong>. (In this story, we will call the daughter by her first name, Derry, and her mother by her family name, Oliver.)</p>
<p>It was a difficult year. A school worker suggested therapy. Derry's mother questioned the advice and disagreed with therapy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Derry Oliver, 17, right, hugs her mother, also Derry Oliver, during a visit to a playground near home, Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, in New York.

<p>"You're so young. There's nothing wrong with you. These are <strong>growing pains</strong>," Oliver told her daughter.</p>
<p>However, Derry's depression got worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. She struggled with the loneliness of at-home learning. She reached out to her high school for help.</p>
<p>In New York, school-based mental health professionals like social workers can provide some <strong>counseling</strong> without parental permission. But therapy requires a parent's agreement.</p>
<p>"It was very emotional for both of us because I understood her <strong>frustrations</strong> and fears," Derry remembered. "But at the same time, it's sometimes best for your child to be able to <strong>access</strong> this rather than hold it away from them."</p>
<p><strong>Difficulties in getting therapy</strong></p>
<p>Using federal money from the pandemic, schools around the U.S. have employed more mental health specialists. They also add telehealth and online counseling to reach as many students as possible.</p>
<p>As treatments have become more readily available and more young people talk openly about mental health issues, schools are now facing difficulties in getting parents to agree to treatment.</p>
<p>Chelsea Trout is studying social work at New York University and is doing her training at a school in Brooklyn. She called it a "disconnect" between parents and children.</p>
<p>"The kids are all on TikTok or the internet and understand therapy-speak and that this is something that could be helpful for their mental health and are interested in...," said Trout. But she added that they may not have support from their parents.</p>
<p>Politics can also play a part. Some states are looking to make getting therapy without parental permission easier while others are proposing more restrictions.</p>
<p>The states of California and Colorado have recently lowered the age of consent for treatment to 12. But in some states like North Carolina, the issue is part of larger political debates on the input parents can have on school teachings as well as the rights of <strong>transgender</strong> students.</p>
<p>Cost is another issue. Therapy is rarely free. And paying for it often requires parental support.</p>
<p><strong>Parental support</strong></p>
<p>Research suggests that the need for parental permission can keep young people from getting treatment.</p>
<p>Jessica Chock-Goldman is a social worker at Bard Early College High School in New York City. She said that she has seen many cases where mental health issues turn severe partly because young people did not get earlier access to therapy.</p>
<p>For Derry and her mother, years of talking have led to some progress. Several years ago, her mother agreed to a compromise.</p>
<p>They found a Black female therapist, which was important to both of them as a Black family. Oliver agreed that her daughter could start therapy — as long as she could sit in on the meetings.</p>
<p>"It has to be someone trustworthy," Oliver said of a possible therapist for her daughter. But the therapist changed jobs after a month and Derry has not seen another therapist since.</p>
<p>Trout, the school social worker in training, said she has met many parents who, like Oliver, have trust issues.</p>
<p>"If we're thinking about <strong>predominantly</strong> Black and brown communities, if your interactions with social workers or mental health services or anything in that <strong>realm</strong> thus far have not been <strong>positive</strong>," Trout said, "how could you trust them with your kids?"</p>
<p><strong>Racial divide</strong></p>
<p>Statistics also show a racial divide.</p>
<p>In 2021, 14 percent of white children reported seeing a therapist at some point during that year. This number is compared to 9 percent of Black children, 8 percent of Hispanic children, and 3 percent of Asian American children. These numbers come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Without access to therapy, Derry has sought advice about dealing with her emotions through friends, school social workers, and the Internet. But she feels that she could gain more with professional help.</p>
<p>Derry has already gotten into several colleges. One thing she is considering is what the school offers for therapy.</p>

            <title>In Japan, Fewer Births, Marriages a Cause for Concern  (2024/2/28) | 日本低出生率和低结婚率成隐患</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The number of babies born in Japan last year fell to a new low for an eighth straight year, government data shows. In addition, the number of marriages continues to drop.<br/>
政府数据显示，去年日本出生人口数量连续第八年降至新低。此外，结婚人数继续下降。</p>
<p>The Health and Welfare Ministry reported Tuesday that 758,631 babies were born in Japan in 2023. That represented a 5.1 percent decline from the year earlier. It was the lowest number of births since Japan started recording the statistics in 1899.<br/>
日本厚生福利省周二报告称，2023年日本共有758631名婴儿出生。这比去年同期下降了5.1%。这是自1899年日本开始统计以来出生人口最低的一次。</p>
<p>The number of marriages fell by 5.9 percent to 489,281 couples, falling below a half-million for the first time in 90 years. Fewer marriages are one of the reasons for fewer births. Having children outside of marriage is rare in the East Asian country.<br/>
结婚人数下降了5.9%，降至489281对，近90年来首次降至50万对以下。结婚人数减少也是出生人数减少的原因之一。在东亚国家，婚外生子的情况很少见。</p>
<p>Opinion studies show that many younger Japanese do not want to marry or have families. They note the lack of good jobs and high cost of living as reasons. Some say the working culture in Japanese businesses makes it hard for both parents to work. Young parents say they often feel isolated as people do not want to hear crying babies or children playing outside.<br/>
民意调查显示，许多日本年轻人不想结婚或成家。他们指出原因是没有好工作以及生活成本高昂。有人说，日本企业的工作文化让父母双方都感觉工作艰难。年轻的父母说，他们经常感到被孤立，因为人们不想听到婴儿哭声或孩子在外面打闹。</p>
<p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the ongoing declining birth rate "critical." He said, "The period over the next six years or so until (the) 2030s, when the younger population will start declining rapidly, will be the last chance we may be able to reverse the trend."<br/>
日本内阁官房长官林芳正称持续下降的出生率“非常严重”。他说，“在未来六年左右的时间里，直到21世纪30年代，年轻人口将开始迅速下降，这将是我们扭转这一趋势的最后机会。”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the low birth numbers "the biggest crisis Japan faces." He has introduced several measures to give financial support for childbirth, children, and their families.<br/>
日本首相岸田文雄称低出生率是“日本面临的最大危机”。他推出了几项措施，为分娩、儿童及其家庭提供经济支持。</p>
<p>But experts say they doubt whether the government's efforts will work because they have largely centered on people who already are married or are planning to have children. The measures do not deal with a growing population of young people who are not getting married or planning to have a family.<br/>
但专家称他们怀疑政府的措施是否有效，因为这些措施主要集中在已经结婚或计划生育的人身上。这些措施并没有针对越来越多的没有结婚或计划组建家庭的年轻人。</p>
<p>The number of births in Japan has been falling for 50 years after a peak of about 2.1 million. The decrease to a yearly number below 760,000 has happened faster than expected. Experts had predicted that it would take place by 2035.<br/>
日本出生人口在达到210万左右的峰值后，近50年来一直在下降。出生人口下降到每年76万以下的速度远超预期。专家们曾预测这个数字将在2035年出现。</p>
<p>Japan's population of more than 125 million is expected to drop to 87 million by 2070, with four out of every 10 people at age 65 or older.<br/>
日本超过1.25亿的人口预计将在2070年降至8700万，并且其中每10人就有4人年龄在65岁或以上。</p>
<p>A shrinking and aging population has a big effect on the economy and national security. Recently, Japan lost its spot as the world's third-largest economy, falling behind Germany.<br/>
人口的萎缩和老龄化对经济和国家安全有很大影响。最近，日本失去了世界第三大经济体的地位，掉到了德国后面。</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>This year, 2024, is a leap year. February 29 is known as "leap day." But what is behind this rare extra day on the <strong>calendar</strong>?</p>
<p>Everyone knows the Earth takes 365 days to travel around the sun. Well, that is not exactly correct. The Earth really takes 365 days, five hours, forty-eight minutes and forty-six seconds to complete its orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>So, almost every four years an extra day occurs and it is represented on the calendar.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photograph taken in Paris on February 26, 2024, shows the tear-off calendar page for the February 29 leap year 2024. (Photo by Martin BUREAU / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fbe34def-6f14-4896-8362-df0ef2dba2d8_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This photograph taken in Paris on February 26, 2024, shows the tear-off calendar page for the February 29 leap year 2024. (Photo by Martin BUREAU / AFP)</span></div>
<p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology says the extra day is used to be sure the months stay connected to yearly events such as <strong>equinoxes</strong> and <strong>solstices</strong>.</p>
<p>NASA says that over time, our seasons would fall out of order without the leap day. Each calendar year is about six hours longer than 365 days.</p>
<p>However, a leap day is not added every four years. That would lengthen the calendar by 44 minutes, say experts at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Over time, that would mean summer would arrive in November, said Younas Khan, a physics instructor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.</p>
<p>So a leap day is added nearly every four years, but not in years including 1700, 1800 and 1900. There was a leap day in 2000 because it was a year divisible by both 100 and 400. Over the next 500 years, there will be no leap day in 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500.</p>
<p>There will be leap days in 2028, 2032 and 2036.</p>
<p>Without a leap day, farmers might have trouble planting in the correct season, Khan said. "Christmas would be in summer. There will be no snow. There will be no feeling of Christmas," he said.</p>
<p>You might wonder who came up with the idea of leap day. Experts say the calendar change developed over time.</p>
<p>Ancient civilizations planned their years based on either the moon or the sun. By the time Julius Caesar controlled the Roman Empire, things had gotten more complicated. People had written down the calendars but seasons were "<strong>drifting</strong>." For example, the weather in July was not always the same. So in that time, they added months to the calendar. But that did not really fix the problem.</p>
<p>The Romans fixed the problem in the year 46 BCE. The year became 365-and-one-fourth days long. So an extra day was added every four years. The Romans came close, but a year is actually 365 plus 0.242 days, says Nick Eakes, an astronomy professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>There have been multiple calendars used by western societies. The Athenian and the Julian calendars were used thousands of years ago. The Athenian calendar, however, ran into problems when holidays were not falling in the correct seasons, said Thomas Palaima, a <strong>classics</strong> professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Over time, the current calendar also changed because of holidays. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Gregory XIII, fixed the calendar again in the late 1500s. He wanted to be sure the Christian holiday of Easter happened in early spring. So Gregory and his advisors did the difficult math to come up with something very close to the calendar we use today.</p>
<p>"If the solar year was a perfect 365.25 then we wouldn't have to worry about the tricky math involved," said Eakes, the astronomy professor.</p>
<p><strong>Special birthdays</strong></p>
<p>After the calendar, the main concern for leap day centers on those born on that day, February 29. It only comes around once every four years (for the most part.)</p>
<p>It is a conversation starter for many. It can be an administrative headache – some people must fill out official documents and say their birthday is either February 28 or March 1. Some computer systems have not yet been updated to include February 29 as a choice.</p>
<p>Only about 5 million of the 8 billion people worldwide were born on February 29. Shelly Dean of Seattle, Washington is one of them. Growing up, she said, she had normal birthday parties each year, but every fourth year, she had a special party.</p>
<p>She is now 23, but has not had too many "special" birthdays. So this year, she is planning one. She missed celebrating with her family four years ago, because she was attending school in New York. So on Thursday, she gets to celebrate her special day for the first time in eight years with her family.</p>
<p>"It's a very big day," she said.</p>

            <title>South Korea Warns Striking Doctors to Return or Face Punishment  (2024/2/27) | 韩国警告罢工医生返岗否则面临处罚</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>South Korea's government has warned young doctors to return to work before February 29 or face possible punishments.<br/>
韩国政府警告年轻医生在2月29日之前返回工作岗位，否则可能面临惩罚。</p>
<p>About 9,000 young doctors started walking off the job early last week to protest a government plan to increase the number of students accepted to medical schools.<br/>
上周早些时候，约9000名年轻医生开始离职，以抗议政府扩大医学生招生人数的计划。</p>
<p>The doctors are in the early part of their careers. They are known as residents or interns. These young professionals generally assist or observe more experienced doctors in their work.<br/>
这些医生正处于职业生涯的早期阶段。他们被称为住院医生或实习生。这些年轻的专业人员通常在工作中协助或观察更有经验的医生。</p>
<p>The government wants to expand the yearly number of new medical student admissions by 2,000. The plan also offers incentives to doctors if they specialize in areas facing shortages, such as doctors who treat children or work in emergency rooms.<br/>
政府希望将每年新招收的医学生人数增加2000人。该计划还为专门从事面临短缺领域的医生提供激励，例如在儿科或急诊室工作的医生。</p>
<p>Officials have said the plan is necessary to serve South Korea's aging population. The country's current doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the developed world.<br/>
官员们表示，这项计划是服务韩国老龄化人口所必需的。该国目前的医患比例是发达国家中最低的。</p>
<p>But the striking doctors say the nation's universities are unprepared to deal with additional students. They have also said the change would not solve doctor shortages in some areas of the profession.<br/>
但罢工的医生们表示，韩国的大学没有做好应对新增学生的准备。他们还表示，这一改变不会解决该行业某些领域的医生短缺问题。</p>
<p>
Under South Korean law, the government can order doctors and other medical workers back to work if there is a major risk to public health. Refusal to obey such an order can result in the suspension of licenses and up to three years in prison or a $22,480 fine. Those who receive prison sentences would have their medical licenses canceled.<br/>
根据韩国法律，如果公众健康面临重大风险，政府可以命令医生和其他医务工作者重返工作岗位。拒绝遵守此类命令可能导致执照被吊销、最高三年监禁或22480美元罚款。那些被判入狱的人士将被吊销行医执照。</p>
<p>South Korea's Vice Health Minister, Park Min-soo, told reporters Monday the government would not seek any punishments against striking doctors who returned by February 29. "If they return to the hospitals they had left by then, we won't hold them responsible" for any damage caused, Park said. He added, "It's not too late. Please, return to patients immediately."<br/>
韩国保健福祉部副部长朴敏守星期一告诉记者，政府不会寻求对2月29日前返岗的罢工医生施加任何惩罚。朴敏守说，“如果他们回到当时离开的医院，我们不会对他们造成的任何损失的追究责任。”他补充道：“现在还不算太晚。请立即回到病人身边。”</p>
<p>The government said those who do not return to work by the end of the month could be punished with at least a three-month suspension of their medical licenses. Doctors who continue to strike could also face additional legal steps and possible court trials.<br/>
政府表示，月底之前没有返岗的人士可能会被处以吊销医疗执照至少三个月的处罚。继续罢工的医生还可能面临额外的法律措施和可能的法庭审判。</p>
<p>Hyeondeok Choi is a partner at the law firm Daeryun, which specializes in medical law. He told the Associated Press it would be highly unlikely the government would suspend the licenses of all striking doctors because of the possible harm that could cause. Some industry observers said a more likely action would be for the government to only punish strike leaders.<br/>
崔德贤是Daeyun律师事务所的合伙人，他专攻医疗法。他告诉美联社，政府极不可能因为可能造成的伤害而暂停所有罢工医生的执照。一些行业观察人士表示，政府更可能采取的行动是只惩罚罢工领头人。</p>
<p>The AP reports there are about 13,000 medical interns and residents working in South Korea. These workers represent about 30 to 40 percent of all the doctors at some major hospitals.<br/>
据美联社报道，韩国约有13000名实习医生和住院医生。这些人员在一些大医院约占所有医生人数的30%到40%。</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the government announced it would permit universities to admit 2,000 more medical students starting next year. Officials say the plan calls for adding up to 10,000 new doctors by 2035.<br/>
本月早些时候，政府宣布将允许大学从明年开始多招收2000名医学生。官员们表示，该计划要求到2035年新增1万名医生。</p>
<p>Public opinion studies have shown that about 80 percent of South Koreans support the government's plan. But striking doctors have said they worry that doctors facing increased competition could start treating patients for conditions they do not have. This, they added, could put new financial pressures on the country's medical system, which would have to pay for the additional costs.<br/>
民意调查显示，大约80%的韩国人支持政府的计划。但罢工医生表示，他们担心医生面临日益激烈竞争，可能会开始对患者进行过度治疗。他们补充道，这可能会给该国的医疗系统带来新的财政压力，该系统将不得不支付额外的费用。</p>
<p>Critics have noted doctors currently receive one of the highest pay rates of any workers in South Korea. They argue that increasing numbers creates greater competition and can lower doctor incomes.<br/>
批评人士指出，目前医生的工资是韩国所有职工中最高的。他们认为，人数的增加会带来更大的竞争，并可能降低医生的收入。</p>
<p>Vice Health Minister Park said the country's services for emergency and critical patients remain stable. He noted that public hospitals had extended their working hours and military hospitals were opening their emergency rooms to civilian patients.<br/>
韩国保健福祉部副部长朴表示，韩国的急诊和危重症患者服务保持稳定。他指出，公立医院延长了工作时间，同时军队医院向平民患者开放了急诊室。</p>

<p>A brain wasting disease called frontotemporal dementia has gained attention after television and film personalities said they suffered from it.</p>
<p>In a statement, caregivers said doctors told talk show <strong>host</strong> Wendy Williams that she had the unusual form of dementia. It said Williams had undergone many medical tests to identify the condition. Actor Bruce Willis is also reportedly affected by the condition.</p>
<p><strong>What is frontotemporal dementia?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - TV talk show host Wendy Williams attends a ceremony honoring her with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Los Angeles.

<p>Frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, is a rare disease that affects parts of the brain controlling behavior and language. These parts of the brain shrink as the disease gets worse.</p>
<p>FTD usually can affect people in their 40s through their early 60s. It can change a person's <strong>personality</strong>, causing a loss of control or wild behavior. It is sometimes mistaken for mental health disorders like depression or bipolar disorder. It can take years for doctors to <strong>diagnose</strong> the condition.</p>
<p>Brenda Rapp is a scientist at Johns Hopkins University. Rapp described signs of the disease this way: "Maybe you're doing things that are <strong>bothering</strong> people and you don't really understand why they're bothering people."</p>
<p>The disease is linked to primary progressive aphasia, which is a condition affecting a person's ability to communicate. A person with this sort of FTD may have trouble finding words or understanding speech.</p>
<p><strong>What causes FTD?</strong></p>
<p>Damage to neurons, the brain's information carriers, is believed to be part of the problem but the root reasons for a case are often unclear. People with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop it. But most people with FTD have no family history of dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Can FTD be treated?</strong></p>
<p>There is no cure for FTD, but there are different ways to try to deal with it. People might get speech <strong>therapy</strong> if they have the kind that affects language. They might get physical therapy to improve movement.</p>
<p>Some patients receive antidepressants or drugs for Parkinson's, a nervous system disease, which has some of the same <strong>symptoms</strong> as FTD.</p>
<p><strong>How fast does FTD progress?</strong></p>
<p>FTD can be a long illness, lasting two to 10 years. People with FTD will need caregiving or nursing support as their symptoms get worse.</p>
<p>"The disease will spread throughout the brain," Rapp said. "The rate at which it does that is extremely unpredictable. So, it's very hard to know...how quickly someone will <strong>deteriorate</strong>."</p>
<p>The financial costs for a family can be high. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that it costs $10,000 a year, on average, in the United States for health and long-term care for a person with dementia.</p>

            <title>US Approves Asthma Drug to Treat Food Allergies  (2024/2/27)</title>

<span class="datetime">26 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>The U.S. food and drug agency has approved a medication already used to treat the breathing condition <strong>asthma</strong> to treat people for food <strong>allergies</strong>.</p>
<p>On February 16, the United States Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) approved Xolair for a new use. Xolair has become the first medication approved by the FDA to reduce allergic reactions caused by food allergies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The U.S. food and drug agency has approved a medication already used to treat the breathing condition asthma to treat people for food allergies." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2cbd0bb7-8bfc-4e5b-aa40-c71aea270fba_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The U.S. food and drug agency has approved a medication already used to treat the breathing condition asthma to treat people for food allergies.</span></div>
<p>Xolair is the brand name, or <strong>commercial</strong> name, for the drug omalizumab.</p>
<p>Many people who suffer from allergies — and their families —worry about <strong>exposure</strong> to things that cause allergic reactions. They might avoid eating at restaurants. They also might avoid social situations in which they might come into contact with something that causes their allergy.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Wood is director of the pediatric allergy division at Johns Hopkins Children's Center. The FDA based its decision on research that Wood led. And the National Institutes of Health supported the allergy study.</p>
<p>One hundred sixty-eight people with allergies to peanuts and at least two other foods took part in the study. It found that 68 percent of the people injected with Xolair were able to have about 600 milligrams of peanut protein without serious problems. That number compares to only six percent of those who received an inactive substance instead of the drug.</p>
<p>The results of the study were similar for other allergens, or things that commonly cause allergies, such as tree nuts, milk, eggs, and wheat. Full results from the study are expected to be presented at a meeting and released in a <strong>peer-reviewed</strong> publication in the near future.</p>
<p>Wood said: "To have this protection is going to be life changing."</p>
<p>Wood estimated that 25 to 50 percent of people with food allergies, especially children and young adults, would choose to use Xolair.</p>
<p>Patients as young as one year of age with food allergies can take the drug by injection<strong> </strong>every two to four weeks. This depends on their weight and their body's response to allergens.</p>
<p>People who use Xolair must continue to avoid the foods that cause allergic reactions. These foods are often peanuts, cashews, hazelnuts, walnuts, milk products, and eggs. However, the medication appears to permit exposure to higher amounts of allergy-causing foods without causing major reactions.</p>
<p>Until now, doctors have used the drug to treat food allergies although that has not been its officially approved use, said Dr. Ruchi Gupta. Such a second use for a drug is called "off-label." Gupta is director of the Center for Food Allergy &amp; Asthma Research at Northwestern University in Chicago. She welcomed full approval of the product.</p>
<p>Xolair works by blocking the body's natural response to allergens. It is known as a monoclonal antibody. The FDA first approved the drug in 2003. It is used to treat asthma, growths in the nose, and long-term skin problems known as chronic hives.</p>
<p>Swiss drug companies Novartis and Roche produce Xolair, and it is <strong>distributed</strong> by a part of Roche, called Genentech.</p>
<p>The most common side effects<strong> </strong>of Xolair are injection <strong>site</strong> reactions and high body temperatures. However, the FDA noted that the drug has also caused joint pain, <strong>rash</strong>,<strong> </strong>infections, <strong>malignancies,</strong> and abnormal laboratory tests.</p>
<p>Xolair also comes with a warning. The treatment itself can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that causes breathing and blood pressure problems. For that reason, the treatment must be started in a health care center with equipment that can deal with such emergencies. In addition, the drug is not approved as an emergency treatment for allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Genentech says Xolair is expected to cost about $2,900 a month for children and $5,000 a month for adults. The company said patients usually pay less because their health insurance often pays most of the cost of many drugs.</p>

            <title>Experts Say Productivity Increases Might Explain US Economy’s Strength  (2024/2/27)</title>

<p>Worker shortages in the United States have led some companies to invest in machines to do some of the work they cannot find people to do. The companies have also been training workers to use new technology so they can produce more with less.</p>
<p>The result has been an unexpected increase in productivity, a measure of economic performance. Productivity compares two sets of data: outputs and inputs. Outputs are the goods and services produced, while the inputs are what is needed to create those goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity increase</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A worker at Reata Engineering and Machine Works programs a Mazak Variaxis machine used to make semiconductor pieces, Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024, in Englewood, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/95982b90-8b15-4f2c-9e48-e45bb0500758_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A worker at Reata Engineering and Machine Works programs a Mazak Variaxis machine used to make semiconductor pieces, Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024, in Englewood, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)</span></div>
<p>The productivity increase represents a change from the years before the COVID-19 pandemic years. Yearly productivity growth averaged around 1.5 percent, business advisory company RSM estimates.</p>
<p>Things changed when the economy moved out of the 2020 recession. Businesses had difficulties bringing back the many workers they had lost.</p>
<p>The resulting worker shortage sent pay higher. Inflation increased for a number of reasons. One was that factories and ports had problems meeting rising product orders while shipping slowed. Shortages of parts were also reported.</p>
<p>Many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property grew. The Associated Press reports that the efficiency effects began to arrive almost a year ago.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports on productivity. The BLS released its most recent productivity numbers on February 1. The bureau said: "Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023."</p>
<p><strong>One company's story</strong></p>
<p>Batesville Tool &amp; Die is a company based in the Midwestern state of Indiana. Trying to keep up with customer demand, Batesville Tool &amp; Die began looking for 70 people to hire last year. It was not easy. Getting factory workers to move to a small community of 7,300 people in the Indiana countryside was difficult.</p>
<p>Job seekers were rare there.</p>
<p>"You could count on one hand how many people in the town were unemployed," said Jody Fledderman, the company chief.</p>
<p>Batesville Tool &amp; Die filled just 40 of its job openings.</p>
<p>But then the company invested in machines that could work like human workers and in vision systems, which helped its robots "see" what they were doing.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity: not well understood</strong></p>
<p>Austan Goolsbee is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He has compared increasing productivity to "magic...for the economy...You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.''</p>
<p>Joe Brusuelas is chief economist at RSM. He said, "The last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s."</p>
<p>At that time, Brusuelas said, a productivity increase — an early result from the sudden use of laptops, cellphones, and the internet — helped keep borrowing rates low. Inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market were strong.</p>
<p>This time, the U.S. central bank has increased the interest rates it controls 11 times starting in March 2022. That has played a part in easing inflation from a 40-year high of 9.1 percent to around 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>"I would have said it's not possible,'' said Sal Guatieri who is an economist at BMO Capital Markets. "But that's exactly what happened.''</p>
<p>A year ago, many economists warned that a recession was very likely. Jerome Powell leads the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. Powell warned in 2022 that beating inflation would result in "some pain" in the form of widespread job losses and unemployment.</p>
<p>Last month, Powell said something different. With unemployment near a 50-year low, Powell told reporters, "We've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down."</p>
<p>He did warn that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. But the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its two percent goal that it has not raised rates since July. Some experts expect the central bank to cut its interest rates several times this year.</p>
<p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing even while inflation has fallen.</p>
<p>"That's one way to look at it — yeah," Powell replied.</p>

<p>It is one of Earth's loudest sounds in the ocean: the "singing" of whales.</p>
<p>Now scientists think they have an idea of how <strong>baleen</strong> whales do it. They say the large air-breathing sea animals use a special voice box that enables them to make sound underwater.</p>
<p>Scientists say the discovery is based on a very small study. But it will direct future research into how whales communicate.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This photo provided by Samuel Lam shows a humpback whale and her calf in Papeete, French Polynesia in September 2022.

<p>The new findings are in a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07080-1">study published recently</a> in the scientific publication <em>Nature</em>. Coen Elemans of the University of Southern Denmark and other international scientists studied the voice boxes, or larynxes, of three dead whales from the beaches of Denmark and Scotland. The three were humpback, minke and sei whales. All three are part of the family of baleen whales, a group that includes the blue whale, the largest animal that ever existed on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Voice box</strong></p>
<p>In the laboratory, the scientists blew air through the voice boxes under controlled conditions to see what tissues might <strong>vibrate</strong>. They also created computer models of the sei whale's <strong>vocalizations</strong> and matched them to recordings of similar whales taken in the wild.</p>
<p>Whales' ancestors were land animals that moved into the oceans about 50 million years ago. Elemans said the animals' voice box changed over tens of millions of years in order to make sounds underwater.</p>
<p>Baleen whales do not have teeth or vocal cords like humans and other mammals. Instead, they have U-shaped tissue in their voice boxes that permits them to breathe a lot of air very quickly. Their voice boxes also contain a large "<strong>cushion</strong>" of fat and muscle not seen in other animals. Whales "sing" by pushing the tissue against the fat and muscle cushion.</p>
<p>Elemans said baleen whales depend on the production of sound to communicate in the dark of the deep oceans. "For example, humpback females and their <strong>calves</strong> communicate with each other by voice, and humpback males sing to attract females," he added.</p>
<p>Jeremy Goldbogen is a professor of oceans at Stanford University, who was not involved in the research. He said, "This is the most <strong>comprehensive</strong> and <strong>significant</strong> study to date on how baleen whales vocalize, a long-standing mystery in the field."</p>
<p>The whale voice boxes tested were from younger animals, not adult males, who do the singing. Because of that, whale expert Joy Reidenberg said further experiments on adult males are needed to confirm the study's findings.</p>
<p>Reidenberg works for the Center for Anatomy and Functional Morphology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. She noted that the research is probably as close as we can get to reproducing how whales sing.</p>
<p>"Right now, our technology involves sticking a <strong>scope</strong> into a whale to see what exactly is vibrating," she said. "Since you're never going to be able to do that in a wild animal, these experiments are the next best thing."</p>
<p><strong>Shipping noise</strong></p>
<p>As loud as whales' songs are, the study suggests that whales cannot produce sounds louder than noise from the shipping industry, Elemans said.</p>
<p>"They're really affected by (shipping noise) and it significantly reduces their ability to communicate," he said. "There's just no way for them to get louder."</p>
<p>Because some whales sing as a mating call, the shipping industry's interference with those songs is a concern, said Michael Noad. He is director of the Center for Marine Science at the University of Queensland in Australia. He also was not part of the <em>Nature</em> study.</p>
<p>"For whale populations that are really <strong>dispersed</strong>, like the Antarctic blue whales, they might not be able to find mates in a noisy ocean environment," he said. However, whales like humpbacks that gather in big numbers are more likely to ignore such noise pollution.</p>

<p>Astronomers say they may have discovered the brightest object ever observed in the universe.</p>
<p>The discovery involves a distant space object known as a quasar. The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasas-webb-will-use-quasars-to-unlock-the-secrets-of-the-early-universe/">describes</a> quasars as "very bright, distant and active supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun."</p>
<p>A quasar's light "outshines" all other stars and "its jets and winds shape" its galaxy, NASA adds.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration provided by the European Southern Observatory in February 2024, depicts the record-breaking quasar J059-4351. (M. Kornmesser/ESO via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-9c69-08dc33dd2675_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This illustration provided by the European Southern Observatory in February 2024, depicts the record-breaking quasar J059-4351. (M. Kornmesser/ESO via AP)</span></div>
<p>A team led by Australian researchers identified the super bright quasar. The European Southern Observatory's (ESO's) Very Large Telescope, based in northern Chile, collected most of the data. Additional data came from Australia's Siding Spring Observatory.</p>
<p>The researchers estimate the record-breaking quasar is at least 500 trillion times brighter than our own sun. The team also noted the black hole powering the object is more than 17 billion times larger than our sun.</p>
<p>The quasar is about 12 billion light years away from Earth. It is thought to have existed since the early days of the universe. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers.</p>
<p>The object was already known and had been studied before. But scientists say it was misidentified in the past as a star. The newly identified quasar is so large that its black hole could easily swallow at least one sun per day, the team said.</p>
<p>The researchers recently reported their finding <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02195-x">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>
<p>The quasar appears only as a small dot in images. But scientists say they imagine it to be a very powerful and active place. The team says the black hole is thought to have a circulating <strong>disk</strong> containing gas and other matter from swallowed stars. The disk spins continuously like an intense, active storm.</p>
<p>"This quasar is the most violent place that we know in the universe," said the lead writer of the study, Christian Wolf. He is an astronomer and professor in the College of Science at Australian National University.</p>
<p>The ESO first found the object, known as J0529-4351, in 1980. At the time, it was identified, or classified, as a star. Then last year, it was identified as a quasar.</p>
<p>The latest observations and computer modeling suggest the quasar is taking in amounts of material equal to about 370 suns a year, or about one per day. The team says more observations will be needed to fully understand the object's growth rate.</p>
<p>Priyamvada Natarajan is a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University. She was not part of the latest study. But Natarajan told the Associated Press, "The exciting thing about this quasar is that it was hiding in plain sight and was misclassified as a star previously."</p>
<p>Study co-writer Christopher Onken added, "It is a surprise that it has remained unknown until today, when we already know about a million less <strong>impressive</strong> quasars."</p>
<p>The researchers say finding and studying distant supermassive black holes could help astronomers learn important details about the birth and development of the early universe. But study leader Wolf noted that he also gets enjoyment out of the search itself.</p>
<p>"Personally, I simply like the chase," he <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2402/">said</a> in a statement. "For a few minutes a day, I get to feel like a child again, playing treasure hunt. And now, I bring everything to the table that I have learned since."</p>
<p>Future research is expected to center on the history of the quasar and measuring its growth and development. The team noted that some of this data should be easier to collect after the Very Large Telescope receives an instrument <strong>upgrade</strong>. The upgrade, known as Gravity+, is designed to provide more exact measurements of the mass of distant black holes.</p>
<p>In addition, the ESO plans to launch a future observer, called the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), in Chile's Atacama Desert. That telescope, the researchers say, will improve on current identification and study methods to identify such distant objects.</p>

            <title>US Prepares for a Cicada Invasion Last Seen in 1803  (2024/2/26)</title>

<p>Do you remember all those cicada videos from the United States in 2021?</p>
<p>Well, prepare for a repeat performance this year. The insect show begins as early as April.</p>
<p>Two groups of cicadas, <strong>brood </strong>XIII and brood XIX, are expected to come out from the ground to mate and lay eggs this year. Their appearance in the same year is rare. The last time it happened was 1803.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A cicada is seen on a wooden sign on the porch of a house in Arlington, Virginia, May 20, 2021. (REUTERS/Will Dunham)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-81ee-08dc32e4452d_cx0_cy4_cw99_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A cicada is seen on a wooden sign on the porch of a house in Arlington, Virginia, May 20, 2021. (REUTERS/Will Dunham)</span></div>
<p>Brood XIII is on a 17-year cycle. They will be found in the Midwestern states of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Kentucky. Brood XIX is on a 13-year cycle. They will come out in an area stretching from Indiana and Illinois southeast to the southern states of Alabama and Georgia.</p>
<p>Scientists expect more than one trillion cicadas to appear in some small areas where the two broods are close to each other. The insects will begin to climb out of the ground when the soil warms to about 18 degrees Celsius. So they will be seen in warmer southern areas as early as April. It will be closer to summer, sometime in June, before the cicadas arise to the north in Wisconsin, Indiana and other Midwestern states.</p>
<p>Cicadas are large, noisy insects, from about 2.5 to 5 centimeters long. Like most insects, they have wings. They also have big "bulging" eyes. There are thousands of species of cicada around the world.</p>
<p>The huge majority of cicada species arise each year, or annually. Then there are the periodicals which arrive after numerous years in the ground.</p>
<p>The periodical cicadas emerge to mate.</p>
<p>The male cicadas make a <strong>thrumming</strong> sound with their wings on their bodies to call for mating. The "singing" appeals to females. The insects mate and leave their fertilized eggs on trees. The resulting young fall to the ground after breaking out of their shells. They dig down into the ground where they live for years, feeding on the liquid that comes from tree roots.</p>
<p>Seven of the nine known periodical cicadas live in North America. Of the other two groups, one is in India and one is found only on the island country of Fiji.</p>
<p>Floyd Shockley is an insect scientist, or entomologist, with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. He said this year's group of cicadas will include four different Magicada species within the XIX brood.</p>
<p>The next time brood XIX and brood XIII will come out in the same year will be in 2245.</p>

<p>I'm Olena Zamorska and I teach English in Sophia Rusova Lyseum in Oleshnia, Ukraine.</p>
<p>It was early morning, exactly at 4:20 am, when I was awakened from my sleep by the sounds of explosions. My family and I rushed outside and watched with fear. We saw flashes in the sky and heard explosions and sounds of military vehicles. We were only thirty kilometers from the Russian border. That moment changed our lives, because we understood that the war had started.</p>
<p>I did not know what to do. I thought about my work and my students. I was a lead teacher in the eighth grade. I organized a meeting to calm my students. We had to learn to live and work remotely in a new dangerous situation. I gave my students schoolwork through their mobile phones and checked everything by collecting the exercise books. They brought them to the nearest shop. It was the place of meeting and communication at that time.</p>
<p>Our village was in a "grey" zone. Neither Ukrainian nor Russian troops were there. We did not have electricity, internet connection or food. And we could not communicate with people outside.</p>
<p>I rode my bicycle to visit students at their homes and keep in touch with their parents. I was a local authority in the village at that time and people listened to my words. I baked bread in a wood stove and brought it to people in need. People were very grateful because there was not enough food at the time.</p>
<p>Each night we heard and watched Russian airplanes and helicopters bringing bombs to Chernihiv and providing their troops with food and weapons. We believe they flew at night time to frighten and keep people from sleeping. The helicopters flew so low that we could see the pilot. It was very scary. We did not know what would happen next and prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>We organized villagers to defend ourselves. We made bombs and set up blockades with trees. We were ready to fight against our enemies and meet them at our land.</p>
<p>When we did not have electricity and connection, I rode my bicycle for 10 kilometers to stand on a hill and phone our relatives to inform them that we were alive. From that high place, I could use an expensive cell phone connection to try to get a short message across to family in occupied places. It was our only way to contact each other.</p>
<p>When Russian troops finally left Chernihiv, we resumed remote studying for the students. I tried yoga and started breathing exercises with my students. And I studied how to deal with traumas and manage difficult situations.</p>
<p>Nowadays my students and I live a normal life. We help our soldiers by making candles, knitting nets, warm socks, mats, collecting money and painting pictures and writing letters.</p>
<p>We hope our victory will be soon.</p>
<p>I'm Jill Robbins.</p>

<p>Government scientists are aiming to replace <strong>coral</strong> at seven places off the Florida Keys island group. But <em>The Associated Press</em> reports three fourths of the newly <strong>cultivated</strong> coral has died because of warm water temperatures.</p>
<p>The scientists are with the U.S. agency known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. They planted staghorn and elkhorn coral as part of the agency's Mission: Iconic Reefs effort, first announced in 2019. The corals are being grown on structures in shallow water.</p>
<p>The two <strong>species</strong> of coral are considered threatened. The scientists wanted to see how the cultivated species were doing. They visited five places where they had planted coral earlier. They hoped the coral had survived water temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celsius or more during the summer and fall.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows dead elkhorn coral on Feb. 9, 2024, at Carysfort Reef, northeast of Key Largo, Fla.

<span class="imagecaption">This image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows dead elkhorn coral on Feb. 9, 2024, at Carysfort Reef, northeast of Key Largo, Fla. (Ben Edmonds/NOAA via AP)</span></div>
<p>Last summer, students and volunteers tried to rescue the corals by removing them and temporarily putting them in tanks.</p>
<p>But most of the coral did not survive. NOAA said only 22 percent of the 1,500 repopulated staghorn corals that they saw were still alive. Only five percent of 1,000 replanted elkhorn corals were alive. At Looe Key, the southernmost of the reefs they looked at, "we did not find any live elkhorn or staghorn coral, not wild, not planted," said coral biologist Katey Lesneski. She is research and <strong>monitoring</strong> coordinator for NOAA's effort.</p>
<p>"It's really horrible to witness," Lesneski said just two days after the dives to observe coral had finished.</p>
<p>Scientists blame human-caused climate change. They also note that the natural El Nino Pacific Ocean current affects weather in North America. They said these conditions are making the water too warm for the coral. Corals are small animal colonies that build rocky formations as they grow.</p>
<p>"There's still a lot of data to be collected to really understand..." Lesneski said. She added: "But we certainly have not seen something like this in recorded human history."</p>
<p>Staghorn and elkhorn populations are important because they provide a "structural framework" for coral, Lesneski said.</p>
<p>The scientists did see some wild coral alive and well, she said. Brain or boulder corals seemed to be doing better.</p>
<p>The U.S. government and private groups plan to spend at least $97 million to place coral species grown on land or in the ocean in seven places off the Florida Keys the AP reports. Some of the species are native and others have been <strong>crossbred</strong> to be <strong>heartier</strong>, Lesneski said. It is too early to tell which ones are better able to survive.</p>
<p>Lesneski said NOAA measured water temperatures of 34 degrees Celsius at the planting places. Mark Eakin is with the International Coral Reef Society. He said, "They were actually seeing temperatures that they didn't think were possible."</p>
<p>Eakin and the University of Victoria coral biologist Julia Baum said the findings raise concerns about trying to repopulate coral reefs by cultivating coral in very warm water.</p>
<p>Lesneski said she understands that concern and researchers are looking to see what they could do to <strong>breed</strong> more heat-resistant coral.</p>
<p>"But for now, if we want to have...reefs, we do have to do our best to <strong>conserve</strong>, be good <strong>stewards</strong> and restore to the degree we can," she said.</p>

<p>Students must learn <strong>academic</strong> writing and research methods when moving from high school to college. That is why universities require a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/not-all-college-classes-lead-to-degrees-/6996181.html">first-year writing class</a>. As experienced students move on to higher degrees, they continue learning how to do research and to write for academic publications.</p>
<p>But learning the new writing methods can be difficult for international students, said Nat Smitobol. He is a counselor for IvyWise, a company that helps students prepare their applications for top-level American universities.</p>
<p><strong>Different "academic culture"</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="One student believes those working on getting better at writing in English should limit their use of AI tools." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fafacb65-81f4-424c-b386-90e1a9b4b5bc_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">One student believes those working on getting better at writing in English should limit their use of AI tools.</span></div>
<p>In the United States, Smitobol said, most students have a basic understanding that they must give credit to, or <strong>cite</strong>, the <strong>sources</strong> of the words and ideas in their academic writing. For those who come from other countries, this can be new.</p>
<p>Smitobol said one of the most important lessons students new to the U.S. learn is: "this academic culture of really making sure you give other people credit in a formal way."</p>
<p>Using another person's words without giving them credit is considered <strong>plagiarism</strong>. VOA Learning English recently prepared a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/defining-plagiarism-how-to-avoid-it/7451640.html">guide for international students</a> who need to learn more about plagiarism and why it is a serious concern. A plagiarism accusation recently led to Harvard University's president having to step down from her position.</p>
<p>Smitobol said the reason citations are difficult for international students is that teachers and professors overseas are more often concerned that students provide the correct answer to a question than showing the information source.</p>
<p>Amjad Binshahbain agrees. He is a student at the English Language Center, or ELC, at Old Dominion University in Virginia. Binshahbain is from Yemen and also attended school in the United Arab Emirates. In Virginia, he takes classes with students from places like Greece, Spain and Japan. They often discuss the academic differences between the U.S. and their countries.</p>
<p><strong>AI tools</strong></p>
<p>He said one of the first things ELC students learn is how to follow American university guidelines for recording source material. They also talk about writing papers without the help of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, or AI, tools.</p>
<p>Binshahbain said it is easy for students who are learning how to write papers in English to depend on generative AI tools. These tools can change their grammar or make their writing easier to understand. However, after nearly a year at the ELC, he has, in his words, "progressed a lot."</p>
<p>"I have been improving since then, since the summer in 2023. Now I can write a whole <strong>assignment</strong> without any outside source. I can read an <strong>article</strong> and understand it and write it in my own words. That's one of the techniques that I got since I come to the U.S."</p>
<p>He said it is better to struggle with writing and adding citations to academic work early in college than to find out that you do not know how to do it later on.</p>
<p>Smitobol noted that many universities will show students how to use tools such as the RefWorks citation manager. The computer tool permits students to carry out research online and collects all of the source material necessary.</p>
<p><strong>High stakes</strong></p>
<p>Meredith Bricker teaches in the English Language Institute at the University of Michigan. Many of her students are working on advanced degrees. That means they are learning and doing research on difficult academic subjects. She said the citation tools are both good and bad. On the one hand, they permit students to easily create a source list. On the other hand, they can prevent students from finding or understanding the best sources for a project.</p>
<p>"They're like, ‘OK, fine. I'll just put whatever comes up (in my search) on my citation list,'" Bricker said.</p>
<p>Students who come to Bricker's class are doing their own research, she added. They hope that they can make a discovery or create a new idea and be published in a <strong>journal</strong>. So, the <strong>stakes</strong> are high for master's or Ph.D. students compared to those just beginning college. She said it is likely the people cited in a paper by one of her students will read it.</p>
<p>"In some ways it's (citations) more relevant. You know, like, almost easier for them to see the purpose and the point. But I think it's also the <strong>flip side</strong> of that is if they do it incorrectly, it could have such devastating effects on their futures, you know, pretty immediately."</p>
<p>International students who are caught using other people's ideas without citing them can be expelled or removed from school. That would cause them to be in violation of their F1 student visa. At higher levels, a young researcher who is caught plagiarizing may have trouble finding another job.</p>
<p><strong>AI is ‘not going away'</strong></p>
<p>Bricker believes students should also give credit to AI tools whenever they use them. "Gen-AI is not going away," she said. "Part of our job as writing teachers...is to make sure students know the boundary between <strong>appropriate</strong> and inappropriate use."</p>
<p>She said some academic journals will permit the use of artificial intelligence and others will not. "It depends on the field," she said, noting that a linguistics journal might have different rules than an engineering journal.</p>
<p>Bricker said she tells her students that it is difficult for teachers to know if their students are using AI tools. But as a writing teacher, it is her goal to help them learn to write on their own, without help from a machine.</p>
<p>"I'm a teacher of writing. So, letting my students know ‘I want to see your writing, you.' I want to see what you're doing as a writer, and I want to help you grow as a writer...So I can do that with you using this and without you using this. But it's your choice."</p>
<p>Binshahbain said international students who are learning English in the U.S. are tempted by AI tools. But he advises students that they should use AI only for some things, like searching for sources.</p>
<p>"When I first came here, I was using it for everything," he said. "But I stopped because I understand the best thing to do (is) to put the effort on learning. It's going to pay off in the future."</p>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">24 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church has been trying for years to inform the public that its "secret" collection of documents is not secret.</p>
<p>The Vatican has opened documents of World War II-period Pope Pius XII to researchers. It even changed the official name of the <strong>archive</strong> to remove the word "Secret."</p>
<p>Recently the chief of what is now called the Vatican Apostolic Archive, Archbishop Sergio Pagano, spoke to the Associated Press. Pagano told some of the secrets he had uncovered in the 45 years of working in the archive. The Vatican's archive is one of the world's most important stores of documents.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Prefect of the Archivio Apostolico Vaticano, Bishop Sergio Pagano poses in his office at The Vatican, Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2024, after an interview with The Associated Press. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1e1c3433-d3e5-424b-adde-6135d9cedfe6_cx5_cy7_cw86_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Prefect of the Archivio Apostolico Vaticano, Bishop Sergio Pagano poses in his office at The Vatican, Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2024, after an interview with The Associated Press. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)</span></div>
<p>In a new book-length <strong>interview</strong> called "Secretum," Pagano explained some of the largely unknown details of the history of the Vatican and its relations with the outside world over the past 1200 years.</p>
<p>The interviews took place as discussions over a year with Italian reporter Massimo Franco. Pagano explains everything from French leader Napoleon taking documents to the 1922 financial support for the election of a pope from Catholics in the U.S.</p>
<p>"It's the first time and it will also be the last because I'm about to leave," said Pagano who is 75. He also spoke to the AP before his expected retirement later this year.</p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII first opened the archive to researchers in 1881. Until then, it had only been used to serve the pope and <strong>preserve</strong> documentation of the head of the Catholic Church dating from the 8th century.</p>
<p>The archive has 85 kilometers of space for books, much of it underground in a two-story, fireproof secure area. It also holds documents from Vatican embassies around the world and collections from powerful families and religious orders.</p>
<p>The archive works much as any national or private archive would. Researchers request permission to visit and then request documents to study in reading rooms.</p>
<p>Most recently, researchers have been going to the archive to read through the documents of Pope Pius XII. He was the pope who has been criticized for not speaking out against the Holocaust during WWII.</p>
<p>Pope Francis ordered the documents of his office opened earlier than planned, in 2020, so researchers could have a full picture of the papacy.</p>
<p>In the book, Pagano criticizes incomplete research into the process of confirming the <strong>sainthood</strong> of Pius XII. Researchers are now examining newly available documents.</p>
<p>Aside from old stories, "Secretum" also shares new ones. They include an important financial relationship between Catholics in the U.S. and the Vatican that continues today and dates back to 1922.</p>
<p>Pagano said that after Pope Benedict XV died, a financial official found that the Vatican had no money. The book shares secret messages in which the Vatican asked its ambassador in Washington D.C. to send "what you have in the safe" so that the vote for a new pope could take place.</p>
<p>The messages say the Vatican embassy sent $210,400.09 collected from the American Catholics. That permitted the vote to elect Pope Pius XI.</p>
<p>Pagano suggests that Francis' 2019 decision to remove the word "Secret" from the archive's name and rename it the Vatican Apostolic Archive was possibly a choice to gain donations. The U.S.-based group Treasures of History is aiming to support the newly renamed archive.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, Pagano showed visitors one of the archive's prized possessions. It is the 1530 letter from British <strong>nobles</strong> urging Pope Clement VII to permit King Henry VIII to end his marriage, so he could marry Anne Boleyn.</p>
<p>Clement refused. Henry got married anyway. He broke ties with the Catholic Church in Rome and established the Church of England.</p>
<p>"You can say that here we are at the birth of the Anglican Church," Pagano said.</p>
<p>Pagano explained how the document survived. He said when Napoleon Bonaparte, the ruler of France, took documents from the Vatican archives in 1810, the chief archivist at the time hid the letter.</p>
<p>"The French never found it," Pagano said, showing that he believed an archivist's main job is to preserve the archive.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about a way to share ideas, thoughts, and opinions – a bully pulpit. This common two-word noun sounds aggressive. But is it? Let's explore!</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Preachers have pulpits. Presidents have bully pulpits.

</span></div>
<p>We'll start with the word "bully."</p>
<p>Usually when we use the word "bully," we are talking about a person who is cruel or threatening to others.</p>
<p>As a verb, if you bully someone you treat them in a cruel, insulting, or aggressive way. Bullies usually threaten those who are weaker or smaller than them.</p>
<p>Now the word "pulpit." A pulpit is a raised platform used in preaching or conducting a worship service.</p>
<p>So, together a bully pulpit sounds like a preacher who is bullying others. But that is not what it means.</p>
<p>A <u>bully pulpit</u> is a public-facing position – especially a political office. It provides a way to share or spread your ideas widely. If you have a <u>bully pulpit</u> you have a position of influence or power.</p>
<p>Experts say that <u>bully pulpit</u> comes from the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. When he was in office, he once said, "I suppose my critics will call that <strong>preaching</strong>, but I have got such a bully pulpit!"</p>
<p>Roosevelt observed that his time in office at the White House was a <strong>platform</strong> for speaking out for what he believed in. He could influence others. He understood that his presidency was his bully pulpit.</p>
<p>When then President Roosevelt used the term "bully," he meant something excellent or first-rate. This is an older meaning of the word. And these days we often use it an as<strong> interjection</strong>, saying "Bully for you!" to cheer another's success.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear this term used in a short <strong>conversation</strong>.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, what are doing this evening? What to grab a bite?</em></p>
<p><em>B: I wish I could. But I have a <strong>board </strong>meeting for my swimming pool. </em></p>
<p><em>A: I thought you <strong>quit</strong> that board?</em></p>
<p><em>B: I did. But I have to attend one last meeting to hand off my notes to the new secretary. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Why are you quitting? I never heard the full story.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I'm quitting because of the board president. She uses her position as a bully pulpit. Instead of making the pool better, she <strong>lectures</strong> the rest of us on all kinds of issues. </em></p>
<p><em>A: It's a swimming pool? What issues come up?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Oh, you name it! We have to hear her views on everything from recycling to dog parks to the evils of potato chips. Hey, if you have time would like to replace me on the board?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Yeah ... no thanks. </em></p>
<p>While today, bully pulpit is most often used in the world of politics, we can also use it in other areas. The president of a company can use that position as a bully pulpit -- so can the principal of a school, leaders of media sites, interest groups and more.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time ...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A private spacecraft has successfully touched down on the moon, marking the first U.S. lunar landing in more than 50 years.<br/>
一艘私人航天器成功着陆月球，这标志着美国50多年来首次登月。</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA confirmed the Odysseus moon lander, built by Texas company Intuitive Machines, had landed on the moon's surface Thursday.<br/>
美国宇航局证实，由德克萨斯州直觉机器公司建造的奥德修斯月球着陆器已于周四降落在月球表面。</p>
<p>Flight controllers said earlier that difficulties with the lander's navigation equipment had forced them to activate an experimental landing system at the last minute. Officials from Intuitive Machines also reported communication problems but said a signal was received from the lander after a delay.<br/>
飞行控制人员早些时候表示，着陆器导航设备出现的难题迫使他们在最后一刻启动了一个实验着陆系统。直觉机器公司的官员还报告了通信问题，但表示在延迟后收到了来自着陆器的信号。</p>
<p>"What we can confirm, without a doubt, is our equipment is on the surface of the moon," said Intuitive Machines project director Tim Crain. He was speaking to flight controllers at the company's operations center in Houston, Texas.<br/>
直觉机器项目总监蒂姆·克雷恩表示：“我们可以确认的是，毫无疑问，我们的设备在月球表面。”他在该公司位于得克萨斯州休斯顿的运营中心与飞行管制员交谈。</p>
<p>The company's chief, Steve Altemus, added, "I know this was a nail-biter, but we are on the surface, and we are transmitting. Welcome to the moon." In a message published Thursday night on X, Intuitive Machines said flight controllers had "confirmed Odysseus is upright and starting to send data."<br/>
该公司首席执行官斯蒂芬·阿尔特莫斯补充道，“我知道这是一个棘手的问题，但我们（的航天器）在月球表面，我们正在传输数据。欢迎来到月球。”周四晚上直觉机器公司在X上发布的一条消息中表示，飞行控制人员已“确认奥德修斯是直立的，并开始发送数据。”</p>
<p>The spacecraft targeted a landing spot about 300 kilometers from the moon's south pole. The area is mostly flat, but also includes large rocks, hills and craters. Officials from Intuitive Machines were not immediately able to provide details about whether Odysseus had reached its target landing area.<br/>
该航天器瞄准了距离月球南极约300公里的着陆点。该地区大部分平坦，但也包括大型岩石、山丘和火山口。直觉机器公司的官员无法立即提供奥德修斯是否到达目标着陆区的详细信息。</p>
<p>Another U.S. company, Astrobotic Technology, attempted a lunar landing last month. But that privately built lander, called Peregrine, developed a fuel leak shortly after launch and did not make it to the moon.<br/>
另一家美国公司航天机器人技术公司上个月试图登月。但这艘名为“游隼”的私营建造的着陆器在发射后不久就出现了燃料泄漏，未能成功登月。</p>
<p>Officials from Astrobotic were quick to send congratulations to the Odysseus mission team. "An incredible achievement. We can't wait to join you on the lunar surface in the near future," the company wrote on X.<br/>
航天机器人技术公司的官员很快向奥德修斯任务团队表示祝贺。该公司在X上写道：“这是一项令人难以置信的成就。我们迫不及待地想在不久的将来和你们一起登上月球表面。”</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson also reacted on Twitter, writing that Intuitive Machines had "aced the landing of a lifetime."<br/>
美国国家航空航天局局长比尔·纳尔逊也在推特上做出了回应，他写道，直觉机器“取得了终生难遇的成功”。</p>
<p>The last time the United States landed on the moon was in 1972, with NASA's Apollo 17 mission. So far, five nations have successfully landed spacecraft on the moon: the United States, China, the Soviet Union, Japan and India. Japan's landing came just last month.<br/>
美国上一次登月是在1972年，当时是美国宇航局的阿波罗17号任务。到目前为止，已有五个国家成功地将航天器降落在月球上：美国、中国、苏联、日本和印度。日本上个月刚刚着陆成功。</p>
<p>In addition to being the first U.S. lunar landing since 1972, the Odysseus mission marked the first time a privately built spacecraft has touched down on the moon.<br/>
奥德修斯号任务是自1972年以来美国首次登月，也是私营建造的航天器首次登月。</p>
<p>Odysseus is carrying scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several private organizations. Experiments are to include observations of space weather activity and radio waves. The spacecraft is designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the landing area.<br/>
奥德修斯号搭载了美国宇航局和几家私营组织的科学仪器和技术演示。实验将包括对空间天气活动和无线电波的观测。该航天器的设计目的是在着陆区太阳落山之前，利用太阳能运行七天。</p>
<p>NASA has said data from the lunar lander's mission will be used to help prepare for the agency's future Artemis space program. That program aims to return astronauts to the moon. NASA recently announced that its planned mission to land humans on the moon, called Artemis III, was set for September 2026.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，这次月球着陆器任务的数据将用于为该机构未来的阿尔忒弥斯太空计划做准备。该计划旨在让宇航员重返月球。美国宇航局最近宣布，其计划于2026年9月执行其人类登月的“阿耳忒弥斯3号任务”。</p>

            <title>Cuban Biologists Solve Mysteries of Bird Migration  (2024/2/24)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>Researchers from Cuba are working with a Canadian partner to learn more about <strong>migratory</strong> birds that travel between North America and Cuba each year.</p>
<p>Daniela Ventura is a bird biologist at the University of Havana in Cuba. On a recent day, she caught a catbird with a net in the capital city's botanical gardens. The small, gray animal is one of the <strong>species</strong> of migratory birds that fly from the United States and Canada to Cuba each winter.</p>
<p>Ventura calls out observations to her students, who take notes nearby. She describes the species, its weight and its estimated body fat.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="University of Havana professor Daniela Ventura speaks to students at Havana's Botanical Garden, in Havana, Cuba, February 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Norlys Perez)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/771ddfaa-70dd-498b-9de9-fe0ff0439bf8_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">University of Havana professor Daniela Ventura speaks to students at Havana's Botanical Garden, in Havana, Cuba, February 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Norlys Perez)</span></div>
<p>The information provides new data for a joint project between Canada and Cuba. Ventura and the other project researchers hope to learn more about how and where the birds spend their winters in Cuba.</p>
<p>"We know a lot about their <strong>ecology</strong> in the breeding <strong>zone</strong> (in North America) but very little about what happens in their wintering zone," Ventura said.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is politics, said Lourdes Mugica. She is an expert on birds and helped organize the research.</p>
<p>A long-lasting U.S. <strong>embargo</strong> has made cooperation between the United States and Cuba difficult. That includes scientific research.</p>
<p>Migratory birds, of course, are indifferent to the restrictions.</p>
<p>"Birds don't understand embargoes or <strong>geographic</strong> borders, they don't need a visa to enter our country," Mugica said. "I hope there comes a time when relations are normal and that we can have joint projects between (the U.S. and Cuba.)"</p>
<p>Mugica says the project – with partnership from Environment and Climate Change Canada – suggests what is possible. Martin Acosta, another leading bird expert in Cuba, agrees.</p>
<p>The Canadian and Cuban partners put up a radio telemetry <strong>antenna </strong>in Cuba. The antenna operates as part of an international research network called MOTUS. It is the first time Cuba has been included in the MOTUS network.</p>
<p>The antenna can follow birds that have been <strong>radio</strong>-<strong>tagged</strong> in other parts of North America. It recently found in Cuba a small Swainson's thrush. The bird was first tagged in Canada's British Columbia – 5,000 kilometers away from the Caribbean nation.</p>
<p>"We never thought we'd reach the level of sophistication we now enjoy," said Acosta.</p>
<p>"Sophistication" means highly developed and complex.</p>
<p>Both Mugica and Acosta remember the hard days during their careers in science. Mugica said she lost over 30 kilograms doing research many years ago, at a time when food in Cuba was hard to find.</p>
<p>It is still hard to carry out their research some days, they say. Their 20-year-old truck needed a push start on a recent morning, for example.</p>

<p>The polonaise is a traditional Polish dance that was once banned in the country. Now, the United Nations is honoring the dance.</p>
<p>UNESCO stands for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. On December 5, the polonaise entered UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The U.N. organization noted that the dance "<strong>symbolizes</strong> cooperation, <strong>reconciliation</strong>, and equality."</p>
<p>The dance is believed to have started in the 18th century. It has been performed at parties for the rich and powerful and at village celebrations. The polonaise has <strong>inspired</strong> music by <strong>composers</strong> such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Frederic Chopin. And it remains an important part of school and family celebrations.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Dancers of the WARSZAWIANKA ensemble of the University of Warsaw dance Poland's national polonaise dance in 18th century costumes during dress rehearsal in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 8, 2024.

<p>Poland's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage asked for the Polonaise to be included on UNESCO's list. The ministry said its request received huge public support.</p>
<p>"Thousands of people on Facebook and on other social media were supporting the (UNESCO) entry," Joanna Cicha-Kuczynska of the ministry's Department of Monuments Protection, told <em>The Associated Press.</em></p>
<p>She said there is a huge community, including whole families, that dance the polonaise and pass the tradition on.</p>
<p>In the polonaise, a whole group can dance together, explained Marcin Pracki, a dancer of the Warsaw University's Dance Theater.</p>
<p>Another dancer, Monika Fiugajska, said the dance's simplicity is its strength. She added that the polonaise can express emotions in a special way.</p>
<p>The dance developed from a traditional form called the "walking dance." By the 18th century, it had become popular at royal European balls, or dance parties.</p>
<p>The word polonaise is French for "Polish."</p>
<p>Szymon Paczkowski is a musicology professor at the University of Warsaw. He agrees that the dance should be on UNESCO's list. "It is a dance with not only Polish but an international tradition," he said.</p>
<p>In the late 18th century, Russia, Prussia, and Austria divided and controlled Poland for more than 100 years. Russia banned the polonaise in the areas it took over.</p>
<p>During this time, the polonaise became an important connection to Poland for Polish people, especially those in foreign countries. This included Chopin, who left Poland in 1830 and moved to Paris the following year. Today, Chopin's polonaises remain among the most popular pieces for <strong>classical</strong> piano.</p>
<p>In Poland, the polonaise has now become the opening dance at high school pre-graduation balls. After World War II, Poland's communist officials banned it from schools. The officials worried about its connection to Polish patriotism and former rulers.</p>
<p>Nineteen-year-old Gabrysia Kosmal was among the students at one of Warsaw's high schools who performed the polonaise this month. She noted that although there are conflicts between students, when they dance the polonaise, they come together. "It's a magical moment," she said.</p>
<p>The polonaise is regularly performed during national anniversaries, including the November 11 Independence Day. On this day, people are invited to dance in the streets with officials.</p>
<p>Natalia Berna is an 18-year-old student who took part in a large street dance in the central city of Lodz last month. She said the polonaise brings people together at a time when the community needs it. She added that it is important to keep the tradition alive.</p>
<p>The leader of the Lodz street dance, Janusz Wielgosz, said the polonaise is about beauty.</p>
<p>"It is a dance that is really very simple, with beautiful music and beautiful <strong>costumes</strong>. It is worth a try," he said.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Teacher Sahraoui.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>My student answered a question I asked in a written test as follows:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: 'Do' for emphasis" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-db55-08dc32f28daa_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: 'Do' for emphasis</span></div>
<p><em>Yes, consumers do adopt new habits.</em></p>
<p>Shall I consider the answer grammatically incorrect because of the use of auxiliary do, even though the rest of the sentence is ok?</p>
<p>Thanks for answering.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing, Sahraoui. Your question points out an important purpose for "do" in statements.</p>
<p>We know that "do" does many things in English. It can serve as an auxiliary verb in negative statements. For example:</p>
<p><em>I <u>do</u>n't have any money.</em></p>
<p>It can also serve as an auxiliary verb in questions:</p>
<p><em><u>Does</u> Brent have to work on weekends?</em></p>
<p><em>What <u>do</u> you think?</em></p>
<p>Or it can provide a short answer to a yes/no question.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I <u>do</u>.</em></p>
<p><em>No, I <u>do</u>n't.</em></p>
<p>In addition to all that, it can make imperatives, or commands, more polite.</p>
<p><em><u>Do</u> come in.</em></p>
<p>"Do" can also be used to make sentences clearer and shorter.</p>
<p><em>Bill likes to swim, and so <u>does</u> Betty.</em></p>
<p>You asked if the sentence your student wrote is grammatically incorrect because of the use of "do." Well, there is one <strong>function</strong> of "do," which we have not yet discussed: <strong>emphasis</strong>.</p>
<p>"Do" is one way users of English bring attention to a whole or part of a message.</p>
<p>A whole sentence can be emphasized by adding "do." For example:</p>
<p><em>It <u>does</u> taste good!</em></p>
<p><em>We <u>did</u> enjoy the play.</em></p>
<p><em>I <u>do</u> want to learn.</em></p>
<p>The sentence you ask about is grammatically correct. The use of "do" shows emphasis.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is what your student meant when he wrote "do." He might need a little more help with answering questions. But the sentence is grammatically correct.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Sahraoui.</p>
<p>Do you have a question about American English? Send us an email at learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>

            <title>Science Celebrating 200 Years of Dinosaur Research  (2024/2/23)</title>

<span class="datetime">22 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>On February 20, 1824, British scientist and Christian clergyman William Buckland spoke before the Geological Society of London. He described the find of a huge jaw and other bones at a rock mine in the village of Stonesfield near Oxford, England.</p>
<p>Buckland recognized that these <strong>fossils</strong> belonged to a huge reptile of the long past. He gave it the scientific name Megalosaurus, meaning "great lizard."</p>
<p>With that, the first dinosaur was officially recognized, although the word dinosaur did not come for several more years.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton is seen at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum dinosaur and fossil hall in Washington, U.S., June 4, 2019. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/a6876986-3e65-4026-9731-f6ff8773ba4e_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">FILE - A Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton is seen at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum dinosaur and fossil hall in Washington, U.S., June 4, 2019. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>Buckland's talk "was the beginning of our <strong>fascination</strong> with dinosaurs," says University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte.</p>
<p>"His announcement opened the flood gates," he said, and many people launched their own fossil hunts.</p>
<p>"People went out looking for other <strong>giant</strong> bones in England and beyond," Brusatte said.</p>
<p>In the almost 200 years since, dinosaur science has ballooned. Researchers have learned much about how these creatures looked, lived and developed, or evolved. Scientists also learned what caused the disappearance of the ancient animals.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs lived from about 231 million years ago to 66 million years ago during the Mesozoic Era. They are ancestors to birds of today. Science has identified over 2,000 species of dinosaur.</p>
<p>"Our understanding of dinosaurs has changed <strong>significantly</strong> since the 19th century," said paleontologist Emma Nicholls of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. It is home to the Megalosaurus fossils that Buckland studied.</p>
<p>By the 1840s, other dinosaur researchers were learning that some dinosaurs walked on four legs and others walked on two legs. The Megalosaurus belongs to a group known as theropods. The group also includes meat-eaters Tyranosaurus and Spinosaurus, animals which "<strong>scampered</strong>" on their legs. Both species grew to about 9 meters tall and used their sharp <strong>claws</strong> and strong, toothy jaws to overpower <strong>prey</strong>, Brusatte said.</p>
<p>Evidence of dinosaurs has been found all around the world. The first complete dinosaur <strong>skeletons </strong>were set up in the 1870s.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the discovery of a small dinosaur changed popular thinking about the animal group. Deinonychus was a fast-moving meat-eater. Some smaller dinosaurs, like Archaeopteryx, were found to be very much like early birds in body structure. The new research confirmed how birds evolved from small, feathered dinosaurs.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, scientists used new imaging tools to learn more about how dinosaurs grew and moved. Other tools permitted them to make good guesses about their colors, because some dinosaur remains had small pieces of skin or feathers that contained pigment, or color.</p>
<p>Thomas Holtz is a paleontologist at the University of Maryland. He said all of the research created "a more <strong>dynamic</strong> and biological view of dinosaurs as living things."</p>
<p>In recent years, fossils have been found in China, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Hans-Dieter Sues is a paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. He said the most important recent discovery is that the theropods were covered with feathers although they could not fly. He said the feathers kept the dinosaurs warm and were used for show.</p>
<p>One question that concerned scientists from the beginning was why the dinosaurs died. They came up with many theories. One scientist even said small mammals might have eaten all the dinosaur eggs.</p>
<p>Scientists have since settled on an answer. They believe an asteroid that hit the Earth in what is now southern Mexico was to blame for the disappearance of dinosaurs. Experts believe the event destroyed about 75 percent of life on Earth, including all its dinosaurs.</p>
<p>But what if there had been no asteroid? Would dinosaurs still rule the world today?</p>
<p>Holtz of the University of Maryland says "almost certainly, yes." He notes that some mammals existed at the time of dinosaurs but they were all small. He said dinosaurs would have needed to evolve as the Earth cooled and some forests dried out.</p>
<p>In the last 200 years, scientists also have a better idea of the largest and smallest dinosaurs. One 2023 study said the largest dinosaur was Argentinosaurus, which measured about 35 meters long and weighed 76 tonnes.</p>
<p>But Holtz said there is still more research to be done.</p>
<p>He said many areas of the world have not been explored by paleontologists. That offers hope of more dino finds.</p>
<p>"There are almost assuredly entire groups of dinosaurs which we currently know nothing about waiting to be discovered," Holtz said.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Alabama has ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.</p>
<p>The ruling immediately influenced the way fertility treatment services operate in the southeastern U.S. state. On Wednesday, the University of Alabama Birmingham Hospital said it paused all fertility treatments while it considers the ruling's significance.</p>
<p>The court decision involved two wrongful death cases brought by three <strong>couples</strong> who had frozen embryos destroyed in an accident at a fertility center.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The exterior of the Alabama Supreme Court building in Montgomery, Ala., is shown Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Kim Chandler)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-71b5-08dc33c6e1df_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The exterior of the Alabama Supreme Court building in Montgomery, Ala., is shown Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Kim Chandler)</span></div>
<p>In their decision, the justices noted recent and longstanding parts of the Alabama Constitution. The justices ruled that an 1872 state law permitting parents to bring legal action over the death of a minor child "<strong>applies</strong> to all unborn children, regardless of their location."</p>
<p>"Unborn children are ‘children' ... without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other...<strong>characteristics</strong>," Justice Jay Mitchell wrote. The high court released the ruling on February 16.</p>
<p>Mitchell said the court had ruled earlier that fetuses killed while a woman is pregnant are covered under Alabama's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. Nothing excludes "<strong>extrauterine</strong> children from the Act's coverage," he wrote.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to influence fertility treatments and the activity of freezing of embryos, which are fertilized eggs. A court <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/opinions/cl-2021-15372-honeyhline-heidemann-v-jason-heidemann.pdf">opinion</a> in Virginia last year said that frozen embryos can be considered property.</p>
<p>Barbara Collura is chief of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a non-profit group based in Virginia. Collura told the Associated Press that the ruling raises questions for "in vitro fertilization," or IVF, the method of fertilizing eggs in a laboratory.</p>
<p>She said the "ruling is stating that a fertilized egg, which is a clump of cells, is now a person. It really puts into question, the practice of IVF." The group called the Alabama high court's decision "terrifying" for people affected by infertility.</p>
<p>She said the ruling also raises questions for providers of IVF services and for patients. It is unclear whether they can freeze embryos created during fertility treatment or if patients could ever donate or destroy unused embryos.</p>
<p>Sean Tipton is a spokesman with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. He said at least one Alabama fertility center was told to stop IVF treatments by the hospital overseeing it since the decision.</p>
<p>Dr. Paula Amato is president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Washington D.C. She said: "No health care provider will be willing to provide treatments if those treatments may lead to civil or criminal charges."</p>
<p>The couples in the Alabama case had undergone IVF treatments that led to the creation of several embryos. Some of the embryos were <strong>implanted</strong> and resulted in healthy births. The couples paid to keep the other embryos frozen in a storage center at the Mobile Infirmary Medical Center. A patient in 2020 entered the area and removed several embryos, dropping them on the floor and "killing them," the ruling said.</p>
<p>The justices then ruled that couple's wrongful death legal case could go forward. The clinic and hospital that are defendants in the case could ask the court to reconsider its decision.</p>
<p>One group that opposes abortion, the non-profit Live Action, supported the decision. "Each person, from the tiniest embryo to an elder nearing the end of his life...deserves and is guaranteed legal protection," said President Lila Rose in a statement.</p>
<p>Justice Greg Cook wrote the only full <strong>dissent</strong> to the majority opinion. He said the 1872 law did not define "minor child" and the meaning of the term was being extended to cover frozen embryos.</p>
<p>He added the ruling "almost certainly ends the creation of frozen embryos through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Alabama."</p>
<p>The Alabama Supreme Court decision partly depended on language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018. It states it is the policy of the "state to ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child."</p>
<p>In Alabama, supreme court justices are elected officials who serve six-year terms. Currently, all are members of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Luciana de Oliveira considers herself transnational. That means she is more than one nationality. de Oliveira grew up in Brazil, but she moved to the United States for her studies. She became a U.S. citizen in 2017.</p>
<p>de Oliveira has some strong feelings about national identity. She believes speaking a country's majority language is a very important part of one's national identity. de Oliveira speaks both Portuguese and English.</p>
<p>A new study found that most people around the world share those feelings about language and national identity.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Daughters of imprisoned women celebrate their 15th birthday, a tradition called quinceanera, at the San Marta Acatitla rehabilitation in the Iztapalapa neighborhood of Mexico City, Friday, Aug. 18, 2023.

<p>The Pew Research Center carried out the study and released the results last month. Pew's study centered on people's ideas about national identity. It included answers from people in more than 20 countries.</p>
<p>Pew researchers asked study <strong>participants</strong> about four aspects, or parts, of national identity: language, traditions, birthplace and religion. They found that language is by far the most valued aspect of national identity.</p>
<p>In fact, a median of 91 percent of people across 21 countries said that speaking a country's most common language is "important for being considered a true national."</p>
<p>Traditions and <strong>customs</strong> are also <strong>key</strong> to national identity, the study found. Beliefs about the other two aspects – birthplace and religion – were more divided.</p>
<p>VOA Learning English spoke with several people who live in countries that were included in the study. Among them is Jorge Catalan. He has lived in Mexico most of his life. The Pew study found that 93 percent of <strong>respondents</strong> from Mexico said that speaking the country's main language – Spanish – is important to national identity.</p>
<p>Catalan said he agrees that speaking Spanish is very important. But he added that it is regrettable.</p>
<p>He said, "Mexico is a place where we have around 68 spoken languages besides Spanish." He noted that the government has pushed Spanish as the main language throughout history and has turned it into a "must-have tool."</p>
<p>Agatha Janzen was born and raised in Canada. Pew researchers found that more than 80 percent of Canadians say that speaking the country's language is important to national identity. In Canada, both French and English are official languages.</p>
<p>Janzen said that "speaking one of the official languages is important to being Canadian for <strong>practical</strong> reasons."</p>
<p>Traditions and customs are also a central aspect of national identity, the study found. Results showed 81 percent of people believe sharing their country's customs and traditions is somewhat or very important to national identity.</p>
<p>The Pew study found that 67 percent of Brazilians consider practicing customs and traditions an important part of national identity. That is the fourth lowest percentage of all the countries included in the study.</p>
<p>But customs and traditions are important to de Oliveira. To feel closer to her Brazilian identity, she said she wears jewelry and shoes from Brazil and follows and supports Brazilian soccer.</p>
<p>Mexico is tied with the highest percentage of respondents who answered that customs and traditions are an important aspect of national identity. But for Catalan, they are not so important. He noted that Mexican traditions have changed over time. He added that he does not take part in many Mexican traditions, "but I still feel <strong>proudly</strong> Mexican."</p>
<p>Beliefs about the two other aspects of national identity – birthplace and religion – were more mixed. A median of 58 percent of respondents from 23 countries said that being born in a country is important to national identity. An even lower number of respondents – 42 percent – said that being a member of the country's main religion is important to national identity.</p>
<p>Respondents from Mexico and Indonesia had the strongest feelings about the importance of birthplace as central to national identity, at 91 percent.</p>
<p>Calatan, who was born and lived most of his life in Mexico, agrees somewhat. "If you are born outside of Mexico and never lived in it, it would be difficult to get a real sense of what being Mexican means."</p>
<p>But Janzen, the Canadian, said, "Being born in Canada has nothing to do with being Canadian." For her, Canada is a <strong>melting pot</strong> and offers refuge to those who need it.</p>
<p>These ideas match the results of the study. Countries where immigrants make up a smaller share of the population tend to see birthplace as a more important aspect of national identity. Countries with a greater share of immigrants are more willing to accept those born outside of the country as true nationals.</p>
<p>Less than half of people in most of the countries in the study do not feel religion is important to national identity. All of those who spoke with Learning English said they agreed that religion is not an important part of national identity.</p>
<p>Christine Huang is a research associate at the Pew Research Center. She is one of the writers of the study. She told Learning English, "This question of belonging in a country is related to other work we have done to measure how connected people feel to each other."</p>
<p>Huang added, "When looking at how people relate to others in their community, in their country, and all over the world, people most frequently report feeling close to others in their country."</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">22 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>In a recent <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/what-is-popular-in-your-country-/7488370.html" target="_blank">lesson</a>, we asked our readers and listeners to write to us about what is popular in their country.</p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will explore some of what was written to us. Our audience will be the guides of our imaginative tour of cultures around the world. We will learn about English grammar on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Turkey </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-8477-08dc33422395_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar </span></div>
<p>Let's start with a message from a friend in Turkey.</p>
<p><em>Greetings from Turkey, I am Furkan. </em></p>
<p><em>I think, K<i></i>305;vanc Tatl<i></i>305;tug is a popular in Turkey. Because the whole country knows him. </em></p>
<p>Furkan wrote a very clear message. Our main suggestion is to remove a couple of words and add a little more explanation.</p>
<p>We can take out the words "I think." We can also remove the part about the "whole country knows him."</p>
<p>When we say someone is popular, we can <strong>assume</strong> that many or most people in a place know about the person.</p>
<p>You could also explain a little more deeply why Kivanc Tatlitug is popular. For example, you might say he is handsome, talented, and so on.</p>
<p>So, you might update the message to something like this:</p>
<p><em>K<i></i>305;vanc Tatl<i></i>305;tug is popular in Turkey <u>because he is handsome, talented, and wealthy</u>. </em></p>
<p><strong>Venezuela </strong></p>
<p>Now let's examine part of a message from Gorka in Venezuela. Gorka says this about baseball, a popular sport in the country:</p>
<p>
<em>... this sport is practiced by people of all ages and in all the states of the country. There are many baseball schools, some of them <strong>sponsored</strong> by American baseball organizations.<br/>
Every year more that one hundred Venezuelan baseball players go to USA to play in the MLB or other related leagues.<br/>
Not surprisingly these players inspire younger baseball players to follow their steps. </em></p>
<p>Gorka wrote an excellent description. Our main suggestion is to pay careful attention to short words.</p>
<p>Instead of "that" we can use "than," as in "more than one hundred Venezuelan baseball players." And we want to add "the" in front of "USA" like this:</p>
<p><em>Every year, more <u>than</u> one hundred Venezuelan baseball players <u>go to the USA</u> to play in the MLB or other related leagues. </em></p>
<p>A final word about the last sentence from Gorka. While it is correct to say "follow their steps," in this situation, we often say "follow in their footsteps." We use "follow in their footsteps" when someone does something before us and we follow what they did. For example:</p>
<p><em>If your father is a doctor and you become a doctor, you could say that you are <u>following in your father's footsteps</u>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Japan </strong></p>
<p>Now let's turn to Japan. An unnamed reader sent us this note about a popular food.</p>
<p><em>Most popular food in Japan is RAMEN. I think because Ramen has huge kinds of taste. </em></p>
<p>The message is clear and to the point. Once again, we need to pay special attention to short words and remove a few other words. We need to include the word "the" at the beginning of the message, as in:</p>
<p><em><u>The</u> most popular food in Japan is ramen. </em></p>
<p>While the meaning of "huge kinds of taste" is understandable, we might instead use different structures to express the same idea. For example, English speakers might say that the taste is complex, bold, or rich. We might update the entire message to something like this:</p>
<p><em>The most popular food in Japan is ramen because it <u>has a rich, complex taste. </u></em></p>
<p><strong>Spain </strong></p>
<p>Finally, Rafael from Spain writes to us. He notes that he does not like the most popular sport, soccer. Rafael ends his message with the following:</p>
<p><em>... Since I don't like soccer, I feel a little weirdo. But not as much as you, John, who are in love with grammar!<br/>
Thank you very much for your teaching, John,<br/>
See you soon! </em></p>
<p>Rafael wrote a very light-hearted, humorous message. The main correction needed is to add the word "like" after the verb "feel" and remove the word "little." So, the statement could become:</p>
<p><em>Since I don't like soccer, I feel <u>like</u> a weirdo. </em></p>
<p>A quick note about the term "weirdo." We often use it in a negative, or disapproving, way. So, you should be careful about using it. If you choose to use the term, make sure that the person it is directed at understands that you are not being serious.</p>
<p>Rafael's message, for example, clearly used the word in a joking manner. Still, his point is correct:</p>
<p><em>I am a grammar weirdo.</em></p>
<p>And that's Everyday Grammar.</p>

            <title>Study Finds Majority of Retired People Enjoy VR  (2024/2/22)</title>

<p>A new study found that a majority of retired people who experienced <strong>virtual reality</strong> (VR) said they liked using the technology.</p>
<p>The study is part of an effort that aims to find ways older adults, known as seniors, can use VR systems. Earlier research has shown the technology can improve emotional health and reduce loneliness in some individuals. It might also help dementia patients better deal with their condition.</p>
<p>During the study, VR systems were introduced in 17 different retirement communities across the United States. A total of 245 people – between the ages of 65 and 103 – took part in the experiment.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Tracy Hall, vice president of sales at Mynd Immersive, left, watches as Karen Audet, 82, right, reacts while wearing a virtual reality headset at John Knox Village, Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024, in Pompano Beach, Fla.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)</span></div>
<p>The seniors chose from different VR environments offering digital experiences that lasted several minutes. They wore headsets providing a full 360-degrees of sights and sounds to recreate realistic digital environments.</p>
<p>Examples of the digital experiences included parachuting, riding in vehicles, watching music performances, playing with animals, or visiting famous places.</p>
<p>The experiments were led by researchers at Stanford University in northern California. The scientists worked on the project with a Texas-based company called Mynd Immersive, which designs VR products for aging people.</p>
<p>The researchers said nearly 80 percent of those taking part in the experiment reported that their emotional state had improved after the VR experience. Nearly 60 percent of the seniors said the VR system also helped them feel less <strong>isolated</strong> socially.</p>
<p>The team recently published the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cyber.2023.0188">study</a> results in the publication <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</em>.</p>
<p>The study also collected information from caregivers of people involved in the study. Nearly 75 percent of caregivers said the <strong>moods</strong> of the seniors improved after using VR. And more than 80 percent of test subjects and 95 percent of caregivers said talking about the VR experience improved relationships with others.</p>
<p>Ryan Moore is a doctoral candidate at Stanford University who led the research. He told The Associated Press that for most of the seniors involved, it was their first time using VR. "They enjoyed it," Moore said. He added, "They were likely to <strong>recommend</strong> it to others, and they looked forward to doing it again."</p>
<p>Farrell Patrick is a 91-year-old retired Army officer who took part in the VR experiment. He used to teach computer science at the United States Military Academy at West Point and two private universities as well. Patrick now lives in a retirement community in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>Patrick experienced the VR flight of a Navy fighter pilot along the coast of Florida. "Oh my God, that's beautiful," he told the AP while wearing the VR headset.</p>
<p>Terry Colli is a former public relations director at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. The 76-year-old told the AP of his 2022 VR experience, "It brought back memories of my travels and...brought back memories of my experience growing up on a farm."</p>
<p>Anne Selby is a 79-year-old retired <strong>counselor</strong> and artist. She said her VR experience "<strong>stimulated</strong>" every area of her brain as well as all the senses. "I particularly enjoyed the ones dealing with pets because I have a cat and I've had pets most of my life," Selby said.</p>
<p>The Florida community where Farrell Patrick lives, John Knox Village, has carried out VR experiments with seniors suffering from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The researchers said the technology helped the individuals remember things from their past that some wanted to share with their caregivers.</p>
<p>Hana Salem, a worker at John Knox, told the AP, "It is like they come back to life when they tell their story." She added that some dementia patients who normally do not speak a lot, sometimes "<strong>perk up</strong>" after going through a VR experience.</p>
<p>"They'll start laughing and saying, ‘Ooh, I'm going to catch the butterflies,'" Salem explained. The catching of butterflies is part of a game Mynd Immersive developed to help seniors improve their movements and <strong>flexibility</strong> as they stand and reach for objects.</p>

<p>South Korea's biggest hospitals canceled medical procedures and turned away patients seeking emergency care on Wednesday. The moves came after thousands of trainee doctors walked off the job to protest a government plan to increase the number of people admitted to medical school.</p>
<p>One hospital, the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, had a sign saying its emergency division was only taking heart attack cases. The emergency departments at four other major hospitals were also on "red alert." That means they did not have room for more patients.</p>
<p>"It is so <strong>frustrating</strong> that the <strong>resident</strong> doctors' strike is happening now," the brother of a cancer patient told the newspaper <em>JoongAng Ilbo. </em>He added that he and his brother had spent 10 hours looking for a hospital bed.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Doctors and medical workers take part in a protest against a plan to admit more students to medical school, in front of the Presidential Office in Seoul, South Korea, February 21, 2024.

(REUTERS/Kim Soo-Hyeon)</span></div>
<p>The health ministry says 7,813 doctors have walked out of their jobs since protests began this week. The doctors object to a plan by the government to increase the number of medical students. The plan aims to bring more health workers to rural areas and meet the demands of one of the world's most quickly aging <strong>societies</strong>.</p>
<p>The government wants to increase the number of medical students from 3,000 to 5,000 by the 2025 school year. It aims to add up to 10,000 more by 2035.</p>
<p>The protesters, however, say South Korea has enough doctors. They say the government needs to improve the pay and working conditions of doctors before increasing the number of medical students.</p>
<p>South Korea's population of 52 million had 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people in 2022. Those numbers are far below the average of 3.7 doctors per 1,000 people for developed countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
<p>Public opinion studies in South Korea show many Koreans support the government plan. Last week, a Gallup Korea study said about 76 percent of South Koreans back the government's plan to increase the number of medical students.</p>
<p>One group taking part in the protest called the plan a political measure ahead of a general election in April.</p>
<p>"We couldn't just sit back and watch medical policies built only <strong>for the sake of</strong> winning the general election," the Korea Interns and Residents Association said in a statement.</p>
<p>Local media said between one-third and half of scheduled surgeries at five major hospitals have been canceled due to the walkout.</p>
<p>The protests have continued despite a government order for the doctors to return to work.</p>
<p>Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told reporters, "The basic calling of medical professionals is to protect the health and lives of the people, and any group action that threatens that cannot be justified."</p>
<p>Safety Minister Lee Sang-min later threatened the protest leaders with possible arrest.</p>
<p>"The police and the <strong>prosecutors'</strong> office will <strong>consult</strong> and take measures against any group or individuals who are leading collective action, including arrest and investigation," he said.</p>

<span class="datetime">21 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>For five years, a New York City man lived for free in a famous central New York City hotel. He made use of a little-known housing rule to avoid paying.</p>
<p>But government lawyers recently said Mickey Barreto went too far. He turned in paperwork claiming ownership of the whole New Yorker Hotel building. And he also tried to have another person pay him for living there.</p>
<p>Last week, Barreto was arrested and charged with turning in false property records, a criminal offense. The 48-year-old man says he was surprised when police showed up at his boyfriend's <strong>apartment</strong> with guns and protective gear.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The New Yorker Hotel is seen in New York, Nov. 8, 2013.

<p>"I said, ‘Oh, I thought you were doing something for Valentine's Day to <strong>spice</strong> up the relationship until I saw the female officers,'" Barreto recalled telling his boyfriend. Valentine's Day is a holiday where people celebrate love.</p>
<p>The charges against Barreto came after years of legal battles. They began when he and his boyfriend paid about $200 to stay in one of the more than 1,000 rooms in the hotel built in 1930.</p>
<p>Barreto says he had just moved to New York from Los Angeles, California when his boyfriend told him about a little-known part of housing law that permits people who stay in single rooms in buildings built before 1969 to demand a six-month contract.</p>
<p>Barreto claimed that because he had paid for a night in the hotel, he was counted as a <strong>tenant</strong>. He asked for a contract to stay and the hotel immediately had him leave.</p>
<p>Barreto said he went to court the next day and the judge denied him. But he said, "I appealed to the (state) Supreme Court and I won the appeal." But he added that at an important point in the case, lawyers for the building's owners did not show up, which permitted him to win by <strong>default</strong>.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the hotel to give Barreto a key. He said he lived there until July 2023 without paying for his room because the building's owners did not want to work out a contract with him. But they could not ask him to leave.</p>
<p>New York City <strong>prosecutors</strong> agree that the housing court gave Barreto "possession" of his room. But they say he did not stop there.</p>
<p>In 2019, he put false paperwork on a city website claiming that the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity had turned over the ownership of the entire building to him. The organization bought the property in 1976. The church was founded in South Korea by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon.</p>
<p>Barreto then tried to charge different groups as the owner of the building. The prosecutor's office said they include demanding payments from one of the hotel's tenants and demanding the hotel put its bank accounts in his name.</p>
<p>The Unification Church took Barreto to court in 2019 over the building's ownership claim. The case is ongoing, but a judge ruled that Barreto cannot present himself as the owner in the meantime.</p>
<p>A Unification Church spokesperson did not comment on his arrest as there is an ongoing civil case.</p>
<p>In that case, Barreto argued that the judge who gave him "possession" of his room indirectly gave him the entire building because it had never been subdivided.</p>
<p>"I never <strong>intended </strong>to <strong>commit</strong> any <strong>fraud</strong>. I don't believe I ever committed any fraud," Barreto said. He said he never made any money out of this.</p>
<p>Barreto said he aims to deny profits to the Unification Church. The church, known for holding large weddings, has been accused of misleading people to gain members and criticized by some over its friendly relationship with North Korea, where Moon was born.</p>
<p>Barreto said he has never paid for a lawyer and has always represented himself in civil cases. Last week, he secured criminal defense legal representation.</p>

<p>Charlotte has spent much of her life in captivity at a non-profit <strong>aquarium</strong> in North Carolina's Appalachian Mountains. She is an ocean animal called a round stingray.</p>
<p>She is about 3,700 kilometers from her natural <strong>habitat </strong>in the Pacific Ocean off southern California. And she has not shared space with a male of her species in at least eight years.</p>
<p>But Charlotte is about to give birth. The reddish-brown stingray is pregnant with as many as four young, called pups. They were created by a rare process of natural reproduction called parthenogenesis. A female animal develops an egg into an embryo without fertilization material from a male.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kinsley Boyette, assistant director of the Aquarium and Shark Lab by Team ECCO, poses in this undated photo next to Charlotte, a round stingray, in the American town of Hendersonville, North Carolina.

(Aquarium and Shark Lab by Team ECCO via AP)</span></div>
<p>Charlotte will give birth to her young at home: Team ECCO Aquarium and Shark Lab on Main Street in Hendersonville. Brenda Ramer formed the organization and serves as its chief.</p>
<p>She said, when caretakers first noticed a <strong>lump</strong> on Charlotte's back, they thought it might be a cancerous growth. So, they examined the animal with an ultrasound machine, which makes images using sound. The images showed that Charlotte was pregnant.</p>
<p>The aquarium team was shocked.</p>
<p>"We were all like, ‘Shut the back door. There's no way,'" Ramer said. "We thought we were overfeeding her. But we were overfeeding her because she has more mouths to feed."</p>
<p>The small aquarium <strong>encourages</strong> local schoolchildren and others to take an interest in science. Now, they are getting a real-life lesson few witness. Parthenogenesis can happen in some insects, fish, amphibians, birds and reptiles, but it is extremely unusual. Documented examples have included California condors, Komodo dragons and yellow-bellied water snakes.</p>
<p>Kady Lyons is a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. She is not connected to the North Carolina aquarium. She said Charlotte's pregnancy is the only documented example of parthenogenesis in the round stingray that she knows of.</p>
<p>But Lyons is not shocked. Other kinds of rays, and related fish such as sharks, have had these kinds of pregnancies under human care.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised, because nature finds a way of having this happen," she said.</p>
<p>To be clear, Lyons said, these animals are not <strong>cloning</strong> themselves. Instead, a female's egg joins with another cell in the female. This leads to cell division and creation of an embryo.</p>
<p>"We don't know why it happens," Lyons said. "Just that it's kind of this really neat <strong>phenomenon </strong>that they seem to be able to do."</p>
<p>Charlotte lives in a tank of about 8,300 liters of water. Ramer said the aquarium is hoping to get a tank nearly twice that size for Charlotte's young. They also want to put live cameras up for people to see them.</p>
<p>"It is very rare to happen," Ramer said. "But it's happening in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains in rural North Carolina, hundreds of miles from the ocean."</p>
<p>Round stingrays like Charlotte are common along the Pacific Ocean coasts of southern California and Mexico. They often rest on the ocean's sandy bottom near land.</p>
<p>In the wild, they are about the size of a food plate. They come in all <strong>shades</strong> of brown. They eat small animals like worms, crabs and mollusks. And round stingrays are sometimes eaten by sharks, seals and giant sea bass.</p>
<p>The round ray is well known to humans who like to go in the ocean. The ray can sting when stepped on.</p>
<p>Lyons finds the species <strong>fascinating</strong>.</p>
<p>"I'm glad the round stingray is getting the media attention that it deserves," Lyons said. "It's not necessarily as sexy as a white shark, but they do a lot of really <strong>neat</strong> stuff."</p>

<span class="datetime">20 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>The maker of ChatGPT recently announced its next move into generative artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based OpenAI's new text-to-video <strong>generator</strong>, called Sora, is a tool that instantly makes short videos based on written commands, called prompts.</p>
<p>Sora is not the first of its kind. Google, Meta and Runway ML are among the other companies to have developed similar technology.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The OpenAI logo is displayed on a cell phone with an image on a computer monitor generated by ChatGPT's Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston.(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7b0c08e3-1090-4fe6-be13-2b226b00980a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The OpenAI logo is displayed on a cell phone with an image on a computer monitor generated by ChatGPT's Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston.(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)</span></div>
<p>But the high quality of videos displayed by OpenAI — some after CEO Sam Altman asked social media users to send in ideas for written prompts — surprised observers. At the same time, the video results led to fears about the possible ethical and societal effects.</p>
<p>A photographer from New Hampshire posted one suggestion, or prompt, on X. The prompt gave details about a kind of food to be cooked, gnocchi, as well as the setting – an old Italian country kitchen.</p>
<p>The prompt said:</p>
<p>"A instructional cooking session for homemade gnocchi hosted by a grandmother social media influencer set in a <strong>rustic</strong> Tuscan country kitchen with cinematic lighting."</p>
<p>Altman answered a short time later with a realistic video that showed what the <strong>prompt</strong> described.</p>
<p>The tool is not yet publicly available. OpenAI has given limited information about how it was built. The company also has not stated what imagery and video sources were used to train Sora.</p>
<p>The New York Times and some writers have taken legal actions against OpenAI for its use of copyrighted works of writing to train ChatGPT. And OpenAI pays a fee to The Associated Press, the source of this report, to license its text news <strong>archive</strong>.</p>
<p>OpenAI said in a blog post that it is communicating with artists, policymakers and others before releasing the new tool to the public.</p>
<p>The company added that it is working with "red teamers" – people who try to find problems and give helpful suggestions – to develop Sora.</p>
<p>"We are working with red teamers — ... experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias — who will be <strong>adversarially </strong>testing the model," the company said.</p>
<p>"We're also building tools to help detect misleading content such as a detection<strong> classifier </strong>that can tell when a video was generated by Sora."</p>

<p>When Clarissa Haglid completed <strong>culinary</strong> school at the Delaware Food Bank last summer, it was the first time she had graduated from anything in her life.</p>
<p>Just a few years earlier, a goal like that did not seem within reach. In 2020, she was charged with armed robbery and later sentenced to prison. Haglid told VOA that she "lost everything," including the <strong>custody</strong> of her children.</p>
<p>As she approached the end of her four-year prison sentence, she learned about a restaurant service training program available to people in jail. Haglid started attending culinary school classes at the Food Bank in Newark, Delaware, when she received permission to take part in the work-release program. Through the 14-week program, students learned cooking and life skills to prepare them for a job in the restaurant or <strong>hospitality</strong> industry.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Clarissa Haglid, a graduate of the culinary school at the Delaware Food Bank, in the food bank's kitchen on February 7, 2024.

<p>Some of the students currently at Newark were <strong>incarcerated</strong> like Haglid. Others are in substance abuse recovery programs or underemployed, meaning they have been out of the workforce for a long time, said Anna McDermott. She is the Food Bank's Chief Impact Officer.</p>
<p>Haglid and other students learned how to use knives in cooking, correct food preparation, and how to make the five foundational "mother" sauces and other skills. The program also teaches teamwork, <strong>work ethic</strong> and time <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p>Those kinds of life skills, also called "soft skills," are taught to "make sure that folks are really familiar with what is expected of them in the workplace to maintain employment," McDermott said. "Getting a job is the easiest part, sometimes. It's maintaining that job."</p>
<p>At the end of the program, students are provided an entry-level job through the state restaurant association. Haglid is an <strong>apprentice</strong> at a nearby hotel, where she receives a paycheck and additional training as a cook.</p>
<p>"This program meant everything to me because...it was a way for me to get not my life back, but a life to begin with," Haglid said. Attending the culinary school started to "bridge the gap of <strong>restora</strong><strong>tion</strong> between me and my kids."</p>
<p>Haglid was able to attend the classes through a U.S. Department of Labor program called HOPES, Hospitality Opportunities for People Reentering Society. HOPES is operated through the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation (NRAEF), an industry group, which partners with community organizations like the Delaware Food Bank. The group's goal with HOPES is to get incarcerated people training and jobs in the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Rob Gifford is president of the NRAEF. He said restaurant jobs help prevent recidivism, the word for returning to prison. Gifford said food service jobs help people released from prison get work and a way to earn money as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Food service, he said, has a "relatively low barrier to entry," compared to other jobs that might require more training. Since prisons provide food service, there is already a place to provide training. And unlike other work, restaurant jobs often do not require college or even high school degrees.</p>
<p>"We're allowing these individuals to get on their feet quickly via the restaurant industry, but we're giving them ... <strong>transferable</strong> <strong>skills</strong>," Gifford said. "When they decide they're ready to move on to their next <strong>opportunity</strong>... they're positioned for success."</p>
<p>Employment for formerly imprisoned people is very important to prevent recidivism. The NRAEF says that formerly imprisoned people who maintained a job for the first year following their release had a 16 percent recidivism rate over three years. That is compared to a 52 percent recidivism rate for those that did not maintain employment. The unemployment rate for people formerly incarcerated is more than six times the national rate.</p>
<p>Gifford said about 1000 people have gone through the HOPES program nationwide, and two-thirds are currently employed.</p>
<p>Haglid, who said she is regaining custody of her children, plans to continue her work in restaurants and one day lead a kitchen as a chef. She also said she wants to support the educational and job training programs that helped her find work. She said the programs are needed to prevent recidivism and provide hope for the future.</p>
<p>"When you realize you have the ability to learn, (it) almost creates a hunger in you where you want to <strong>absorb</strong> as much as you possibly can," Haglid said. "You begin to have a drive that you never had before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Japan's economy has dropped to the fourth largest in the world. It fell behind Germany after its economy shrank in the last quarter of 2023.<br/>
日本经济已跌至世界第四位。在2023年最后一个季度经济萎缩后，它掉到了德国之后。</p>
<p>The Japanese government reported Thursday the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in October to December.<br/>
日本政府星期四报告说，去年10月至12月，日本经济以0.4%的年化速度萎缩。</p>
<p>It shrunk 2.9 percent from July to September. Two straight quarters of shrinkage are considered a sign that an economy is in a recession.<br/>
从7月到9月，这一数字萎缩了2.9%。连续两个季度的萎缩被认为是经济陷入衰退的迹象。</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product is a measure of the value of a nation's products and services. The yearly rate measures what would have happened if the quarterly rate lasted a year.<br/>
实际国内生产总值是衡量一个国家产品和服务价值的指标。年化比率衡量的是如果季度比率持续一年会发生什么。</p>
<p>Japan's economy was the second largest until 2010, when it was overtaken by China's. It had been the third-largest economy until it fell behind Germany.<br/>
日本经济在2010年之前一直是第二大经济体，后来被中国赶超。在落后于德国之前，日本一直是第三大经济体。</p>
<p>Japan's nominal GDP totaled $4.2 trillion last year. Germany's was between $4.4 and $4.5 trillion.<br/>
日本去年的名义国内生产总值为4.2万亿美元。德国为4.4至4.5万亿美元。</p>
<p>Real GDP takes into account inflation, while nominal GDP does not.<br/>
实际国内生产总值考虑了通货膨胀，而名义国内生产总值则没有。</p>
<p>A weaker Japanese yen was a major reason for the drop to fourth place. But economists say the drop is also due to a decline in its population and slowing productivity and competitiveness.<br/>
日元走弱是日本跌至第四位的主要原因。但经济学家表示，排名下降也是由于日本人口减少、生产力和竞争力下降。</p>
<p>In the past, Japan was described as a "an economic miracle." After much of the country was destroyed in World War II, it became the second-largest economy after the United States. It continued to see strong growth in the 1970s and 1980s. But in the last 30 years, the economy has grown only moderately at times.<br/>
过去，日本被描述为“经济奇迹”。在日本大部分地区在二战中被摧毁后，它成为仅次于美国的第二大经济体。它在上世纪七八十年代继续保持强劲增长。但在过去的30年里，日本经济有时只是勉强增长。</p>
<p>Both the Japanese and German economies are powered by strong small- and medium-size businesses with strong productivity.<br/>
日本和德国的经济都由具有强大生产力的强势中小型企业提供动力。</p>
<p>Germany's economy has gotten very strong in the past 20 years. It has led worldwide markets for high-end products like luxury cars and industrial machinery. It has sold so much to the rest of the world that half its economy ran on exports. But Germany's economy also shrank in the last quarter, by 0.3 percent.<br/>
德国经济在过去20年里变得非常强劲。它引领了全球高端产品市场，如豪华汽车和工业机械。它向世界其他地区的出口如此之多，以至于其一半的经济都依赖出口。但德国经济在上一季度也出现了0.3%的萎缩。</p>
<p>Japan's population has been shrinking and aging for many years. It has few foreign residents. Germany's population has grown to nearly 85 million. Immigration helped to make up for a low birth rate in Germany.<br/>
多年来，日本人口一直在减少和老龄化。它几乎没有外国居民。德国的人口已经增长到近8500万。移民帮助弥补了德国的低出生率。</p>
<p>Immigration is one way to solve Japan's labor shortage problem. But the country has been somewhat unaccepting of foreign labor.<br/>
移民是解决日本劳动力短缺问题的一种方式。但这个国家一直有点不接受外国劳动力。</p>
<p>Another reason for Japan's slow growth is stagnating wages. People have less money to spend. At the same time, businesses have invested heavily in foreign economies instead of Japan's aging and shrinking market.<br/>
日本经济增长缓慢的另一个原因是工资停滞不前。人们可花的钱越来越少。与此同时，企业对外国经济体进行了大量投资，而不是对老龄化和萎缩的日本市场进行投资。</p>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">19 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>A group of environmental organizations is seeking an official declaration that American horseshoe crabs are endangered.</p>
<p>The groups have requested the declaration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The U.S. agency administers the Endangered Species Act, which was established in 1973.</p>
<p>The American horseshoe crab – known as a "living <strong>fossil</strong>" – is one of the oldest living creatures on Earth. It is believed to date back at least 450 million years. Scientists do not actually consider horseshoes true crabs. This is because they are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than to other sea creatures.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Atlantic Horseshoe crabs come ashore to spawn and lay their eggs on Pickering Beach, a national horseshoe crab sanctuary near Little Creek, Delaware, May 20, 2008. (REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-15fb-08dc2eef8285_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Atlantic Horseshoe crabs come ashore to spawn and lay their eggs on Pickering Beach, a national horseshoe crab sanctuary near Little Creek, Delaware, May 20, 2008. (REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>If NOAA approves the endangered declaration, it would generally make it unlawful for people to harm or kill a horseshoe crab without an official permit to do so.</p>
<p>Research suggests horseshoe crab populations in the U.S. have decreased sharply over the past 30 years. For example, growth numbers for the animals are down two-thirds from 1990 in an area of the Delaware Bay. Environmental groups say this body of water in the northeastern state of Delaware once held the largest population of horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p>Research also shows that egg densities for the animals have fallen more than 80 percent over the past 40 years. The reproduction drops are linked to environmental changes causing other sea creatures to eat their <strong>larvae</strong> and eggs, researchers say.</p>
<p>A collection of 23 environmental groups have joined to seek the endangered declaration. The request, or petition, also seeks the establishment of a "critical <strong>habitat</strong>" for horseshoe crabs to be protected.</p>
<p>The request names numerous threats to the animals – all of which are blamed on human activities. These include harvesting the crabs to be used for <strong>bait</strong>, use in biomedical activities, habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for NOAA confirmed to Reuters news service the agency was examining the groups' petition, but did not comment further.</p>
<p>Will Harlan is a senior scientist at the Arizona-based <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a>. He told Reuters, "We're <strong>wiping out</strong> one of the world's oldest and toughest creatures." His group is one of those seeking the endangered declaration.</p>
<p>Drug manufacturers harvest horseshoe crabs in large numbers for their blue-colored blood. The blood is used to test and develop drugs and medical devices. The petition states that in 2022, nearly 1 million of the animals were used for medical purposes.</p>
<p>Current law permits the biomedical industry to capture small amounts of horseshoe crab blood before releasing the animals alive to areas where they were collected.</p>
<p>However, NOAA says between 10 to 15 percent of harvested animals die during this process. Harlan said non-industry research suggests this rate is even higher. Those estimates show that 30 percent of horseshoe crabs captured for blood collection die in the process.</p>
<p>Harlan noted that while <strong>synthetic </strong>blood versions are widely used in Europe, American companies have been slow to use them.</p>
<p>The petition says the other main cause of population drops is overharvesting of horseshoe crabs for <strong>commercial</strong> fisheries. Environmental activists say this is likely to continue, with no sign of recovery even after harvesting limits were established.</p>

<p>A new study suggests that the climate change diet might not be good for polar bears.</p>
<p>With Arctic sea ice declining, many polar bears have to go to land for their diets during parts of the summer.</p>
<p>A study looking at Hudson Bay polar bears tried to figure out if the creatures can keep their healthy weight levels on such a diet.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A polar bear eats whale meat as it walks along the shore of Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba, Aug. 23, 2010.

<p>Researchers found that the majority of the creatures are losing weight no matter what they do to try to increase it.</p>
<p>Some bears find a lot of food — berries, eggs, sea birds and even caribou antlers. But such foods take a lot of effort. The bears use so many calories trying to eat that they end up losing weight and burning more energy than they take in, the study says.</p>
<p>The findings appeared recently in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a>.</p>
<p>Other bears go into a time of semi-<strong>hibernation</strong>. But they also lose weight.</p>
<p>So either way – eating different foods or sleeping a lot – does not work, said the study's lead writer Anthony Pagano of the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>
<p><strong>Losing weight </strong></p>
<p>Researchers found that 19 of the 20 bears studied dropped an average of 21 kilograms over three weeks of being studied. The research observed their calorie intake, energy use and <strong>respiration</strong> in the wild.</p>
<p>The bears lost about 7 percent of their body mass on average in just 21 days, the study found.</p>
<p>Polar bears try to keep up their weight in the summer after a spring when they eat a lot and gain weight. In the area of the Hudson Bay where researchers studied, lack of sea ice has meant polar bears are on land three weeks longer than in the 1980s, Pagano said.</p>
<p>Usually, polar bears eat high-fat seals while based on sea ice near where the seals are. Hunting is especially good in the spring when seal pups are young and have not yet learned to swim away from the ice base, Pagano said.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of sea ice </strong></p>
<p>Last September, when Arctic sea ice hit its yearly low, there was about 2.6 million square kilometers less sea ice than the same time in 1979, the National Snow and Ice Data Center says. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists polar bears as a threatened species "due to the loss of its sea ice <strong>habitat</strong>."</p>
<p>"This paper clearly shows that polar bears cannot <strong>adapt</strong> to the <strong>pace</strong> of change in the Arctic and that the bears are already using everything they have to stay alive,'' said University of Alberta biologist Andrew Derocher. Derocher was not part of the research but suggested it was important and done well.</p>
<p>"This is concerning because of course it really does raise the question of when will the individual bears run out of energy," Derocher said. While research shows that some of the bears will survive, "other bears were basically right on the edge of where they would potentially suffer from starvation and subsequent death."</p>
<p>Overall, the research shows that it is unlikely polar bears can adapt to living on land, Derocher said.</p>

<p>Trying to grow grass in the deserts or other dry places can seem like a losing battle. As a result, many people who live in such climates will use rocks, gravel, or man-made materials as groundcover instead of grass.</p>
<p>But there are several tough, low-growing groundcovers that perform well in dry climates. They may not be able to survive the foot traffic that <strong>fake</strong> grass can. But they appeal to environmentally helpful insects and in many cases make your property look better.</p>
<p><strong>Groundcovers for dry climate</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated image provided by Bugwood.org shows a Silverbush (Convolvulus cneorum) plant in bloom. The fast-growing, drought-tolerant evergreen is a good choice for covering ground in desert climates.

<p>Desert marigold, or Baileya multiradiata, is one such plant. The groundcover has pretty yellow blossoms and silver leaves. They <strong>bloom</strong> in the spring. The plant requires very little water. However, it lives only one season. People who want desert marigold must plant it every year.</p>
<p>Gold Mound lantana, known as Lantana camara, is a <strong>bushy</strong> plant usually just over a half-meter tall. Its yellow flowers bloom on and off from spring through autumn and it has low to moderate water needs.</p>
<p>Its relative, trailing lantana, or Lantana montevidensis, grows <strong>horizontally</strong>. Its purple blossoms brighten the garden year-round. The groundcover has moderate water needs. It favors full sunlight but can survive partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Trailing indigo, or Dalea greggii, is another groundcover that grows well in dry climates. The long-lived plant has blue-gray leaves and pink or purple pea-shaped flowers. It blooms from spring through summer in full or partial sunlight. The plant, which can spread to three meters wide, has very low water needs but could use some watering while in bloom.</p>
<p>Silverbush, also known as Convolvulus cneorum, is a fast-growing evergreen that, in the desert, blooms for about two weeks in spring. The 60-centimeter-tall plant has yellow-centered white flowers with silver leaves.</p>
<p>White evening primrose, Oenothera caespitosa, is usually covered in blooms from spring through summer. But they are only open from late <strong>afternoon</strong> into morning. The white blossoms develop to light pink, and then darken to deep pinkish-purple. The plant has moderate water needs and performs best in full sun to part shade.</p>
<p><strong>Best time to plant</strong></p>
<p>Early spring is the best time to plant these groundcovers in desert climates.</p>
<p>Gently loosen the soil to about 30 centimeters deep, removing stones and other hard material to permit a clear path for roots. Give some space between the plants. Add mulch or wood chips to keep soil temperature even, prevent weeds, and help hold water.</p>
<p>The best time of day to water the groundcovers is in the morning. To avoid root <strong>rot</strong>, water the groundcover only when, and as soon as, the soil is completely dry.</p>

<p>Many people who find out they have cancer are able to survive the disease because of effective drugs.</p>
<p>Treating cancer with certain drugs is known as chemotherapy. The drugs contain powerful chemicals that kill cancer cells but also cause bad reactions in patients.</p>
<p>Although the drugs help keep patients alive, they cause extreme tiredness, stomach pain and the loss of hair. Some even result in mouth <strong>sores</strong> for patients. These problems are called side effects.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Jill Feldman, 54, poses for a photo at her home in Deerfield, Ill., Friday, Jan. 19, 2024.

<p>After many years of strong side effects, some patients and their doctors are talking to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about finding the lowest effective <strong>dose</strong> for cancer drugs.</p>
<p>In the past, drug companies tested to find the "<strong>maximum</strong> <strong>tolerable</strong> dose." However, doctors and patients are asking drugmakers to think about a dose that will kill cancer cells with less severe side effects. Some patients might prefer the lower dose even if they need to use the drug longer.</p>
<p>Jill Feldman of Illinois is 54. She has been treated for lung cancer for 15 years. She is happy to be alive – her parents died of lung cancer soon after they found out they had it. She said she is always in pain. She said her mouth always feels like it is burning.</p>
<p>With the help of her doctors, she receives a lower dose of her cancer drug. But she wants drug companies to research low doses when they are developing the treatments.</p>
<p>"No one should have to <strong>endure</strong> avoidable harmful effects of treatment," she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Lillian Siu works on drug development at Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto, Ontario. She said new cancer drugs are more <strong>precise</strong> than in the past. Some newer drugs target a <strong>mutation</strong> that causes cancer cell growth. Others cause the patient's <strong>immune system</strong> to fight the cancer.</p>
<p>Siu says the question is whether patients can get "the same bang for their buck," or useful result, with a lower dose of a drug. "You might only need a low dose to turn off that cancer driver," she said.</p>
<p>An FDA spokesperson said there is a new program called Project Optimus that asks drugmakers to include patients who receive lower doses in their <strong>clinical trials</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes doctors lower doses during the later parts of testing. But other times, lower doses are called for only after the drug is approved and doctors try to reduce their patients' side-effects.</p>
<p>Dr. Patricia LoRusso leads drug research at the Yale Cancer Center in Connecticut. She said the problem with using high doses is that patients start to feel bad, so they have to stop taking the drug. During that time, the cancer starts to come back.</p>
<p>In addition, some patients get results from a low dose, while others only get results from a high dose. That is called patient-to-patient variation. People's liver and kidneys process cancer drugs differently which affects how much of the medicine reaches the cancer cells.</p>
<p>"The challenge is: Where is the sweet spot?" LoRusso said. A "sweet spot" means just the right amount.</p>
<p>One large group of patients has concerns about doses that are too high: women with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of their body. That kind of cancer is very difficult to treat. Without drugs, the cancer might spread even more. So many patients must be on cancer drugs for most of their lives. But they want to be able to enjoy their time, instead of feeling sick.</p>
<p>Dr. Julie Gralow is chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. She is working on a low-dose study of 500 patients who take two kinds of drugs for breast cancer.</p>
<p>She said the study will look at two kinds of treatments. One that starts patients on a low dose that increases if the patient does well. The other starts the patient at a high dose and then lowers if side effects are too difficult.</p>
<p>Lesley Kailani Glenn is a 58-year-old breast cancer patient from Oregon. She has been getting treatment for 11 years. She said she will need the drugs for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>"We want to try to live the best that we can, knowing that treatment is never-ever going to stop," she said. Glenn has hiked California mountains and up high seaside hills in Italy while receiving treatment. She works with her doctor to change the amount of drug she receives based on her ability to tolerate it. She said the number one thing she dislikes is the feeling that she needs to use the bathroom all the time.</p>
<p>She does not want to lose her quality of life.</p>
<p>Project Optimus asks drugmakers to compare the results of different doses. It might sound like a good idea, but the drug companies have concerns. They say carrying out trials of separate doses slows down the development process.</p>
<p>Dr. Alice Shaw leads cancer drug development at Novartis, a Swiss drug company. She said the interest in lowering side effects by testing different doses needs to be weighed against getting a helpful new drug to cancer doctors.</p>
<p>She said it might be better to get the drugs on the market first.</p>
<p>But Dr. Timothy Yap of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas said drug companies might not be seeing the problem correctly. He said they need to take the time early in the process to find the right dose. That way, more patients will be able to use their medicine.</p>
<p>"If the patients are not taking the drug, then it's not going to work," Yap said.</p>

微软表示，来自俄罗斯、朝鲜和伊朗的国家支持的网络攻击者一直在使用其OpenAI工具来欺骗目标并获取信息。</p>
<p>Microsoft said in a report released Wednesday that it had tracked online attackers, or hacking groups, that work with several states. They include Russia's military Intelligence, Iran's Revolutionary Guard, and North Korean governments. The company said the hackers were trying to improve their campaigns using large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Those computer programs use artificial intelligence. They use huge amounts of information on the internet to create human-sounding writing.<br/>
微软在周三发布的一份报告中表示，它已经追踪了与几个国家合作的网络攻击者或黑客组织。其中包括俄罗斯军事情报部门、伊朗革命卫队和朝鲜政府。该公司表示，黑客正试图使用OpenAI旗下的ChatGPT等大型语言模型来改进他们的活动。那些计算机程序使用人工智能。它们利用互联网上的大量信息来创作类似人类的作品。</p>
<p>The company said it would ban state-backed hacking groups from using its AI products. The company said it was not concerned whether any rules had been broken.<br/>
该公司称其将禁止国家支持的黑客组织使用其人工智能产品。该公司表示，它并不关心是否有任何违规行为。</p>
<p>"Independent of whether there's any violation of the law or any violation of terms of service, we just don't…want them to have access to this technology," Microsoft Vice President for Customer Security Tom Burt told Reuters.<br/>
微软负责客户安全的副总裁汤姆·伯特告诉路透社：“无论是否有任何违法行为或违反服务条款的行为，我们都不希望他们能够使用这项技术。”</p>
<p>Russian, North Korean, and Iranian diplomatic officials did not immediately return requests for comment on the claims.<br/>
俄罗斯、朝鲜和伊朗外交官员没有立即回复对这些说法发表评论的请求。</p>
<p>The claims that state-backed hackers have been caught using AI tools to support spying activities is likely to increase concerns about the spread of the technology and its possible abuse. Internet security officials in Western countries have been warning since last year that bad actors were abusing AI tools.<br/>
国家支持的黑客被抓到使用人工智能工具支持间谍活动的这种说法，可能会增加人们对该技术传播及其可能被滥用的担忧。自去年以来，西方国家的互联网安全官员一直警告说，不良行为者正在滥用人工智能工具。</p>
<p>OpenAI and Microsoft described the hackers' use of their AI tools as in an "early-stage" and "incremental." Burt said neither had seen online spies have big successes.<br/>
OpenAI和微软将黑客对其人工智能工具的使用描述为“早期”和“增量”。伯特表示，也没见到网络间谍取得巨大成功。</p>
<p>"We really saw them just using this technology like any other user," he said. The report described hacking groups using large language models in different ways.<br/>
他说：“我们实际上看到他们像其他用户一样使用这项技术。”该报告描述了黑客组织以不同方式使用大型语言模型的情况。</p>
<p>Microsoft said hackers suspected of working for the Russian military spy agency, widely called GRU, used the models. The company said the hackers researched satellite and military technologies that might deal with military operations in Ukraine.<br/>
微软表示，被怀疑为俄罗斯军事间谍机构GRU工作的黑客使用了这些模型。该公司表示，黑客研究了可能应对乌克兰军事行动的卫星和军事技术。</p>
<p>Microsoft said North Korean hackers used the models to create content that could be used to trick area experts into giving up information. Iranian hackers also used the models to write better emails, Microsoft said. The company said the Iranian group aimed to trick feminist leaders to go to a dangerous website.<br/>
微软表示，朝鲜黑客利用这些模型创建了可以用来诱骗地区专家放弃信息的内容。微软表示，伊朗黑客也利用这些模型编写了更好的电子邮件。该公司表示，这个伊朗组织的目的是诱骗女权主义领导人访问一个危险的网站。</p>
<p>Neither Burt nor OpenAI security official Bob Rotsted said how much activity had been found or how many users had been banned. Burt defended the ban on hacking groups although Microsoft's search engine Bing has no such ban. Burt noted that AI was new and a cause for concern.<br/>
伯特和OpenAI安全官员鲍勃·罗斯特德都没有透露发现了多少活动，也没有透露有多少用户被禁止。伯特为禁止黑客组织的禁令进行了辩解，尽管微软的搜索引擎必应没有这样的禁令。伯特指出，人工智能是一种令人担忧的新事物。</p>

<span class="datetime">18 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>Scientists are warning of the possible collapse of an Atlantic Ocean current system that would likely lead to worldwide climate changes.</p>
<p>Researchers identify the ocean system as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). They say the system plays an important part in moving, or circulating, salt and warm water around the world. This process helps control world temperatures, affects carbon dioxide levels and supports worldwide water flows.</p>
<p>The AMOC system brings warm water to northern areas and carries cold water south, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/amoc.html">explains</a>. The circulation also transports nutrients necessary to support many kinds of sea life.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Wind blown waves from Hurricane Florence hit the beach in Emerald Isle N.C., Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018. (AP Photo/Tom Copeland)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-da77-08dc2e73e8f0_cx4_cy2_cw92_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Wind blown waves from Hurricane Florence hit the beach in Emerald Isle N.C., Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018. (AP Photo/Tom Copeland)</span></div>
<p>The process begins as warm and salty surface water flows northward toward Greenland in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Scientists created "a complex climate model" in an effort to <strong>simulate</strong> a possible collapse of the AMOC. The computer model was "able to measure a sudden weakening of the ocean circulation," the team <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/potential-collapse-of-the-atlantic-ocean-circulation-strongly-affects-european-climate">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>The research was led by scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. A study describing their findings recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189">appeared</a> in the publication <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Earth's oceans have depended on the AMOC circulation system – which acts like a <strong>conveyor belt</strong> - to control climate. The system is still operating, but has experienced slowdowns in recent years.</p>
<p>The driver of the conveyor belt sits off the coast of Greenland. As more ice melts here from climate change, more freshwater flows into the North Atlantic and slows the circulation, said Rene van Westen. He is a climate scientist and oceanographer at Utrecht University.</p>
<p>Van Westen told The Associated Press his research on a possible AMOC collapse does suggest "we are heading towards a <strong>tipping point</strong>." He added, however, that while his team found clear evidence the system is moving closer to collapse, "we're not sure how much closer."</p>
<p>In the current system, cold, deeper and fresher water heads south past both Americas and then east past Africa. The system also pushes saltier, warmer ocean water from the Pacific and Indian oceans past the southern tip of Africa. This water flows to and around Florida before continuing up the U.S. East Coast towards Greenland.</p>
<p>The Dutch team simulated 2,200 years of AMOC flow. The researchers added to the model expectations for future human-caused climate change. The results predicted "an <strong>abrupt</strong> AMOC collapse," after 1,750 years.</p>
<p>But the researchers noted it is difficult to provide a realistic date because the process could be influenced by many unknown circulation events. Making a prediction is also difficult because "current observational records are too short" to provide an exact estimation of collapse, the scientists <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/potential-collapse-of-the-atlantic-ocean-circulation-strongly-affects-european-climate">said</a>. The team said more physics-based measuring tools are necessary to create early warning systems.</p>
<p>The team noted one difficult area to predict is around the tip of Africa, where it is difficult to produce realistic estimates of circulation flows. Measurements around that area have a big effect on how much the AMOC slows, the researchers said.</p>
<p>"This value is getting more <strong>negative</strong> under climate change," van Westen said. He added that when the AMOC reaches a certain level, the change does not happen over time, but would be more "<strong>cliff</strong>-like," he added.</p>
<p>Van Westen said an AMOC collapse would mostly affect climate in Europe.</p>
<p>The researchers say a collapse could reduce temperatures in northwestern Europe by 5 to 15 degrees Celsius. Their study predicts the change would also extend Arctic ice much farther south, raise temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere and change worldwide rainfall. Some scientists warned the climate effects could cause worldwide food and water shortages.</p>
<p>In addition, the team said the simulation predicted a possible 100 centimeter rise in European sea levels if the AMOC collapsed.</p>
<p>Van Westen warned that once the collapse happens, the resulting climate effects are nearly impossible to change. Another member of the team, Henk Dijkstra, said staying clear of such a tipping point is necessary to avoid the "<strong>devastating consequences</strong> on climate, society, and the environment."</p>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>Starting this year, six- to twelve-year-olds in California will be required to learn <strong>cursive </strong>handwriting.</p>
<p>The return to handwriting comes after many years in which typing on computer keyboards was taught and handwriting was pushed aside.</p>
<p>Cursive is a kind of handwriting in which all the letters in a word are connected to each other.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A student at Orangethorpe Elementary School practices writing cursive as California grade school students are being required to learn cursive handwriting this year, in Fullerton, California, U.S. January 23, 2024.

(REUTERS/Mike Blake)</span></div>
<p>Assembly Bill 446 requires that handwriting be taught to 2.6 million Californian students in <strong>grades</strong> one through six. And it requires cursive lessons in grades three and above.</p>
<p>Former elementary school teacher Sharon Quirk-Silva supported the bill and California Governor Gavin Newsom signed it into law in October.</p>
<p>Experts say learning cursive improves brain development, reading skills, and hand movement. Some educators also find value in teaching children to read historic documents and family letters from past generations.</p>
<p>Pamela Keller teaches grades four to six at Orangethorpe Elementary School in Fullerton about 50 kilometers southeast of Los Angeles. She said she was already teaching cursive before the law took effect on January 1.</p>
<p>Some children <strong>complain </strong>about the difficulty, but Keller has a ready answer:</p>
<p>"We tell them, well, it's going to make you smarter, it's going to make some connections in your brain, and it's going to help you move to the next level. And then they get <strong>excited</strong> because students want to be smarter. They want to learn," Keller said.</p>
<p>During a recent visit to the school <strong>library</strong>, Keller said one student got excited seeing an image of the U.S. Constitution, written in 1787, saying, "It's cursive!"</p>
<p>Several of Keller's students say the subject was difficult, like the letter Z, but they enjoyed it anyways.</p>
<p>"I love it, because I just feel it's <strong>fancier</strong>...to write, and it's fun to learn new letters," said Sophie Guardia, a 9-year-old in the fourth grade.</p>
<p>In teacher Nancy Karcher's class, her third-grade students said, "It's fun," "Now I can read my mom's writing," and "It's for my secrets."</p>
<p><strong>Cursive coming back</strong></p>
<p>As computers and smart devices grew in popularity, cursive writing was pushed aside. In 2010, the national Common Core education <strong>standards</strong> were published to help students prepare for university. Cursive was left out.</p>
<p>"They stopped teaching kids how to form any letters at all. Teacher colleges are not preparing teachers to teach handwriting," said Kathleen Wright. She is the founder of the Handwriting Collective, a nonprofit group.</p>
<p>But cursive is coming back. California became the 22nd U.S. state to require cursive handwriting and the 14th to pass a cursive teaching bill since 2014, said Lauren Gendill. She is a researcher at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five states have introduced cursive bills so far in 2024.</p>
<p>Leslie Zoroya is project director for reading language arts at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. She said research has shown that learning cursive supports several linked skills that improve childhood development.</p>
<p>Zoroya said, "You're using different<strong> neural</strong> networks when you're doing cursive rather than printing. And so, it's creating those pathways in your brain."</p>
<p>Zoroya said she got the idea from former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>
<p>California's teaching standards always had cursive writing goals, but Quirk-Silva said cursive was not always taught and was weakening.</p>
<p>She said, "The hope of the legislation is that by the time students leave sixth grade, they would be able to read and write it."</p>

            <title>Presidents’ Day in the US  (2024/2/19)</title>

<span class="datetime">18 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>The third Monday of February is known as Presidents' Day in the United States. For nearly 100 years, America honored its first president, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-washington/3714877.html" target="_blank">George Washington</a>, on February 22. That was his birthday. But the date was not a national holiday until 1968.</p>
<p>That year, the U.S. Congress passed a measure known as the <strong>Uniform</strong> Monday Holiday Act. The measure meant that some public holidays would always fall on a Monday. Today, the country honors its first president on the third Monday in February -- and not on Washington's real birthday.</p>
<p>The holiday is now commonly called Presidents' Day. Many say it also honors <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-abraham-lincoln/3884227.html" target="_blank">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s birthday. The nation's 16th president was born on February 12.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A view of the Capitol Dome, Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on June 21, 2014.

(AP Photo/J. David Ake)</span></div>
<p>The federal government, however, still recognizes the holiday as "Washington's Birthday."</p>
<p>The Uniform<strong> </strong>Monday Holiday Act gives workers a three-day weekend. It also gives shops and marketers a chance to have special Presidents' Day sales.</p>
<p><strong>Presidential facts and 'firsts'</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2021, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/joe-biden-oldest/7436052.html" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> made history when he took the oath of office as the 46th president of the United States. At 78 years old, he became the oldest elected president. The man he beat was the previous record holder, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-donald-trump/4188923.html" target="_blank">Donald J. Trump</a>. He took office at the age of 70 in 2017.</p>
<p>Biden and Trump are leading candidates for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations for the 2024 presidential race. They will likely face each other again later this year for the presidency.</p>
<p>As the first billionaire president, Trump replaced <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-john-kennedy/4085635.html" target="_blank">John F. Kennedy</a>, the 35th president, as the richest man to serve as president.</p>
<p>Kennedy still holds the record for the youngest person to be elected president. He was 43 when he took office. Kennedy is also the youngest president to die in office. He was <strong>assassinated </strong>in 1963 in Dallas, Texas. He was 46 years old.</p>
<p>Another presidential assassination put the youngest person in the office of the president. In 1901, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-theodore-roosevelt/3986653.html" target="_blank">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, then the vice president, became president at the age of 42. He took office after <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-william-mckinley/3979185.html" target="_blank">William McKinley</a>, the 25th president, was shot and killed in Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>The first president to die in office, though, was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-william-henry-harrison/3806092.html" target="_blank">William Henry Harrison</a>. The country's ninth president only served 32 days, the shortest time of any president.</p>
<p>Another Roosevelt holds the record for the longest time in office. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-franklin-roosevelt/4046663.html" target="_blank">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> was the 32nd president. He held office for 4,422 days. After his death, the 22nd Amendment was passed. It limited a person to two four-year terms as president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidential relatives</strong></p>
<p>Most Americans know that the two Roosevelts were related. But they may not know exactly how they were related. Here it goes:</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt was also his fifth <strong>cousin</strong> once removed. And Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, was Eleanor's uncle. That makes the two presidents <strong>distant</strong> relatives.</p>
<p>But they were not the first relatives to both serve as president. That title belongs to the Adamses. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/john-adams-biography/3735093.html" target="_blank">John Adams</a> was America's second president. His son, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-john-quincy-adams/3777362.html" target="_blank">John Quincy Adams</a> was elected as the nation's sixth president.</p>
<p>The Bushes are the other father-son presidential <strong>pair</strong>. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-george-hw-bush/4151649.html" target="_blank">George Herbert Walker Bush</a> was elected as the 41st president. His son, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-george-w-bush/4172344.html" target="_blank">George W. Bush</a>, was the country's 43rd president.</p>
<p>Not everyone can run for president.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/p/5613.html" target="_blank">U.S. Constitution</a> says a person must be at least 35 years old. A person must also have lived "within the United States" for at least 14 years. And they must be a "natural-born citizen."</p>
<p>But the meaning of "natural-born citizen" is not exactly clear. People read the rules in different ways.</p>
<p>By some reasoning, the first "natural-born" American president was not George Washington or John Adams. It was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-martin-van-buren/3793825.html" target="_blank">Martin Van Buren</a>, the eighth president. He was born in 1782, six years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>All seven presidents before Van Buren, and William Henry Harrison, the 9th president, technically were not "natural-born" citizens. They were born before 1776 when the American states were still British colonies.</p>

<p>Health officials in the American state of Alaska have known for nine years about a virus causing rare, mild illness. But a recent case that resulted in a man's death has brought new attention to what is being called the Alaskapox virus.</p>
<p>Here's some background on the virus:</p>
<p><strong>What is Alaskapox?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the Alaska Department of Health shows several Alaskapox lesions. (Alaska Department of Health via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-fdcb-08dc2d9ccdae_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by the Alaska Department of Health shows several Alaskapox lesions. (Alaska Department of Health via AP)</span></div>
<p>Alaskapox belongs to the family of orthopoxviruses that can infect animals and humans. These viruses usually cause <strong>lesions</strong>, or pox, on the skin. Some are more dangerous than others.</p>
<p>Smallpox is the best-known member of the orthopoxvirus family. Others include camelpox, cowpox, horsepox and mpox (formerly known as m<i><i>onkey</i></i>pox).</p>
<p>Alaskapox was discovered in 2015 in a woman who lived near Fairbanks, Alaska. It mainly has been found in small mammals, including red-backed voles and shrews. But house animals, such as dogs and cats, can carry the virus, health officials say.</p>
<p>Seven people in Alaska have become infected with it in the last nine years.</p>
<p>People with Alaskapox have developed one or more bumps on the skin. They also experience joint, or muscle pain and <strong>swollen</strong> parts of the body called lymph nodes.</p>
<p>Nearly all patients had <strong>mild</strong> sickness that went away after a few weeks. But people with weak <strong>immune systems</strong> can be at risk of more severe sickness.</p>
<p>Officials believe Alaskapox spreads through contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>There has been no documented case of it spreading from one person to another. But other viruses in the same family can spread when one person comes in contact with another person's lesions.</p>
<p>So, Alaskan health officials are advising anyone with an Alaskapox lesion to cover it with a bandage.</p>
<p><strong>What happened in the latest case?</strong></p>
<p>Alaska health officials say there have been seven people infected with Alaskapox since the virus was discovered. But the latest case represents the first time someone is known to have died from it.</p>
<p>The older man lived on the Kenai Peninsula. He was being treated for cancer and had a suppressed immune system because of the drugs. In September, he found a red sore under his right armpit and saw doctors over the next two months because of tiredness and burning pain. Alaska public health officials said he was hospitalized in November and died last month.</p>
<p>The man lived in a forested area away from any town and did not travel. They said he had been repeatedly <strong>scratched</strong> by a cat that hunted small animals, and one of the scratches was in the area of the man's armpit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself?</strong></p>
<p>Health officials believe that Alaskapox is rare.</p>
<p>That said, wildlife can carry infection risks and should not be kept at home. The best way to keep pets and family members safe is to keep a safe distance and wash your hands after being outdoors.</p>

            <title>What International Students Should Know about SAT and ACT  (2024/2/18)</title>

<span class="datetime">17 February 2024</span><br/>
<p>Several top U.S. universities say they will require <strong>standardized tests</strong> such as the SAT and ACT from <strong>applicants</strong> again. Some of them went "test-optional" during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The schools include Dartmouth College, Georgetown University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Dartmouth College, in New Hampshire, said students from other countries will need to submit results from those tests or "an <strong>equivalent</strong> standardized national exam."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Some American universities are requiring students to send their SAT and ACT scores after a test-optional period. (AP Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/C9BE3B98-640D-4A3D-9E19-C195FCB5F0C5_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Some American universities are requiring students to send their SAT and ACT scores after a "test-optional" period. (AP Photo)</span></div>
<p>Allen Koh is the founder of Cardinal Education, a company that helps students with college preparation, including applications. He said Dartmouth's announcement "only made official what had been ‘<strong>de facto'</strong> true."</p>
<p>He noted that between 80 and 90 percent of students admitted to top universities sent test scores, even when they were not required.</p>
<p>Koh said students who attend international schools that use the "A-level" tests from Great Britain may not need to take the SAT or ACT since those tests are so well known. The tests from India may be useful, too. However, students coming from other countries should take the ACT or SAT.</p>
<p>Andrew Taylor is a vice president at the nonprofit organization that runs the ACT. He said the tests are important for international students because they permit American schools to compare students, even if they come from different educational systems.</p>
<p>In an email message to VOA, a representative from the College Board, which runs the SAT, said the test "plays an important role in helping international students be seen by colleges and universities. Test scores can confirm a student's <strong>grades</strong> or even <strong>demonstrate</strong> their strengths beyond what their high school grades may show."</p>
<p>So if you are an international student planning to apply to college in the U.S., what should you know about the tests?</p>
<p><strong>SAT or ACT?</strong></p>
<p>The SAT has two parts – reading and math. Students can earn a top <strong>score</strong> of 800 for each part, making 1600 a perfect score.</p>
<p>The SAT is an "adaptive" test, which means the questions will change based on a student's answer to the previous question. As a result, the SAT takes less time for most students than the ACT.</p>
<p>The ACT is the same for every student who takes the test on the same day. The ACT has four parts – math, science, English and reading. The top ACT score is 36.</p>
<p>Both tests are now available to be taken with a computer at international testing centers.</p>
<p>For the most part, Koh advises international students to take the ACT "because it is much easier to get a perfect ACT score than a perfect SAT score." Based on how the final ACT score is calculated, Koh said, there are more ways to get to the perfect score of 36.</p>
<p>For English learners, Koh has this advice:</p>
<p>"So I'd say if your English is really strong, all around, ACT could be great for foreigners, but I think for the average foreigner where English might be a little bit of a <strong>liability</strong> and math might be a little bit stronger, then the SAT may be a better test."</p>
<p>Taylor of the ACT added that the ACT has a science section, so for students who may not be strong in science, the SAT could be a better choice.</p>
<p>Both Koh and Taylor say students should take practice tests from both the ACT and SAT to decide which may be better for them.</p>
<p>You can find more information online, such as testing dates and locations of test centers at the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/sat-international-student-guide.pdf">SAT</a> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/Preparing-for-the-ACT.pdf">ACT</a> websites.</p>
<p><strong>When to take the test?</strong></p>
<p>Koh and Taylor suggest that international students take the tests at least one year before finishing high school. If there is room for improvement, Koh said, students can practice and take it again six months later.</p>
<p>Taylor reminded students that most schools will consider a "super score" which is the best score from each test category.</p>
<p>
"So there is no doubt that students do better if they take more than one test. So if they're in a position to be able to take more than one test, we would always <strong>recommend</strong> that and give yourself the time to do some additional learning between tests so you know, think about where you struggle, think about where you can be ready, and go from there."</p>
<p>Arkar Chen of Myanmar took the SAT in 2016, one year after he finished high school. He studied for the test but was still surprised at how difficult the reading part was.</p>
<p>"I'll say that 80 percent of the time, I have no idea what it's asking, but the thing with SAT is that when you practice enough, you kind of see a <strong>pattern</strong> and you kind of know what answer the test maker are looking for."</p>
<p>In addition, Chen said students need to solve math problems quickly because each question has a limited time. "There's no way you could do well without a lot of practice," he said.</p>
<p>Chen said the concept of "critical thinking" was the biggest difference between American tests such as the SAT and the tests he saw growing up in Myanmar. "The SAT," he said, "tests a lot on your critical thinking skills, so I think that's why it can feel hard."</p>
<p><strong>Test is part of the "toolbox"</strong></p>
<p>Taylor of ACT says the test is part of the "toolbox" for colleges to decide about a student's ability to do well in school.</p>
<p>"More and more," Taylor said, "higher ed is worried about <strong>graduation</strong>, not just about admission. ... So we need to give not only the higher education <strong>institution</strong> as much data as we can about the student. We also need to give the student as much data as we can about themselves."</p>
<p>Koh observes that standardized tests favor a well-rounded student. So students who spend a lot of time studying math and engineering would be smart to spend time on reading and discussing books in English before taking the test.</p>
<p>The parents of many international students are surprised to learn, as Koh said, "Asian <strong>STEM-focused</strong> students are <strong>penalized</strong> the heaviest by American admissions officers, for being very strong in math but weak on reading."</p>

<p>And now <em>Words and Their Stories</em>, from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>The third Monday of February is known as Presidents' Day in the United States. So, for today's <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>we look at some of the famous and not-so-famous presidential words and their stories in history.</p>
<p>From <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-theodore-roosevelt/3986653.html">Teddy Roosevelt</a>'s <u>lunatic fringe</u> to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/joe-biden-oldest/7436052.html">Joe Biden</a>'s <u>malarkey</u>, the words and phrases said by U.S. presidents are often as <strong>unique</strong> as the American experience.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden boards his No Malarkey bus following a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa on Nov. 30, 2019.

<p>"We're really creating our own institutions through language," said Paul Dickson. He is the writer of <em>Words from the White House: Words and Phrases Coined or Popularized by America's Presidents</em>. If you coin a word or phrase you create it.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-jefferson/3744095.html">Thomas Jefferson</a>, America's 3rd president, is said to have created more than a hundred words. One of the words is <u>authentication</u> – the act of proving or showing something to be true. Another word from Jefferson is <u>Anglomania</u>. It means to have extreme affection for all things English. The ending -mania means to be crazy about something.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-abraham-lincoln/3884227.html">Abraham Lincoln</a>, the country's 16th president, is known for making powerful speeches during the Civil War. One of his best-known phrases, "<u>A house divided</u> against itself cannot stand," is drawn from the Bible.</p>
<p>Historians note that Teddy Roosevelt, the 26th president, was the first president to use media to connect with the public. And he added several memorable words and phrases to American English.</p>
<p><strong>Creating slang</strong></p>
<p>Dickson says, "Teddy Roosevelt creates this huge body of <strong>slang</strong>." The words include <u>pack rat</u>, <u>loose cannon</u>, <u>lunatic fringe</u>, and <u>bully pulpit</u> – among many others.</p>
<p>A <u>pack rat</u> is someone who collects things that they do not need.</p>
<p>A <u><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/loose-cannons-are-dangerous/4665046.html" target="_blank">loose cannon</a></u> describes a dangerous and uncontrollable person.</p>
<p><u>Lunatic fringe</u> describes people whose opinions are extreme and different from many others. And a <u>bully pulpit</u> is an important position, such as the presidency, that provides a chance to instruct, lead, or inspire others.</p>
<p><strong>Creating slogans</strong></p>
<p>In addition to slang, some presidents created <strong>slogans</strong>. A slogan is a short phrase used in advertising or political campaigns to get attention.</p>
<p><u>America First</u> came from <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-president-woodrow-wilson/4001252.html">Woodrow Wilson</a>, the 28th president, in 1915, and not <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-donald-trump/4188923.html">Donald Trump</a>, the 45th.</p>
<p>The 29th president, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-warren-harding/4018013.html">Warren Harding</a>, gets credit for coming up with the term <u>Founding Fathers</u>. This describes the creators of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Before <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-calvin-coolidge/4027250.html">Calvin Coolidge</a>, the 30th president, no political campaigner had ever called himself a <u>law-and-order</u> candidate. This means they support police efforts and enforcement of laws.</p>
<p>The 33rd president, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-harry-truman/4067702.html">Harry Truman</a>, came up with the phrase <u>do-nothing Congress</u>. He is also famous for the saying, <u>If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen</u>.</p>
<p>Sometimes presidents changed names to better describe their purpose. Dickson says, "It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who changed the name of the ‘Report to Congress' to the <u>State of the Union</u>."</p>
<p><strong>Critics &amp; criticisms</strong></p>
<p>However, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-franklin-roosevelt/4046663.html">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, the 32nd president, brought criticism when he said, "Well, it's pretty <u>iffy</u> as to where the Supreme Court stands on this." <u>Iffy</u> is another way of saying something is uncertain or unknown. His critics felt that the American president should use "<strong>proper</strong>" English.</p>
<p>In 1961, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-dwight-eisenhower/4076083.html">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, the 34th president, was praised for using the term <u>military-industrial complex</u> to warn against the powerful alliance of the military, government, and private corporations.</p>
<p>But then he was criticized for using the word <u>finalize</u> in a speech. By adding -ize, he turned the word "final" into a verb.</p>
<p>Major papers at the time wrote that it was not "proper English" and called the word "meaningless."</p>
<p>Dickson says necessity is the reason presidents continue to create new words.</p>
<p>There was a <u>solid majority</u> from <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-richard-nixon/4107568.html">Richard Nixon</a>, the 37th president. And <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-barack-obama/4181145.html">Barack Obama</a>, the 44th president, used <u>shovel-ready</u> to describe public work projects that were ready to start immediately.</p>
<p>When Joe Biden, the 46th president, ran for the White House in 2019, his campaign slogan was <u>no malarkey</u>. <u>Malarkey</u> is believed to be an expression often used by Irish Americans to describe insincere or meaningless talk.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is <u>no malarkey.</u> I hope you enjoyed this special presidential <em>Words and Their Stories.</em></p>

            <title>Environmentalists Celebrate Return of Rhinos in Central Kenya  (2024/2/18)</title>

<span class="datetime">17 February 2024</span><br/>
<p><strong>Conservationists </strong>in Kenya are celebrating the return of many rhinoceroses to an area where they have not been for many years.</p>
<p>The successful move of 21 eastern black rhinos to a new home will give them space to reproduce and could help increase the population of the highly endangered animals. The effort was Kenya's biggest-ever move of rhinos.</p>
<p>The rhinos were taken from three <strong>parks</strong> that are becoming overpopulated to the private Loisaba Conservancy, a place where poachers killed all the rhinos many years ago.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and capture team pull out a sedated black rhino from the water in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, on Jan. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/86ed91bb-0a1a-47ee-b7a0-664f49bfed3f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and capture team pull out a sedated black rhino from the water in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, on Jan. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga, File)</span></div>
<p>Moving the rhinos required 18 days. Conservationists followed the rhinos using a helicopter. They then shot them with special guns that inject <strong>tranquilizer </strong>into the animals, which weigh hundreds of kilograms. The rhinos then have to be loaded into the back of a truck.</p>
<p>Disaster nearly struck early in the move. A tranquilized rhino fell into a small river. Officials involved with the move held the rhino's head above water with a rope to prevent it from drowning while a drug to undo the tranquilizer took effect. The animal was then released.</p>
<p>Some of the rhinos were taken from Nairobi National Park. They had to travel 300-kilometers. Others came from two parks closer to Loisaba.</p>
<p>Rhinos usually stay by themselves and require large territories. As numbers in three parks have increased, wildlife officials decided to move some of the animals to Loisaba. They hope the rhinos will be happier and more likely to reproduce.</p>
<p>David Ndere is an expert on rhinos at the Kenya Wildlife Service. He said rhino reproduction rates decrease when they are crowded in a territory.</p>
<p>"By removing some animals, we expect that the rhino population in those areas will rise up," Ndere said. "And then we reintroduce that founder population of at least 20 animals into new areas."</p>
<p>Loisaba Conservancy said it has put aside around 25,000 hectares for the new arrivals, which are a mix of males and females.</p>
<p>Kenya has had some success in bringing back black rhinos. The population fell from around 20,000 in the 1970s to below 300 in the 1980s because of poaching, conservationists say. The loss increased fears that the animals might disappear from the country. Kenya now has around 1,000 black rhinos, the third biggest population after South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>There are just over 6,400 wild black rhinos left in the world, all of them are in Africa, the organization Save the Rhino International said.</p>
<p>Tom Silvester is the chief executive officer of Loisaba Conservancy. He said Kenya's plan is to get its black rhino numbers to 2,000 over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>"Once we have 2,000 individuals, we will have established a population that will give us hope that we have brought them back from <strong>extinction</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Kenyan officials say they have moved more than 150 rhinos in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>But not all moves have succeeded. One attempt to move 11 rhinos in 2018 ended with all of the animals dying.</p>
<p>An investigation found 10 of the rhinos died from <strong>stress</strong>, a lack of water and food that was made worse by salt poisoning. The animals could not get used to the salty water in their new home. Another animal was attacked by a lion.</p>
<p>Since then, new guidelines have been created for the capture and moving of rhinos in Kenya. Silvester said officials tested the water quality at Loisaba.</p>

            <title>UN Says One-fifth of Migrating Animals at Risk of Extinction  (2024/2/17)</title>

<p>A new United Nations report says one-fifth of the world's <strong>migrating</strong> animals are at risk of disappearing.</p>
<p>Animals that migrate move from one area to another at different times of the year.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cms.int/sites/default/files/publication/State%20of%20the%20Worlds%20Migratory%20Species%20report_E.pdf">report</a>, called State of the World's Migratory Species, was released February 12. It blames population drops on environmental changes linked to human activities.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Migratory birds fly through the sky of southern Lebanon March 28, 2021. (REUTERS/Aziz Taher)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-b531-08dc2caa5b52_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Migratory birds fly through the sky of southern Lebanon March 28, 2021. (REUTERS/Aziz Taher)</span></div>
<p>The threats the animals face include <strong>habitat</strong> loss, illegal hunting and fishing, pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>Many kinds of migratory animals – including songbirds, sea turtles, whales, sharks and others – move to different environments as the seasons change.</p>
<p>The U.N. report says about 44 percent of migratory <strong>species</strong> around the world are decreasing in population. In addition, about one in five of 1,200 species watched by the U.N. are at risk of becoming extinct, or completely disappearing.</p>
<p>Kelly Malsch was the lead writer of the report. She told The Associated Press, "These are species that move around the <strong>globe</strong>. They move to feed and <strong>breed</strong> and also need stopover sites along the way."</p>
<p>Malsch said any habitat loss or other threats during their trip can make animal populations fall. "Migration is <strong>essential</strong> for some species. If you cut the migration, you're going to kill the species," said Stuart Pimm. He is an <strong>ecologist</strong> at Duke University in North Carolina who was not part of the report.</p>
<p>The researchers examined existing data, including information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List</a>. The list identifies wildlife across the world currently facing threats.</p>
<p>The report was presented at a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cms.int/en/cop14">meeting</a> of the U.N.'s Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Attendees of the gathering are examining proposals for <strong>conservation</strong> measures. They are also working to identify new species of concern.</p>
<p>Susan Lieberman is vice president for international policy at the nonprofit <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.wcs.org/?_gl=1*hnt4lz*_ga*MTM1NDIwODAzNC4xNzA3Nzc0ODY4*_ga_BTX9HXMYSX*MTcwNzc3NDg2OC4xLjAuMTcwNzc3NDg2OC42MC4wLjA.">Wildlife Conservation Society</a>. She told the AP, "One country alone cannot save any of these species."</p>
<p>Lieberman noted that eight South American governments at the meeting are expected to propose the addition of two threatened catfish to the U.N.'s list of species of concern. The catfish live in the Amazon River basin, the world's largest freshwater system. If the habitat there can be saved, the catfish will do well, Lieberman said. "It's about protecting the habitat," she added.</p>
<p>The report found habitat loss affected up to 75 percent of the species studied. The report said this shows a big need for more connectivity between separated <strong>ecosystems</strong>. It urges governments to take steps to avoid harming habitats and migration paths when building dams, pipelines or wind power equipment.</p>
<p>"We need to look at the top levels of government decision-making," said Amy Fraenkel. She is executive secretary of the U.N. Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. Fraenkel told Reuters news agency the goal is to consider the best ways animals and humans can have their needs met. "We all need to survive," Fraenkel added.</p>
<p>She noted the problems migratory animals face are also linked to temperature changes across the planet.</p>
<p>These changes, Fraenkel added, hurt the timing of migrations, cause heat stress and drive increasingly destructive weather-related events.</p>
<p>She said, "The changes that had been already predicted some years ago are now happening."</p>

<p>A group of South Korean <strong>rappers</strong> in their eighties has become popular in their hometown and beyond. The group raps about farm life and bringing energy to a quiet rural area threatened by shrinking population.</p>
<p>The group is called Suni and the Seven princesses. They have become famous in their local area since starting out at a community center last August in Chilgok County. The area is southeast of the capital, Seoul.</p>
<p>"It feels like I'm getting younger...Even if I'm old, I'm <strong>excited</strong>," said 81-year-old Park Jeom-sun of a recent performance at a school. She is the leader of the group and known as Suni.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Park Jeom-sun, 81, the leader of the granny rap group Suni and Seven Princesses, along with members Hong Sun-yeon, 79, and Jeong Du-i, 90, raps on the street in Chilgok, South Korea, February 6, 2024.

(REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon)</span></div>
<p>At first, they had a small fan group of 150 people, but the group's popularity spread. They have been asked to perform in nearby towns and to appear on TV shows. Their videos have gained more than 77,000 views on YouTube.</p>
<p>Their success comes as South Korea is about to become a "super-ageing" country as early as next year. One fifth of the country's population is over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Rural areas like Chilgok are shrinking as young people move away to the cities and fewer of them have children.</p>
<p>Park said, "In the past, it felt like I'm living in a really busy town, but now it's not good. There are no people here anymore."</p>
<p>Park said she and the group feel like they are reliving their youth when they perform in clothes like funny hats and <strong>baggy</strong> pants and wear metal jewelry.</p>
<p>Their songs tell about rural life with lines like: "Picking chili from a chili farm...Picking watermelon from a watermelon farm. So happy to be back home!"</p>
<p>Watermelon and chili are popular crops in the area.</p>
<p>The group members have known each other since they were young. They could not receive an education during the years after the Korean War. In 2016, they all took an adult education class to learn how to read and write the Korean alphabet, Hangul.</p>
<p>Last year, Park came across a rap performance on the internet and the group decided to learn rap from their Hangul teacher. They wanted to form a senior group, rapping about rural life.</p>
<p>Their first performance came at a school play at the same community center where they met for their Hangul classes.</p>
<p><strong>Inspired </strong>by the success of Suni and the Seven Princesses, four other rap groups of older South Koreans have appeared in Chilgok. Some formed with the idea of keeping their minds strong and to not feel alone.</p>
<p>Park's <strong>proud </strong>27-year-old granddaughter, Kang Hye-eun, believes her grandmother is the most famous person of Chilgok.</p>
<p>She said, "I thought only <strong>celebrities</strong> become popular on social media, but my grandmother is there now."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny – a sharp critic of President Vladimir Putin – has reportedly died in a far-northern prison at the age of 47.<br/>
据报道，俄罗斯反对派领袖、普京总统的尖锐批评者阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼在该国一家极北的监狱去世，享年47岁。</p>
<p>Russia's prison agency said Navalny collapsed and died Friday after taking a walk at a prison known as the "Polar Wolf." The prison colony is in the settlement of Kharp, about 1,900 kilometers northeast of Moscow, in Russia's Arctic area.<br/>
俄罗斯监狱管理局表示，纳瓦尔尼星期五在一所名为“极地狼”的监狱散步后昏倒身亡。该监狱位于俄罗斯北极地区的哈尔普定居点，距离莫斯科东北约1900公里。</p>
<p>Prison officials said Navalny fell unconscious almost immediately and was treated by medical workers who attempted to restart his breathing. But they said those efforts were unsuccessful and Navalny died shortly afterwards.<br/>
监狱官员表示，纳瓦尔尼几乎立即陷入昏迷，医护人员对他进行了治疗，试图让他恢复呼吸。但他们表示，这些努力没有成功，纳瓦尔尼不久后去世。</p>
<p>公告称，“2月16日，被关押在第三惩教所的纳瓦尔尼在散步后感觉不适，随即便失去知觉，惩教所医务工作人员立即赶到，并呼叫了医疗急救组。”<br/>
该局表示，“已实施所有必要的抢救措施，但未取得积极效果。急诊医生证实，罪犯已经身亡。目前正在查明死因。”</p>
<p>A Russian government spokesman said President Putin had been informed of the death. Navalny's wife, Yulia, said she could not be sure her husband was dead because "Putin and his government...lie incessantly."<br/>
俄罗斯政府发言人表示，普京总统已被告知这起死亡消息。纳瓦尔尼的妻子尤利娅表示，她不能确定丈夫是否已经死亡，因为“普京和他的政府……不断撒谎。”</p>
<p>Navalny's reported death comes as Putin prepares for an election that could keep him in power until at least 2030.<br/>
纳瓦尔尼的死亡报道正值普京筹备选举之际，这场选举可能会让他至少执政到2030年。</p>
<p>For the past 10 years, Navalny has spoken out publicly and presented evidence of what he described as widespread government corruption. He also organized major anti-government protests and ran for public office.<br/>
在过去的10年里，纳瓦尔尼公开发声，并提供了他所说的政府大范围腐败的证据。他还组织了大规模的反政府抗议活动，并竞选公职。</p>
<p>Navalny had been jailed since January 2021. That is when he returned to Moscow after a stay in Germany. He had been recovering there from a poisoning incident he blamed on Russia's government. Since then, he has received three prison sentences. Navalny has denounced them all as political.<br/>
纳瓦尔尼自2021年1月以来一直被监禁。那是他在德国停留后返回莫斯科的时候。他一直在德国从一起中毒事件中康复，他将该事件归咎于俄罗斯政府。从那时起，他已被判处三次有期徒刑。纳瓦尔尼谴责它们都是政治性的判决。</p>
<p>Western leaders and others who have opposed Putin's rule praised Navalny. The opposition leader's health had worsened recently. The true cause of death might never be known. Some world leaders said they hold Russian officials responsible.<br/>
西方领导人和其他反对普京统治的人士赞扬了纳瓦尔尼。这位反对党领袖的健康状况最近有所恶化。死亡的真正原因可能永远都不会揭晓。一些世界领导人表示，他们认为俄罗斯官员应对此负责。</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, if confirmed, Navalny's death "underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built. Russia is responsible for this." Blinken was speaking while attending a security conference in Germany.<br/>
美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯表示，如果得到证实，纳瓦尔尼的死“突显了普京建立的政府体系核心的弱点和腐朽。俄罗斯对此负有责任。”布林肯是在德国出席一次安全会议时发表上述讲话的。</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters at the same conference that Navalny "has probably now paid for this courage with his life."<br/>
德国总理奥拉夫·朔尔茨在同一次会议上告诉记者，纳瓦尔尼“现在可能已经为这种勇气付出了生命的代价”。</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – standing by Scholz's side – said, "Putin doesn't care who dies in order for him to hold onto his position."<br/>
站在朔尔茨身边的乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基说：“为了保住他的位置，普京不在乎谁会死去。”</p>
<p>Russian Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov told Reuters news agency he considers Navalny's death "murder" because prison conditions caused his death. Muratov runs a pro-democracy newspaper. He shared the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in support of freedom of expression in Russia.<br/>
俄罗斯诺贝尔和平奖得主德米特里·穆拉托夫告诉路透社，他认为纳瓦尔尼的死是“谋杀”，因为监狱条件导致了他的死亡。穆拉托夫经营着一家亲民主的报纸。他因支持俄罗斯言论自由的工作而获得2021年诺贝尔和平奖。</p>
<p>Yulia Navalny said, if her husband is in fact dead, Putin, and those around him "will be punished for what they have done to our country, for what they have done to my family, for what they have done to my husband."<br/>
尤利娅·纳瓦尔尼说，如果她的丈夫真的死了，普京和他周围的人“终将因他们对我们国家的所作所为、对我的家人的所作所为和对我丈夫的所作所为而受到惩罚。”</p>

<p>Hello! Welcome to <em>Ask a Teacher</em>. This week, we answer a question that relates not just to language, but also <strong>politeness</strong> and foreign policy. It comes from Hai in Vietnam. He writes,</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>I would highly appreciate it if you could let me know the meaning of this phrase: "It sure as heck ain't good."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher - Sure As Heck" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-9f75-08dc2d7b39a2_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher - Sure As Heck</span></div>
<p><u>Hai</u>, Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Dear Hai,</p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us and providing a link to the place where you read the sentence. The quote that you asked about is from a January 31 press conference at the White House. The Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, invited spokesman John Kirby to answer questions from reporters. One reporter said the European Union had recently offered to give Ukraine only half of what it had been promised. The reporter asked:</p>
<p><em>How bad is all this for the Ukrainian forces and do you see an <strong>impact</strong> on the battlefield already?</em></p>
<p>Kirby gave this answer:</p>
<p><em>It sure as heck ain't good. And this is why we need the <strong>supplemental </strong>funding.</em></p>
<p>There are three things an English learner needs to know to understand Kirby's answer. The first one has to do with the language that Kirby used.</p>
<p><strong>Heck</strong></p>
<p>"Heck" is in the class of words called euphemisms. They are words or expressions people use instead of saying something that might be offensive or could sound uneducated. "Heck" is a euphemism for the word "hell." Kirby, like most government officials, is trying to use more formal language, but he also wants to bring attention to the serious nature of the problem. So, he uses "heck" instead of "hell," a word that is much stronger. "Hell," in many religions, is a very unpleasant place where bad people go.</p>
<p><strong>Ain't</strong></p>
<p>The second thing learners need to know is the short form, "ain't." The <strong>contraction</strong> "ain't" is usually a short form of "am not," but it can also mean "is not" or "are not" as well as "have not" or "has not." In our example, Kirby could have said, "It is not good."</p>
<p>Like most informal contractions, we must tell you it is best to avoid "ain't" in all writing for school or work and in speech. For more information, see our <em>Everyday Grammar</em> on this subject,<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/this-aint-it-and-other-short-forms/5854271.html"> This Ain't It and Other Short Forms.</a></p>
<p><strong>Supplemental</strong></p>
<p>Kirby said: "It sure as heck ain't good. And this is why we need the supplemental funding." The United States Congress must approve all spending by the U.S. government. A supplemental funding request can be made to ask Congress to approve additional spending that has not been provided for in earlier spending legislation.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand Kirby's comments, Hai.</p>

        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Economists Wonder If Few or Many Will Benefit from AI  (2023/8/11)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">10 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Throughout history, technological progress has brought new wealth but has not always improved people's lives. Economists now say it is not clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) will help or hurt society.</p>
<p>Simon Johnson teaches economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology near Boston. He said AI has a lot of possibilities. But he added, "We are at a fork in the road." A fork in the road is an expression used to describe a situation where the <strong>outcome</strong> is uncertain.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An AI (Artificial Intelligence) sign is seen at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China July 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/aa9b225a-fb1a-48ca-84e5-f493a15b741f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An AI (Artificial Intelligence) sign is seen at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China July 6, 2023.

<p><strong>Wealth, jobs and productivity</strong></p>
<p>McKinsey is a business <strong>consulting</strong> company. It said AI could add between $14 trillion and $22 trillion of value to the world's economy.</p>
<p>Supporters say the technology will create wealth and improve living <strong>standards</strong>. Some go as far as saying AI will increase people's free time and help them be more creative.</p>
<p>But others are worried the technology will lead to lost jobs. They point to Hollywood writers and actors who are worried that they will be replaced by technology.</p>
<p>The internet arrived with a similar promise of more productivity, wealth and jobs. Last month, the French bank Natixis noted in its research that most of the wealth has gone to a few billionaires. And many of the jobs do not require highly paid, skilled workers.</p>
<p>The bank warned in its report, "We should be <strong>cautious</strong> when estimating the effects of artificial intelligence on labor productivity."</p>
<p>In July, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released its opinion research of 5,300 workers about AI. Some workers hope the technology will increase pay and job satisfaction. But they are also concerned that the technology could push people to work too hard.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons from history</strong></p>
<p>Such concerns are not unfounded. History has shown the economic impact of technological progress is generally uncertain, unequal and even harmful.</p>
<p>Johnson recently published a book, <em>Power and Progress,</em> with Daron Acemoglu, another economist from MIT. They studied technological progress over the last 1,000 years including clothing production, train travel, and even food shopping.</p>
<p>The two economists looked at an invention called the spinning jenny that made it easier to turn cotton and wool into <strong>yarn</strong>. They said the device helped clothing production and created wealth for many people in the late 1700s. However, it also increased the demand for cotton and led to longer hours for workers. The demand also led to the growth of slavery in the southern United States.</p>
<p>Johnson noted that it is easier to create something new than to make sure it works for everyone. His book shows how the arrival of rail travel improved the lives of many people in England in the 1800s. People were able to travel longer distances and eat fresh food because it could move faster from farms to cities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Johnson said <strong>self-checkout</strong> technology at food stores does not lower the cost or make life easier for people. All it does is reduce the number of workers and help businesses lower labor costs.</p>
<p>As for AI technology, Johnson wonders if it will make existing inequalities worse, or "could it help us get back to something fairer?"</p>

            <title>Schools Lost Track of Homeless Kids during Pandemic  (2023/8/11)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">10 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, many schools struggled to keep a count of students whose families struggled with homelessness.</p>
<p>The number of children identified as homeless by schools nationwide dropped by 21 percent from the 2018-2019 school year to the 2020-2021 school year, federal data found. That decrease represented more than 288,000 students.</p>
<p>But it is likely there were many students whose schools did not know they were homeless.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Aaliyah Ibarra and fellow students work on their computers during the last week of classes at Frye Elementary School in Chandler, Ariz., Tuesday, May 23, 2023. (AP Photo/Darryl Webb)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-79fa-08db98dfa18b_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Aaliyah Ibarra and fellow students work on their computers during the last week of classes at Frye Elementary School in Chandler, Ariz., Tuesday, May 23, 2023.

<p>By the time Aaliyah Ibarra started second grade, her family had moved five times in four years in search of housing. As she was about to start a new school, her mother, Bridget Ibarra, saw how much it was affecting Aaliyah's education.</p>
<p>At 8 years old, Aaliyah did not know the alphabet. Her family's struggles came during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Aaliyah to begin school online.</p>
<p>Online school was especially hard for Aaliyah because she was homeless. And, like thousands of other students across the country, her school did not know.</p>
<p>By not being identified as homeless, such students lose out on important support like transportation, clothes-cleaning services and other help.</p>
<p>Two years later, the effects have worsened. Students nationwide have struggled to make up for missed learning. And educators have lost important time identifying who needs the most help.</p>
<p>Schools are offering services like <strong>tutoring</strong> and counseling. But schools now have limited time left to spend federal pandemic assistance money for homeless students, said Barbara Duffield. She is director of SchoolHouse Connection, a national homelessness organization.</p>
<p>Many education leaders, Duffield said, do not even know about federal money meant to support homeless students. The federal support ends next year.</p>
<p>In Bridget Ibarra's case, she chose not to tell the school her children were homeless. She said that teachers never asked. She was worried if officials knew the family was staying in a shelter, the family would face pressure to attend a different school that was closer to the shelter.</p>
<p>The <strong>stigma</strong> that comes with homelessness also can lead families not to tell anyone they do not have housing, Duffield said.</p>
<p>If schools cannot identify homeless children, "we can't <strong>ensure</strong> that they have everything they need to be successful in school and even go to school," Duffield added.</p>
<p>Aaliyah's school is in Phoenix, Arizona. It continued with online learning for her whole <strong>kindergarten</strong> year. Aaliyah and her older brother spent most of their school days on computers in a temporary classroom at the shelter.</p>
<p>While the shelter helped the family meet their basic needs, Ibarra said she often asked the school for extra help for her daughter. She felt the school was giving all its attention to Aaliyah's older brother because he is a special education student. That means he has been identified as needing extra educational support.</p>
<p>The school's principal, Sean Hannafin, said school officials met often with the children's mom. He said they offered the support they had available. But he said it was hard to know online which students required more help.</p>
<p>There is a federal law aimed at making sure homeless students have equal <strong>access</strong> to education. The law provides rights and services to children without a "fixed, regular and <strong>adequate</strong> nighttime <strong>residence</strong>."</p>
<p>Many students are not identified as homeless when they sign up for school. At school, teachers or other school workers often notice students who may be dealing with difficulties at home. But with children learning online, teachers often could not see signs of problems.</p>
<p>Overall, the drop in the student homelessness count began before the pandemic. But it became greater when the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The percentage of enrolled students identified as homeless in the U.S. dropped from 2.7 percent in 2018-2019 to 2.2 percent in 2020-2021. Over that time, Arizona had one of the biggest drops in the number of students identified as homeless.</p>
<p>Eventually, Bridget Ibarra had to send Aaliyah to a different school after moving to find new housing. At Aaliyah's new school, Frye Elementary, Principal Alexis Cruz Freeman saw how hard it was to communicate with families when children were not in classrooms.</p>
<p>Aaliyah has improved at her new school, Cruz Freeman said. She still has trouble saying and reading some words. But by the end of the school year, she was able to read a <strong>text</strong> and write four sentences based on its meaning. She is also performing at her grade level in math.</p>
<p>Cruz Freeman considers Aaliyah a success story in part because of her mother's support. "She was an <strong>advocate</strong> for her children, which is all that we can ever ask for," Cruz Freeman said.</p>

            <title>DNA of Enslaved Iron Workers Gives Light to African American History  (2023/8/11)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/dna-of-enslaved-iron-workers-gives-light-to-african-american-history.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">10 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Not far from Camp David, a U.S. presidential base in Maryland, lie the remains of an iron workshop called Catoctin Furnace. The workshop dates back to the late 18th century. It is an important place for understanding the start of the Industrial Revolution in early U.S. history.</p>
<p>The site is also providing researchers with a greater understanding of African American history. A new study examined <strong>DNA</strong> from the remains of 27 individuals found in a burial place at Catoctin Furnace for enslaved people.</p>
<p>The study <strong>revealed</strong> the ancestry of some of the enslaved people who were forced to work there in the years after the nation's founding. It also identified thousands of living relatives. Many of the relatives still live in Maryland.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A view of the site of the Catoctin Furnace, an iron forge where enslaved people of African descent once worked, in Cunningham Falls State Park in Maryland, U.S., in this undated photograph.

<p>The burial site was used from 1774 to 1850. The remains were removed from the site in the 1970s so that a road could be built. Since then, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. has kept the remains. They include 16 males and 11 females. Some are very young children, while others are older adults.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the 27 individuals <strong>descended from</strong> just a few African populations, mainly West Africa's Wolof and Mandinka peoples and Central Africa's Kongo people. And they have strong genetic connections to present-day populations in Senegal, Gambia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Millions of people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas from the 16th to 19th century in the transatlantic slave trade. A lack of documentation about these people has left descendants with little information about their own family history.</p>
<p>Kari Bruwelheide is a researcher with the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. She helped write the study, which appeared last week in the publication <em>Science. </em></p>
<p>Bruwelheide said, "This knowledge was <strong>severed</strong> by slavery – a truth that has implications for African Americans far beyond the community of Catoctin Furnace."</p>
<p>She added that the study shows the power of genetic research to rebuild some of what was destroyed by a lack of record-keeping.</p>
<p>Enslaved people of African descent were forced to work in agricultural, industrial, and home settings in parts of the United States. Slavery ended with the U.S. Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865.</p>
<p>Catoctin Furnace is a few kilometers from Camp David in Cunningham Falls State Park. It grew into a village area, with industrial buildings and housing.</p>
<p>Workers mined iron, kept fires burning to melt the iron and made different kinds of goods. The goods they made included stoves, pots and even cannon balls. Enslaved people were the main part of the work force until paying European immigrants to work there became less costly by the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers examined historical DNA alongside genetic testing company 23andMe's personal ancestry database. Through their efforts, they identified 41,799 Americans related to the 27 individuals.</p>
<p>Eadaoin Harney was the lead study writer. She is also a 23andMe population geneticist. She said, "Enslaved African Americans are largely excluded from the historical record, and in documents where they are <strong>mentioned</strong>, they are often treated as property, not as people."</p>
<p>The study found some European ancestry in most of the 27 individuals. That finding supports records of sexual abuse of enslaved people by their enslavers and others. It found that some of the 27 had possible genes for genetic conditions like sickle cell anemia and G6PD <strong>deficiency</strong>. Genetic conditions involving red blood cell problems are still common among African Americans.</p>
<p>Kathryn Barca is a Smithsonian researcher and a writer of the study. She said, "The experiences of African Americans within the early industrial complex of the United States are not completely understood and their labors in this system have not been <strong>thoroughly</strong> explored or acknowledged."</p>
<p>Barca added, "We hope this paper gives voice to these 27 individuals..."</p>

<p><strong>Group of verbs </strong></p>
<p>Let's start with the verb "clean."</p>
<p>We can think of "clean" as a kind of general term for many activities. For example, a person might say:</p>
<p><em>"I am cleaning my house."</em></p>
<p>Aside from "clean," we can use a number of more exact verbs. For example, we have "sweep," "vacuum," "wash," and "dust."</p>
<p>Let's explore each of these in turn.</p>
<p>We use the verb "sweep" when we remove dust or dirt with a <strong>broom</strong>.<br/>
We use "vacuum" when we clean something with a special device known as a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>We use "wash" when we clean something with water and soap.</p>
<p>We use "dust" when we make something clean by wiping the surface, often with cloth.</p>
<p>So, we have a group of verbs. "Clean" is the widest in meaning; the others describe more exact activities - "sweep," "vacuum," "dust," and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Important </strong></p>
<p>You might be asking yourself how this discussion connects with grammar.</p>
<p>The question leads us to an important point. We have a group of verbs. These verbs are interesting because all of them can be used in a transitive or an intransitive sense.</p>
<p>Transitive means to take a direct object. Intransitive means to not take a direct object.</p>
<p>What this means is that the verbs we have explored – clean, sweep, dust, and so on - have some sense of flexibility in how they can be used.</p>
<p>Let's clarify.</p>
<p>Think back to the sentence you heard earlier:</p>
<p><em>"I am cleaning my house."</em></p>
<p>In the example, we have the subject, "I," the present progressive form "am cleaning," and the object, "my house." In this sentence, we can say that the verb "clean" is followed by an object.</p>
<p>But we could also say:</p>
<p><em>"I am cleaning."</em></p>
<p>In this example, we do not have an object.</p>
<p>Now, let us take some of the other verbs we explored earlier. They all follow the same general idea.</p>
<p>The verb "sweep" might be used with an object, as in:</p>
<p><em>"She swept the floor."</em></p>
<p>Or without an object, as in:</p>
<p><em>"She swept."</em></p>
<p>The same idea is true of "vacuum," where a person might say:</p>
<p><em>"I vacuumed the living room."</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>"I vacuumed."</em></p>
<p>The main difference between the statements is in the amount of shared information. If the speaker and listener both know what is being discussed, then the object is not necessary. If the listener does not know what is being discussed, then the speaker might need to include the object.</p>
<p><strong>Practice </strong></p>
<p>Let's take some time to work with these ideas.</p>
<p>Make a sentence using the present progressive form of the verb "dust." Be sure to use the object, "the <strong>bookshelf</strong>."</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one answer:</p>
<p><em>"I am dusting the bookshelf."</em></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts </strong></p>
<p>Today, you learned a few basic ideas that are important for talking about cleaning. You learned some related verbs and how to use them with or without an object. The next step will be to develop more complex sentences that involve adverbs and prepositions. But that will have to be the subject of a future report.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A major American game maker has banned designers from using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create artwork for its games.<br/>
美国一家大型游戏制造商禁止设计师使用人工智能工具为其游戏创作插图。</p>
<p>The company, Wizards of the Coast, owns the product collection for the popular game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D). The role-playing game, set in an imaginary world, was first launched in 1974.<br/>
这家名为“海岸奇才”的公司拥有热门游戏《龙与地下城》的产品系列。这款角色扮演游戏设定在一个虚构的世界，于1974年首次推出。</p>
<p>Toy manufacturer Hasbro is the parent company of Wizards of the Coast and the related company D&amp;D Beyond. Officials at D&amp;D Beyond said they did not find out until recently that one of its artists used AI to create artwork for an upcoming book. The company said in a statement it had talked to the artist involved.<br/>
玩具制造商孩之宝公司是海岸奇才公司和关联公司D&amp;D Beyond的母公司。D&amp;D Beyond公司的官员表示，他们直到最近才发现，该公司的一位艺术家使用人工智能为一本即将出版的书籍创作了插图。该公司在声明中称已与相关艺术家进行了交谈。</p>
<p>D&amp;D Beyond said the artist – who had worked for the company for more than 10 years – had agreed to no longer use AI tools for artistic designs. The company said it is also examining its current AI rules.<br/>
D&amp;D Beyond公司表示，这位在该公司工作了10多年的艺术家已同意不再使用人工智能工具进行艺术设计。该公司称其也在审查目前的人工智能规则。</p>
<p>Some D&amp;D fans discovered the AI-developed art in the series.<br/>
一些D&amp;D爱好者在该系列中发现了人工智能开发的插图。</p>
<p>Hasbro bought D&amp;D Beyond for $146.3 million last year. The Rhode Island-based toy company has owned Wizards of the Coast for more than 20 years.<br/>
去年，孩之宝公司以1.463亿美元收购了D&amp;D Beyond公司。这家总部位于罗德岛州的玩具公司拥有海岸奇才公司已经20多年了。</p>
<p>The AI artwork in question was part of a soon-to-be-released book of creature descriptions and lore called Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants. The digital and physical versions of the game are set for release August 15.<br/>
存在问题的人工智能插图是即将出版的一本名为《Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants》的生物描述和传说书籍的一部分。该游戏的数字版和实体版定于8月15日发布。</p>
<p>The use of AI tools to assist with creative work has raised copyright and labor concerns across a number of industries. The issue is part of what is fueling the current Hollywood strike. It also led the music industry organization, the Recording Academy, to change the rules of its Grammy Awards process.<br/>
使用人工智能工具协助创造性工作引起了许多行业对版权和人工的担忧。这个问题是助长当前好莱坞罢工的部分原因。它还导致音乐产业组织“唱片学院”改变了格莱美颁奖程序的规则。</p>
<p>Some artists have brought legal action against AI companies for using their work without permission.<br/>
一些艺术家对人工智能公司未经许可使用其作品提起法律诉讼。</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that Hasbro competitor Mattel had used AI-created images to help come up with ideas for a new Hot Wheels toy car. The news agency noted, however, that Mattel has not said exactly how it is using AI in product development.<br/>
美联社报道称，孩之宝公司的竞争对手美泰公司使用人工智能创建的图像来帮助想出设计新的风火轮玩具车的构思。然而，该通讯社指出，美泰没有确切说明它在产品开发中如何使用人工智能。</p>

<span class="datetime">09 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>The players who reached the <strong>knockout</strong> round of the Women's World Cup received larger individual <strong>bonuses</strong> than those of the past. The increased earnings can be life-changing for many of the players.</p>
<p>FIFA, the world's soccer organizing body, pays $30,000 for the 732 players among 32 teams in the 2023 World Cup. The amount rises to $60,000 for players on the 16 teams that <strong>advance</strong> out of group play.</p>
<p>The amount grows to $90,000 for players in the <strong>quarterfinals</strong>. That is a major payday, especially for the many players who have had pay disputes with their soccer organizations.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Jamaican players celebrate at the end of the Women's World Cup soccer match between Panama and Jamaica in Perth, Australia, Saturday, July 29, 2023. Jamaica won 1-0. (AP Photo/Gary Day)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-84e9-08db9080e5ed_cx6_cy1_cw80_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Jamaican players celebrate at the end of the Women's World Cup soccer match between Panama and Jamaica in Perth, Australia, Saturday, July 29, 2023.

<p>Hildah Magaia is on South Africa's team, and was a big part of its advance out of group play into the knockout round. The team calls Magaia "Breadwinner." The term is often used to describe someone who earns the money needed to support their family.</p>
<p>The South African players doubled their payout. Magaia says she plans to use the money to care for her mother.</p>
<p>"I'll be able to do everything for my mother because I'm the one who's taking care of her," she said. "I'm the breadwinner, so I'll be doing everything for my mom."</p>
<p>Deneisha Blackwood plays for Jamaica. It lost to Colombia in the knockouts. She said the <strong>minimum</strong> pay was a good start for her team, which has had serious financial difficulties.</p>
<p>"A lot of us have bills to pay and family to take care of," Blackwood said, "and I think for the younger generation, especially, football doesn't make you a lot of money. So for (girls) to see us doing what we love and realize that you can make a living off it — it's <strong>motivational</strong>."</p>
<p>In June, FIFA said it would provide $110 million in prize money for players of the Women's World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the money would be sent to soccer's governing bodies, called federations. They would be responsible for awarding it. Infantino said he could not guarantee that the money would reach the players.</p>
<p>FIFPRO is an organization that represents international players. The organization said late Tuesday that it was assisting Nigeria's national team players in a dispute with their federation concerning earnings dating back as far as 2021.</p>
<p>"The team is extremely <strong>frustrated</strong> that they've had to <strong>pursue</strong> the Nigeria Football Federation for these payments before and during the <strong>tournament</strong>," FIFPRO said. "It is regrettable that players needed to <strong>challenge</strong> their own federation at such an important time in their careers."</p>
<p>Before the World Cup, South African players boycotted a game against Botswana because bonuses were not included in their contracts. Patrice Motsepe, president of the African Football Confederation, agreed to give $320,000 to the players to be divided equally. The dispute was settled.</p>
<p>Nigerian player Uchenna Kanu said the money was not the team's main goal --- playing well was.</p>
<p>"But of course, if we get paid that much money, of course, it'll have a huge<strong> impact</strong> on our lives," Kanu said. "We have families, we have things to take care of with money. That's important for us as well."</p>
<p>The total prize money at this Women's World Cup is more than three times the $30 million that was paid out at the 2019 Women's World Cup in France. But it is still far less than the $440 million in prize money for the Men's World Cup in Qatar last year.</p>

<p>Representatives of nations with rainforests in Asia and Africa joined leaders from eight Amazon-area countries for a meeting in Brazil on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The nations will produce a statement called "United for our Forests" to be presented at COP 28 in November. COP 28 is the United Nations climate change conference and it will be held in the Middle Eastern city of Dubai.</p>
<p>The eight South American countries, known as the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO), opened the meeting on Tuesday.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Leaders pose for a group photo during the Amazon Summit at the Hangar Convention Center in Belem, Brazil, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/65164352-e4ad-40fc-a268-94f9ab9f9755_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Leaders pose for a group photo during the Amazon Summit at the Hangar Convention Center in Belem, Brazil, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)</span></div>
<p>The ACTO includes Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. The nations agreed to work on developing their economies without harming the rainforest to a "point of no return."</p>
<p>Representatives also came from the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia and the French territory of Guiana. The president of Norway, a contributor to the Amazon fund for <strong>sustainable</strong> development, also joined.</p>
<p>Scientists say when 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon rainforest is destroyed, it will reduce rainfall and change the environment. The land will get drier and many kinds of plants and animals will die out.</p>
<p>Some environmental activists, however, criticized Tuesday's event, saying the countries did not create a plan with clear goals and <strong>deadlines</strong>.</p>
<p>Brazil's president is Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva. In his third term as leader, he is working to save the Amazon. A study last month showed his efforts caused a 42 percent drop in <strong>deforestation</strong> in only seven months.</p>
<p>The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India. Two-thirds of it lies in Brazil, with seven other countries and French Guiana sharing the remaining third.</p>
<p>Until recently, critics say South American governments saw the rainforest as a resource for materials they could use to grow their economies. Trees were cleared for cattle, companies drilled for oil and mined the land for minerals and metals, and cities and roads were built through the forest. <strong>Indigenous</strong> people lost their land and plants and animals became <strong>endangered</strong>.</p>
<p>All the Amazon nations signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement to reduce pollution. But experts say the countries have had problems working together. They say the latest agreement should require all nations to end deforestation by 2030. So far, only Brazil and Colombia agreed on that deadline.</p>
<p>The nations are also divided on oil drilling in the Amazon. Colombian leader Gustavo Petro called for an end to oil exploration but other nations are not sure they want to follow.</p>
<p>The ACTO meeting, however, did receive support from one Indigenous leader, Fany Kuiru of Colombia. Kuiru praised the group for recognizing the rights of native people to traditional lands and opening a way for indigenous people to participate.</p>
<p>In a discussion on Tuesday, da Silva said the Amazon is a "passport to a new relationship with the world" where its resources can be "valued and put in the service of everyone."</p>

<p>A wave of violence is increasingly affecting American hospitals and medical centers.</p>
<p>Recent attacks at such places make health care one of the nation's most violent industries. Data shows American health care workers experience more non-deadly injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession -- including law enforcement.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Northside Hospital Midtown where a man killed one and wounded four on May 3, 2023. (Arvin Temkar/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4f3a-08db98487e0e_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Northside Hospital Midtown where a man killed one and wounded four on May 3, 2023.

<p>Michael D'Angelo is a former police officer. He now works as a security adviser in Florida. His work centers on health care and workplace violence. He said, "health care workers don't even think about" risks to their safety when they decide to become a nurse or doctor.</p>
<p>But, he added, "health care is four or five times more dangerous than any other profession."</p>
<p>Several mass shootings have taken place in hospitals across the country.</p>
<p>In June of last year, a gunman killed his doctor and three other people at a medical office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The gunman said he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.</p>
<p>In October of last year, a man killed two workers at a hospital in Dallas, Texas, while he was there for his child's birth.</p>
<p>This past May, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, Georgia. One woman died and four other people were wounded.</p>
<p>And late last month, a gunman shot and killed a security guard at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland, Oregon. Police later shot and killed the suspect, who was at the hospital for his child's birth.</p>
<p>Hospitals and medical centers are trying to create a safer environment for workers.</p>
<p>Legacy Health said it plans to add more metal detectors at all of its medical centers. It also plans to require bag searches at every hospital and send patients and visitors to controlled entrances. Legacy Health also said it will provide more officers with <strong>stun</strong> <strong>guns</strong> and will add protective measures from bullets to some glass at main entrances.</p>
<p>The American Nurses Association says around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing punishment for violence against health care workers. And some states, including Indiana, Ohio, and Georgia, let hospitals create their own police forces.</p>
<p>Critics say private hospital police can worsen the health care and policing inequalities already experienced by Black people. They also say private police forces often do not have to release information such as how often they use force or if they detain members of a minority group more often.</p>
<p>Deborah Burger is a registered nurse and president of National Nurses United. She said security teams cannot change the reasons leading to violence. Many of the reasons exist because of the country's problematic health care system, she said.</p>
<p>Patients and families are often <strong>frustrated</strong> by high medical bills, limited treatment choices and long wait times.</p>
<p>"Hospitals don't really have a <strong>complaints</strong> department, so the only real target they have is the nurse or <strong>staff</strong> that are standing right in front of them," she said.</p>
<p>Worker shortages mean nurses are forced to care for more patients. That means less time to examine each one for behavior problems. Burger said efforts to calm an aggressive patient are not as effective if nurses have not been able to spend enough time to build a relationship with patients.</p>
<p>Some hospitals tell their staff to try to make peace with aggressive visitors and patients. Hospital leaders want to avoid getting bad <strong>reviews</strong> from patients, Burger said. That is because the Affordable Care Act has tied part of federal repayment rates to patient <strong>satisfaction</strong> <strong>survey</strong> results. Low satisfaction means less money for the hospitals.</p>
<p>D'Angelo, the former police officer, said, "The results of those surveys should never take <strong>priority</strong> over staff safety."</p>

<p>Niger's military rulers have rejected the latest diplomatic attempt to return to power the country's ousted president.</p>
<p>The <strong>coup</strong> leaders refused to meet with a delegation of West African, African Union and United Nations representatives. In a letter Tuesday, the new rulers said a "climate of threatened aggression" made it impossible to hold talks on ending the constitutional crisis in Niger.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mohamed Toumba, one of the soldiers who ousted Nigerian President Mohamed Bazoum, addresses supporters of Niger's ruling junta in Niamey, Niger, Sunday, Aug. 6, 2023.

(AP Photo/Sam Mednick)</span></div>
<p>The crisis began on July 26, when members of the presidential guard seized control of the government. They detained and continue to hold the democratically-elected leader of Niger, President Mohamed Bazoum and his family.</p>
<p>The West African political and economic organization, ECOWAS, threatened military intervention in Niger unless Bazoum was returned to power by August 6. ECOWAS stands for Economic Community of West African States.</p>
<p>Earlier, a top U.S diplomatic official visited Niger to urge the military rulers to restore the democratically elected Bazoum to power.</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said she traveled to the capital Niamey "to express <strong>grave</strong> concern at the undemocratic attempts to seize power and urged a return to constitutional order." She made the comment on the social media site X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>Nuland told reporters in a conference call Monday that she met with Niger's self-appointed ruler Brigadier General Moussa Salaou Barmou and three other military officials during her visit. She described the talks as "extremely <strong>frank</strong> and at times, quite difficult."</p>
<p>She said the military officials are "quite firm" on how they plan to move forward and those plans do not "<strong>comport</strong> with the constitution of Niger." She said the officials refused her request to meet directly with ousted President Bazoum and his family, as well as coup leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani.</p>
<p>ECOWAS leaders are preparing for a meeting Thursday to discuss their situation with Niger's ruling military.</p>
<p>Niger is the world's seventh-biggest producer of uranium. Uranium is the most widely used fuel for nuclear energy, adding to its importance.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt that diplomacy is the best way to resolve this situation," American Secretary of State Antony Blinken told French radio station RFI.</p>
<p>He said the United States was backing ECOWAS efforts to bring order. He declined to comment on the future of about 1,100 U.S. troops in Niger. French, German and Italian troops are also present in the country.</p>
<p>Blinken later told the BBC he was worried that Russia's Wagner mercenaries were using the instability in Niger to strengthen their presence in the Sahel.</p>
<p>ECOWAS has ordered <strong>sanctions</strong> on Niger and Western allies have suspended aid.</p>
<p><strong>Residents</strong> of Niamey who spoke to <em>Reuters</em> were strongly supportive of the overthrow.</p>

<p>Phonics is where written language meets spoken language.</p>
<p>Phonics teaches students the relationship between the letters of written language and the sounds of spoken language. The goal of phonics is to help students learn how to use the alphabet to read and write words. It also helps them understand writing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Letter-sound Connection (Phonics) " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-90dc-08db825b5fcb_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Letter-sound Connection (Phonics) </span></div>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for phonics</strong></p>
<p><u>Effective phonics instruction should:</u></p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>include letter shapes and names</li>
<li>work with each separate sound in a word</li>
<li>include all major letter-sound relationships</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Teach phonics in a clear and direct way with a plan. </u></p>
<p>When you teach letter-sound relationships tell your students the goal of the lesson. Explain the learning strategies you plan to use. After you teach something such as words or spelling patterns, plan to use them often with your students. Use them in sentences, songs, or poems. Play games with them. Read texts and stories using words or letters. Practice writing them.</p>
<p><u>Teach the ABCs.</u></p>
<p>Singing the ABC Song is a great place to start. As you say each letter, point to it. This will help teach the connection between letters and sounds. Have them write letters early and often.</p>
<p><u>However, do not teach the alphabet in order from A to Z. </u></p>
<p>It is fine to say or sing the full alphabet in order. However, when you begin teaching individual letters, experts advise against teaching them in order. Teachers often start with this group of letters — s, a, t, i, p, n. They make more three-letter words than any other six letters. Have them write letters early and often.</p>
<p><u>Teach commonly confused letters or sounds separately. </u></p>
<p>Some English language learners confuse some letters. If that is the case with your students, teach them separately. Let the students master one letter sound before moving to a similar one. Some commonly confused letters are:</p>
<p>- b, d, p</p>
<p>- e, i</p>
<p>- m, n</p>
<p>- t, d</p>
<p>If a sound is written more than one way, teach the different spellings one at a time. For example, the long /a/ sound can be spelled several different ways. Try teaching its forms in order:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>First, -ai as in "train;"</li>
<li>Next, -a_e as in "gate;"</li>
<li>Then, -ay as in "day;"</li>
<li>Finally, use them together in a game or activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Teach short vowel sounds first.</u> Words with short vowel sounds are usually easier to say and spell. At this stage, teach single-beat (<strong>syllable</strong>) words with short vowel sounds, like "sat" and "pat." However, short vowel sounds can be confusing. So, teach them separately.</p>
<p><u>Teach easy and common consonant letter sounds first.</u></p>
<p>Some consonants are easier than others. Usually, consonants that you can stretch out are easier to say – letters like m, s, and f.</p>
<p>With some consonant combinations you can hear each letter, such as fl, sp, tr, and st. (These are called <strong>blends</strong>. In the video for this article, you can hear them all.) Teach these with short vowel sounds, for example "flap," "spin," "trim," "step."</p>
<p>With some consonant combinations, the consonants become one sound, such as the /sh/ in "sheep." (These are called <strong>digraphs</strong>.) Teach common consonant combinations like ch, sh, and th. But keep in mind, some students may have a hard time with these.</p>
<p>For all of these suggestions, teachers must decide which sounds are easiest for their students.</p>
<p><strong>Learning strategies for teaching phonics</strong></p>
<p><u>Learning Strategy: Use all the senses.</u></p>
<p>Let the students see your face and mouth make the sounds. Use a mirror so the students can see their own mouths make sounds.</p>
<p>Have students touch their throats and say letter sounds. Some letters move the throat. Some letters do not move the throat.</p>
<p>Put a tissue in front of your face and show how some sounds make the tissue move while others do not.</p>
<p>Have students draw letters with their fingers while saying them. Students can draw letters in materials like sand or paint.</p>
<p>Students can also build letters with their bodies. Put students in groups. Give them a letter or they can pick a letter. Then they make the letter with their bodies.</p>
<p><u>Learning Strategy: Alphabet Matching</u></p>
<p>Young learners are just beginning to understand that there are relationships between written letters and spoken sounds. They are also learning that these relationships follow rules. They are learning the <strong>alphabetic principle</strong>.</p>
<p>Teachers can help students develop this understanding with fun activities that play with alphabet letters and sounds — for example, games that match lowercase and uppercase letters.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for phonics</strong></p>
<p>Ask students questions about lesson material. Some assessments will be spoken, and some will be written.</p>
<p>Sample questions:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>What sound do the letters "s" and "h" make when you put them together?</li>
<li>How do you spell the /sh/ sound?</li>
<li>How can I turn the word "bit" into "bite?"</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Ask students to pick out the following in a text:</u></p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>uppercase and lowercase letters</li>
<li>consonant sounds and letters</li>
<li>long vowel sounds and letters</li>
<li>short vowel sounds and letters</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Read short vowel sounds in consonant-vowel-consonant words:</u></p>
<p>mat, cat, bag, bat</p>
<p><u>Read consonant combinations with short vowels:</u></p>
<p>flag, trim, brag</p>
<p><u>Read long vowel spellings:</u></p>
<p>- long /a/ sound spelled ai, ay, a_e</p>
<p>- long /e/ sound spelled ee</p>
<p><u>Read words with many syllables:</u></p>
<p>- treehouse</p>
<p>- rainbow</p>
<p>- bookbag</p>
<p>- syllable</p>
<p>Use these tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve you and your learners. Change them to fit your students and teaching situation.</p>

<p>An ocean researcher at the University of California, San Diego says waves are getting bigger and stronger since 1970. There are also more "big wave events" than ever before.</p>
<p>A big wave is about four meters tall or more.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Large waves crash into a seawall in Pacifica, Calif., on Jan. 6, 2023. New data permits researchers to follow the growth of big waves over 90 years. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/b550885e-485d-47ac-9f42-2d7415c902ac_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Large waves crash into a seawall in Pacifica, Calif., on Jan. 6, 2023. New data permits researchers to follow the growth of big waves over 90 years. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)</span></div>
<p>Peter Bromirski at the university's Scripps Institution of Oceanography looked at <strong>seismic</strong> records going back to 1931 in his research.</p>
<p>Seismic information is often used to measure the power of earthquakes. But Bromirski said large waves create enough energy to be measured by seismographs, also.</p>
<p>When large waves reach the shore, they bounce back and run into new waves. The crash sends energy through the ocean floor where it can be measured by seismographs.</p>
<p>Those measurements permitted Bromirski to judge the strength and size of waves over a period of 90 years.</p>
<p>Bromirski said he "<strong>stumbled upon</strong>" the seismographic information. Before the discovery, he said, "it was almost impossible" to compare waves from the past with those from the present.</p>
<p>It took a lot of work to put the data together. Much of the information was on paper. Bromirski and his team of student researchers had to put the information into a computer so they could examine the data. The slow process took years.</p>
<p>They found that the height of most waves in the winter along the California coast have grown by about 30 centimeters since 1970. Starting that year, waves of over 4 meters happened more often, as well. Between 1996 and 2016, the large waves happened twice as often as they did from 1949 to 1969.</p>
<p>Bromirski and his team published their research recently in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.</em></p>
<p>1970 is the year scientists believe the warming of the planet began to speed up. Bromirski says the new data shows that climate change is making ocean waves taller and stronger. That means they are more likely to damage the coast, roads and structures, such as <strong>piers</strong> and houses.</p>
<p>Bromirski said his research may be a warning that bigger and stronger waves are ahead. With more warming, sea levels will rise and waves will get stronger, causing flooding and more damage to land. The California coast has already been damaged by big waves in recent years.</p>
<p>Gary Griggs is an ocean researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He did not work on the study. He said a 30 centimeter increase in wave height over 50 years is not that large. However, the findings of the study support what scientists already know: waves are becoming stronger and causing more damage along coasts.</p>
<p>He said Bromirski's project adds to the data showing the world is warming fast and sea levels are rising.</p>
<p>"The <strong>challenge</strong>," he said, "is sort of how to really <strong>respond </strong>to that."</p>

<p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is beginning a group of studies aimed at treatments for the condition called long COVID.</p>
<p>Reports say millions of Americans are affected by long-lasting effects from COVID-19 infections.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This undated, colorized electron microscope image made available by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. (NIAID-RML via AP, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-1675-08db9516dbd1_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This undated, colorized electron microscope image made available by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. (NIAID-RML via AP, File)</span></div>
<p>The NIH is using $1.15 billion provided through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to study how people recover from COVID-19. The project is called RECOVER. The goal is to pay for studies examining the health problems that COVID patients suffer long after their infection has ended.</p>
<p>Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly is with Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He is not involved in the NIH project. But his own research on American veterans has brought attention to long COVID. Speaking about the NIH's project, he said: "This is a year or two late and smaller in <strong>scope</strong> than one would hope but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction."</p>
<p>Al-Aly said getting answers is important because there are so many people pushing unproven <strong>therapies</strong>.</p>
<p>The term "long COVID" is used to describe about 200 symptoms. It is estimated that between 10 and 30 percent of people experience some form of long COVID after an infection.</p>
<p>However, even federal health officials cannot agree on what long COVID truly means. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has said, "If I get 10 people, I get 10 answers of what long COVID really is."</p>
<p>The RECOVER effort has followed 24,000 patients in what are called observational studies. The goal is to define the most common symptoms. The findings will help shape future tests for treatments of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Current tests are already taking place. They include a trial of Pfizer's antiviral drug Paxlovid. Researchers want to find out if Paxlovid can ease long COVID symptoms. The idea behind the study is that some coronaviruses remain in some patients and the treatment will help them.</p>
<p>Researchers are also studying treatments for "<strong>brain fog</strong>" and other thinking problems. Posit Science Corp. has a treatment program called BrianHQ. PASC-Cognitive Recovery is from New York City's Mount Sinai Health System. And Soterix Medical has a device that <strong>stimulates</strong> brain connections.</p>
<p>The two additional studies will begin in the coming months. One will test treatments for sleep problems in people with long COVID. Another will target breathing and heartbeat problems. People's bodies perform breathing and heartbeat unconsciously. The problems include the disorder POTS, which results from unusual blood flow to the heart.</p>
<p>One planned trial that is the subject of some disagreement involves intolerance to exercise and tiredness, or fatigue. It is not a normal experiment. It is known as a "platform study." This lets the NIH add new therapies at any time.</p>
<p>"We can rapidly <strong>pivot</strong>," said Dr. Amy Patterson, who is with the NIH. She said a failing treatment can be dropped without ending the trial. She added that the study can quickly include a treatment "if something promising comes on the <strong>horizon</strong>."</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Komaroff said it is important to be flexible. He is a researcher from Harvard University. He is not involved in NIH's RECOVER program. But he said studying the effects of Paxlovid on long COVID patients "makes all sorts of sense." But he said researchers should consider extending the treatment for longer than 25 days if there is little sign of improvement.</p>
<p>Komaroff said he understands that people get upset over the long wait for treatment trials. He believes, however, that NIH has waited the right amount of time. Waiting, he said, permits enough time for problems to be identified.</p>
<p>"You've got to have targets," Komaroff said.</p>

<p>If you walk into a clothing store, you are likely to be hit with an explosion of the color pink.</p>
<p>The pink wave has been fueled by the release last month of the wildly successful film<em> Barbie</em>. The movie is based on the popular doll of the same name, made by the toy company Mattel.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Ryan Gosling, left, and Margot Robbie in a scene from Barbie.

<p>Barbie dolls are known for their bright pink color. And clothes based on what the toy wears have become hugely popular. People are calling them Barbiecore <strong>outfits</strong>.</p>
<p>Barbie clothing items include shoes, backpacks, swimsuits and even special clothes for dogs.</p>
<p>"There is not a corner of the <strong>globe</strong> that hasn't turned pink," said Richard Dickson, Mattel's president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>The pink wave actually began last year, but Barbie strengthened it. High-end designer Valentino kicked off the pink wave by dressing models in head-to-toe in a pink color called fuchsia for a runway show in March of 2022.</p>
<p>A few months later, photos showed <em>Barbie</em> movie star Margot Robbie on set in a hot pink Western outfit. The look got a lot of attention online, said Madeline Hirsh. She is news director for the fashion magazine InStyle.</p>
<p>Around the same time, more and more people were returning to their workplaces and doing more social things as COVID-19 restrictions eased.</p>
<p>Hirsch said, "People were <strong>craving</strong> joy, color and new clothes to wear out again..."</p>
<p>The style took off. Fashion magazines published pictures of famous stars, including Kim Kardashian and Harry Styles, in bright Barbie-<strong>inspired</strong> clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Barbie stylized items</strong></p>
<p>Barbie is one of Mattel's top three <strong>brands</strong>. The toymaker <strong>trademarked</strong> the word Barbiecore in 2022. It also partnered with companies such as high-end French designer Balmain, Kendra Scott, and Barefoot Dreams.</p>
<p>Those efforts went into full force in 2023, with more than 100 partnerships tied to the movie. Mattel has also worked on many products outside of fashion, such as an Instagram-perfect pool float from Funboy and a pink Microsoft X-box gaming device in a Barbie Dreamhouse.</p>
<p>There are even Barbie-centric foods. They include an ice cream flavor and a Barbie Burger with pink sauce sold at Burger King fast food restaurants in Brazil.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>China has released an early form of new rules that aim to reduce the amount of time children spend on their smartphones.<br/>
中国发布了一项旨在减少儿童使用智能手机时间的规定草案。</p>
<p>The move affects companies such as Tencent and ByteDance, which run social media platforms and online games.<br/>
此举影响到腾讯和字节跳动等运营社交媒体平台和网络游戏的公司。</p>
<p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) published an early version of the rules on its website recently. The rules say that young people would not be permitted to use most internet services on mobile devices from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The rules also say that children between the ages of 16 and 18 would only be able to use the internet for two hours a day.<br/>
中国网信办最近在其网站上发布了该规定的草案。规定称，青少年在晚上10点到早上6点之间将不被允许在移动设备上使用大多数互联网服务。规定还称，16岁到18岁的青少年每天只能上网两个小时。</p>
<p>Children between the ages of 8 and 15 would be permitted only an hour a day while those under 8 could spend only 40 minutes.<br/>
8岁至15岁的儿童每天只能上网一小时，而8岁以下的儿童只能上网40分钟。</p>
<p>Some services, such as apps or websites that are good for the physical and mental development of young people, will not be subject to the rules.<br/>
一些有利于年轻人身心发展的应用程序或网站将不受规定约束。</p>
<p>The proposed restrictions are Beijing's latest efforts to attempt to limit internet addiction, a problem it views as widespread among its youth.<br/>
这项规定草案是中国政府试图限制网络成瘾的最新举措，政府认为这个问题在青少年中普遍存在。</p>
<p>In 2019, the Chinese government limited children's daily online game time to 90 minutes a day. Officials then tightened those restrictions in 2021. Children could only spend an hour a day playing online games on Fridays, weekends and public holidays.<br/>
2019年，中国政府将儿童每天的网络游戏时间限制在90分钟以内。官员们随后在2021年收紧了这些规定。孩子们只能在周五、周末和公共假日每天玩一个小时的网络游戏。</p>
<p>Short-video and online video websites like Douyin, Bilibili and Kuaishou have offered youth modes that restrict the type of content shown to young people and the length of time they can use the service. Officials are also pushing for children to see more educational material, such as science experiments.<br/>
抖音、哔哩哔哩和快手等短视频和在线视频网站提供了青少年模式，该模式限制了向年轻人展示的内容类型和他们使用该服务的时长。有关官员也在推动孩子们看更多的教育材料，比如科学实验。</p>

<p>A new artificial intelligence (AI) method has been used to identify an <strong>asteroid</strong> that could one day present a threat to Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists made the discovery using a computer processing method called an algorithm. The algorithm searches through data collected by four different Earth-based telescopes. The goal is to identify asteroids that might present a risk of crashing into Earth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image shows the orbit of 2022 SF289 (green) at its closest approach to Earth (orbit in blue).

<p>The asteroid search effort is financed by the American space agency NASA. It is operated by a team at the University of Hawaii's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/">Institute for Astronomy</a>.</p>
<p>The system is called ATLAS. It involves four different telescopes. Two of the telescopes are based in Hawaii. Another operates in Chile and the other sits in South Africa. ATLAS is designed to search the whole sky several times each night looking for moving objects, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://atlas.fallingstar.com/">explains</a>.</p>
<p>NASA and its international partners continuously search the skies for what scientists call <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/did-you-know">near-Earth objects</a> (NEOs). Such objects include asteroids and <strong>comets</strong> that come within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit. The effort aims to identify and follow NEOs that could one day strike Earth.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/did-you-know">says</a> a large majority of the NEOs that enter Earth's atmosphere burn up before reaching the planet's surface. But the space agency is concerned about larger NEOs up to 50 meters in size. NASA says such objects could cause widespread damage to areas they hit.</p>
<p>The space agency considers NEOs that come within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth's orbit and that are bigger than 140 meters "potentially <strong>hazardous</strong> objects."</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Washington created the algorithm and led the latest discovery operation. The team <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/07/31/heliolinc3d/">announced</a> in a statement it had identified a 182-meter-long asteroid named 2022 SF289. The find came during testing of the new algorithm, which the researchers called HelioLinc3D.</p>
<p>The researchers said the newly discovered asteroid met the description of a <strong>potentially</strong> hazardous asteroid (PHA). However, the scientists said asteroid 2022 SF289 will likely present no threat to Earth in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The newly discovered asteroid was the first PHA to be identified with the HelioLinc3D algorithm. Scientists plan to use the new algorithm together with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is still being developed on top of a mountain in Chile.</p>
<p>Rubin is expected to start operating in early 2025. University of Washington researchers have said the observatory should greatly improve the discovery rate of PHAs. This is because the telescope was built with a very powerful new camera and a huge mirror.</p>
<p>Some NEOs are difficult to identify with existing telescopes because they can be blocked by bright areas of space. For example, other equipment missed asteroid 2022 SF289 because of rich star fields that exist in our Milky Way galaxy. Rubin's instruments are expected to provide more detailed images and data to improve the identification process for NEOs.</p>
<p>Ari Heinze is a researcher at the University of Washington and a main developer of the HelioLinc3D algorithm. He said in a statement, "By demonstrating the real-world effectiveness of the software that Rubin will use to look for thousands of yet-unknown potentially hazardous asteroids, the discovery of 2022 SF289 makes us all safer."</p>
<p>The University of Washington researchers say more than 2,350 have so far been discovered. They say with the new algorithm, scientists hope to identify thousands more. Astronomers using ATLAS say discoveries of PHAs are made when they identify "a point of light moving <strong>unambiguously</strong> in a straight line over the image series."</p>
<p>The HelioLinc3D algorithm was developed specifically to be used by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. But Heinze and other researchers said they wanted to see if it could discover a new asteroid using existing telescope data.</p>
<p>After Rubin's team set HelioLinc3D to search through Rubin data, it identified its first PHA on July 18. The asteroid was 20 million kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p>ATLAS astronomer Larry Denneau was a leader of the discovery team. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/07/31/heliolinc3d/">said</a> the algorithm shows "it is possible to recover these <strong>faint</strong> objects as long as they are visible over several nights." Denneau added, "This in effect gives us a bigger, better telescope."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Japanese railway operator, Seibu, is testing a special help desk for foreigners at one of the company's busiest train stations.<br/>
日本铁路运营商西武正在该公司其中一个最繁忙的火车站测试一种面向外国人的特殊服务台。</p>
<p>Visitors who need help at the Seibu-Shinjuku station in Tokyo can go to an information window and ask questions. About 135,000 people per day pass through the Seibu-Shinjuku station.<br/>
在东京西武新宿站需要帮助的游客可以到一个信息窗口提问。每天约有13.5万人通过西武新宿站。</p>
<p>To get help, a person just speaks into a microphone. A system called VoiceBiz listens to their words and displays them on the window in Japanese. The railway worker can see the question and reply in Japanese. Then VoiceBiz translates the answer into a language the person who needs help can understand. The system works with Japanese and 11 other languages.<br/>
有人要寻求帮助，只用对着麦克风说话。VoiceBiz系统会听他们说话，并用日语显示在窗口上。铁路员工可以看到问题，并用日文回答。然后VoiceBiz将答复翻译成需要帮助的人士所能理解的语言。该系统可适用于日语和其他11种语言。</p>
<p>Rail stations throughout Japan are very busy this summer. More than 2 million people visited Japan in June, the most since before 2020. COVID-19 restrictions barred most foreign travelers for a long time.<br/>
日本各地的火车站今年夏天都很繁忙。6月份访问日本的人数超过200万，为2020年前以来最多。新冠肺炎限制措施长期禁止大多数外国游客入境。</p>
<p>Kevin Khani was visiting Japan from Germany. He tried out the VoiceBiz system recently after getting confused in Seibu's Shinjuku station.<br/>
凯文·卡尼从德国到访日本。最近，他在西武新宿车站搞晕头后，试用了VoiceBiz系统。</p>
<p>He said the translations were "spot on," which means they were exactly right. He also said it is nice to see that there is a human working at the window.<br/>
他说这些翻译“准确无误”，这意味着它们完全正确。他还说，很高兴看到有人在窗口工作。</p>
<p>"So, you take your time to explain what you need, and you will know that they will understand what you need," he said.<br/>
他说：“所以，你慢慢来说出你需要什么，你就会知道，他们会搞懂你需要什么。”</p>
<p>The Seibu railway has been testing the VoiceBiz system for three months. After that time, the company will consider using it in additional stations.<br/>
西武铁路已经测试VoiceBiz系统三个月了。之后，该公司将考虑在其他车站使用该系统。</p>
<p>Ayano Yajima is a sales and marketing official for Seibu. Yajima said looking at each other adds to the "smoothness of communication."<br/>
八州绫野是西武的销售和营销官员。八州绫野说，看着彼此会增加“沟通的顺畅性”。</p>
<p>Toppan is the company that makes VoiceBiz. It tested the window at Kansai International Airport near Osaka earlier this year. It hopes to sell the windows to businesses and government offices in Japan so they can communicate with travelers and immigrants.<br/>
凸版公司制造了VoiceBiz系统。今年早些时候，该公司在大阪附近的关西国际机场测试了这个窗口。它希望将这些窗口出售给日本的企业和政府办公室，以便他们能够与游客和移民交流。</p>
<p>The company believes the Shinjuku area is a good testing place. The busiest railway station in the world is nearby – 3.6 million people use the Japan Railway station in Shinjuku. Many people use the Seibu train to get to other trains and subways and go to other places in Tokyo or the rest of Japan. As a result, there is a high chance that someone gets lost or needs help.<br/>
该公司认为新宿地区是一个很好的测试场所。世界上最繁忙的火车站就在附近——360万人使用新宿的日本火车站。许多人乘坐西武列车，搭乘其他火车和地铁，前往东京或日本其他地方。因此，很有可能有人会迷路或需要帮助。</p>
<p>French visitors Isabelle and Marc Rigaud used the help window to find their way from the Seibu station to the Japan Railway station. They had just gotten off an airplane at 1 in the morning, local time.<br/>
法国游客伊莎贝尔和马克·里戈使用该求助窗口找到了从西武站到日本火车站的路线。他们于当地时间凌晨1点刚下飞机。</p>
<p>"It's very Japan," Isabelle said of the technology.<br/>
伊莎贝尔在谈到这项技术时说：“这很日本。”</p>

            <title>More Companies Seek to Recycle Solar Panels  (2023/8/7)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">06 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Many plans designed to deal with climate change depend on the use of clean energy from the sun, or solar power. But the equipment necessary for solar power sometimes gets damaged or wears out. These solar <strong>panels</strong> often end up as waste in <strong>landfills</strong>.</p>
<p>A business based in Yuma, Arizona, is trying to deal with what its founders call a tsunami of solar waste. The company is called We <strong>Recycle</strong> Solar.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Dwight Clark inspects a used solar panel at We Recycle Solar on Tuesday, June 6, 2023, in Yuma, Ariz. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c30b2cc8-d090-47e6-a863-be9e1f4174ef_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Dwight Clark inspects a used solar panel at We Recycle Solar on Tuesday, June 6, 2023, in Yuma, Ariz. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)</span></div>
<p><strong>Large amounts of waste </strong></p>
<p>Workers move large numbers of solar panels with special machines, then lift each out by hand to begin separating by maker and model. Some panels only have a few cracks in their glass.</p>
<p>These panels can be reused, said company chief Adam Saghei.</p>
<p>The panels that do not go to testing and resale instead go to a special area where glass, metals, and other materials with value are separated.</p>
<p>Solar panels are built to survive many years of bad weather, so it is difficult to take them apart.</p>
<p>Separating the glass without it breaking, for example, is difficult. But We Recycle Solar uses special robotic devices that can do the work successfully.</p>
<p>Some of the highest value materials in solar panels are copper, silver, aluminum, glass, and crystalline silicon.</p>
<p>For Saghei, the idea for the company came in 2017. He was working in the computer electronic waste sector. He saw solar panels spread across roofs and wondered where the panels would go in the future. He said he realized that green technology does not stay green once it is no longer being used.</p>
<p>Copper is one metal the recycling process produces, said Dwight Clark, director of recycling technology at We Recycle Solar. Clark said there is not a lot of copper in each solar panel. But when the company recycles around 4500 kilograms of solar panels in an hour, the company can get over a hundred kilograms of copper.</p>
<p><strong>The future </strong></p>
<p>By 2050, solar panel waste will total some 78 million tons worldwide, said Mool Gupta of the University of Virginia. The reason recycling and recovery is not very strong yet, Gupta said, is that companies do not want to pay the $30 per panel cost when it costs only $1 to send it to a landfill.</p>
<p>Garvin Heath is a renewable energy expert at the U.S. Department of Energy. He said the cost to recycle should not be more than the cost to put solar panels in landfills. He said consumers should not have to pay anything and recycling businesses should not suffer financial losses.</p>
<p>Other companies are starting to get into the business.</p>
<p>Solarcycle, a new company based in Odessa, Texas, raised $30 million earlier this year. And Solarpanelrecycling.com is connected to electronics recycler PowerHouse Recycling.</p>
<p>The European Union has rules that require recycling of electronic waste under its Waste Electrical and Electronic Waste Directive (WEEE).</p>
<p>Market researcher Visiongain estimates the global market for solar panel recycling at $138 million for last year and growing fast.</p>
<p>Jack Groppo of the University of Kentucky says people have to stop sending solar panels to the landfill as soon as possible. "Once the solar panels go into the landfill, they're gone unless we go back and mine the landfill," he said.</p>
<p>Groppo estimates that in 20 years people will mine landfills to get valuable materials in the solar panels. But he said it makes more sense to separate the panels at their retirement instead.</p>
<p>The Yuma facility can process 7,500 panels in a single day. As of early June, it estimates more than 650,000 tons of carbon dioxide waste production have been avoided. It is reusing about 60 percent of the panels that come in.</p>
<p>The company plans to open another recycling center next to a large solar manufacturer in the southeastern part of the country.</p>
<p>For now, solar recycling companies are still looking for a way to make money. But Gupta said these profitability issues are temporary. Researchers are hard at work on solving them, he said.</p>
<p>He added, "Too many lives are lost to pollution and solar is one of the top solutions."</p>

<p>A nonprofit group in Geneva, Switzerland is making <strong>refrigerators</strong> available so restaurant owners and cooks can make food available to the public before it goes bad.</p>
<p>The refrigerators are being placed along streets for anyone to use. The project is part of a continuing effort by people in Switzerland and other European countries to cut down on food waste.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Free Food Fridge Albany sidewalk refrigerator is stocked with produce and other food, June 25, 2021, in Albany, N.Y.

<p>The nonprofit Free-Go has put refrigerators and food storage centers in Geneva so people can get fruit, vegetables, breads and other foods at no cost. Free-Go is a smart play on the word "frigo," which is an informal French word for refrigerator.</p>
<p>The program costs about $40,000 to run each year. It receives support from private groups and the city government. Free-Go launched a year ago with a single refrigerator outside a community center in western Geneva. There are now four refrigerators around the city. The group plans a fifth before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Marine Delevaux is the project's director. She said the food left in its refrigerators is usually taken within an hour of being left. For health and legal reasons, no frozen foods, open food containers, prepared meals, or alcohol are permitted in the refrigerators.</p>
<p>Free-Go also lets people who use the service plan when they will get their food. The idea is to make it easier for people who live in <strong>apartment buildings</strong> to join the program. There is also a telephone line, or "hotline," that restaurants can use to call for someone to <strong>pick up</strong> unused food.</p>
<p>"Generally, when the food collected from <strong>shops</strong> and restaurants arrives in the morning, people are already waiting to help themselves," Delevaux said.</p>
<p>She added that the first Geneva refrigerator helped save 3.2 tons of food from going to waste last year. Of the food donated, only about three percent had to be thrown away because nobody wanted it.</p>
<p>Free-Go said those who give food from private businesses, like restaurants or food sellers, must promise to make sure the donated food is safe to eat. Swiss law says food past the "recommended use-by" date can be eaten for up to a year afterwards, Delevaux said.</p>
<p>The Swiss government estimates that nearly one-third of all food products are wasted or thrown away. That amounts to about 330 kilograms of food waste per person each year. Of that, about 100 kilograms are waste from households.</p>
<p>Free-Go says about 1 billion tons of food go to waste every year around the world. The group says the waste uses up energy and other resources in the farming and transportation process.</p>
<p>"Wasting food is not only an ethical and economic issue but it also <strong>depletes</strong> the environment of limited natural resources," the European Union's Commission said.</p>
<p>Similar food-sharing campaigns are in place in the Swiss capital, Bern, and in the town of Neuchatel. The idea was first imported from Germany.</p>
<p>Foodsharing.de is a community group in Germany that started more than 10 years ago. It said that more than half a million people in Germany, Switzerland and Austria have made "the food-sharing <strong>initiative</strong> an international movement." The group said it has helped save 83 million tons of food from going to waste.</p>
<p>Because the food is free, and the donations can change, it is not always clear what will appear in the refrigerators. Some people receiving food might not get what they want or need.</p>
<p>Outside a community center in Geneva recently, Shala Moradi said she was looking for some bread and there was none. She is 65 years old and came from Iran. She has lived in Geneva for 10 years. She said she <strong>appreciates</strong> the initiative.</p>
<p>"It's very good. I can take strawberries, cherries, things like that," she said, talking about the different food that is available. Of the no cost food, she said, "I like that too."</p>
<p>Severine Cuendet is a 54-year-old teacher. Just after leaving some vegetables that she grew, she said, "We have too much" and praised the initiative "because this neighborhood has a lot of need."</p>
<p>She added, "And it happens to all of us to buy too much."</p>

<p>New rules aim to protect horseshoe crabs, which are used in medical research, and also to support an endangered bird <strong>species</strong>.</p>
<p>Blue blood from horseshoe crabs is used by researchers to test for dangerous substances in vaccines, medicines and medical devices. The animals are also used by fisherman as <strong>bait</strong> to catch eels and sea snails.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Horseshoe crabs spawn at Reeds Beach in Cape May Court House, N.J., Tuesday, June 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-8df0-08db920c47ff_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Horseshoe crabs spawn at Reeds Beach in Cape May Court House, N.J., Tuesday, June 13, 2023.

<p>In addition, the eggs of horseshoe crabs are an important food for an endangered bird called the red knot.</p>
<p>Scientists say horseshoe crabs have been living in ocean environments for more than 400 million years. But they are different from other crabs. They are more closely related to spiders and scorpions. The animals have been decreasing in numbers in areas they live in, called habitats, along the U.S. East Coast.</p>
<p>The blue blood is taken from the animals for medical research. The process returns the crabs to the environment. But many die from the blood harvesting process.</p>
<p>Blood from the crabs can be manufactured into limulus amebocyte lysate, or LAL, a substance used to identify dangerous substances in some medications and vaccines.</p>
<p>Fishermen collect the crabs by hand or with special equipment on boats for use by biomedical companies. The blood – which contains immune cells sensitive to bacteria – is then separated and proteins are processed. It takes many crabs to produce enough blood to fill a single glass tube, which contains cells that are sensitive to bacteria.</p>
<p>New guidelines for dealing with horseshoe crabs were approved in May by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Industry officials said those changes should keep more crabs alive. But, in recent years, environmentalists brought attention to the issue of the horseshoe crabs, including their relationship to the red knot.</p>
<p>Red knots are birds that travel about 30,500 kilometers back and forth from South America to Canada. During their long trip, the birds must stop to eat along the way and horseshoe crabs are an important food.</p>
<p>Bethany Kraft is a coastal <strong>conservation</strong> specialist with the environmental organization the Audubon Society. Kraft told The Associated Press (AP) that red knots need horseshoe crab eggs to give them enough fuel to complete their long flights. "There's very clear linkage between horseshoe crabs and the survival of the red knot in the coming <strong>decades</strong>," she added.</p>
<p>Kraft said horseshoe crabs currently need stronger protection to survive. She and other wildlife conservationists have noted the new guidelines are currently only voluntary. This, they say, still leaves the red knot at risk. They say the bird needs stronger legal protection.</p>
<p>The new guidelines urge best practices for the biomedical industry's harvesting and processing of the crabs. They include measures aimed at limiting <strong>exposure</strong> to sunlight and keeping crabs cool and wet.</p>
<p>Caitlin Starks is a fishery specialist with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. She told the AP the goal of the guidelines "is to give the crabs that are bled a better chance of surviving."</p>
<p>That is exactly what the new guidelines will do, said Nora Blair, an operations official with Charles River Laboratories. The company manufactures LAL from horseshoe crab blood. Blair was a member of a working group that created the new guidelines along with other industry groups.</p>
<p>Blair said the industry is working to find <strong>synthetic</strong> materials that could be used for biomedical research. Conservationists have been pushing for years for such a solution. Lonza, a Switzerland-based company that manufactures LAL, offers an animal-free testing solution.</p>
<p>But Blair said that, for now, the wild harvest of horseshoe crabs remains extremely important for drug safety. The animals play an important part in supplying and testing drugs and the coastal environment makes their conservation "<strong>imperative</strong>," she added.</p>

            <title>US Colleges Ask for More Writing after Affirmative Action Ban  (2023/8/6)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">05 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>August 1 is the start of the new college <strong>admissions</strong> season in the United States. It is the day students can start to complete the Common Application for college admission in 2024.</p>
<p>The Common Application is accepted by over 1,000 colleges and universities. The service permits students to <strong>apply</strong> to many schools by submitting their information only one time.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A sign points the way to the Harvard College Admissions Visitors Center at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., July 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/13cb9c21-c17c-4e4c-ac4b-e322b40519e0_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A sign points the way to the Harvard College Admissions Visitors Center at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., July 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)</span></div>
<p>However, some colleges and universities that accept the Common Application are asking students to send in an extra piece of writing. They are using the extra "<strong>prompt</strong>" to give students a chance to discuss their background.</p>
<p>The reason for this new writing prompt is the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to end affirmative action in college decisions.</p>
<p>The court said <strong>selective</strong> colleges and universities, such as Harvard University or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, can no longer use race as a way to decide between two qualified students.</p>
<p>But the court did say schools can consider "an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life..."</p>
<p>That is why some schools are re-writing their prompts.</p>
<p>At Yale University, students who apply with the Common Application must also answer one of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://admissions.yale.edu/essay-topics" target="_blank">three questions</a>.</p>
<p>The first question permits students to write about a time they discussed an important issue with someone holding an opposing view.</p>
<p>Another question asks students to discuss a meaningful community to which they are connected.</p>
<p>But a third question is new, compared to past years. It asks students to talk about part of their "personal experience that you feel will <strong>enrich</strong> your college."</p>
<p>That question permits a student to state their race and discuss how they would add something special to the group of students at Yale.</p>
<p>At Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, a new prompt asks students to "tell about a community that you have been part of where your <strong>participation</strong> helped to change or shape the community for the better."</p>
<p>Timothy Fields is a top admissions official at Emory. He said the new questions "are going to be much more targeted."</p>
<p>At Sarah Lawrence College outside of New York City, a new question asks students how the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action might affect their lives.</p>
<p>Kevin McKenna is a vice president at the college. He said the new question gives students a chance to discuss the decision "that could <strong>impact</strong> the student bodies of the colleges to which they are applying."</p>
<p><strong>An acceptance campaign</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the new questions, many colleges and universities are thinking about how to connect with Black and Latino students. The school leaders worry that those students may think they are no longer welcome at selective universities after the Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>Amin Abdul-Malik Gonzalez is the top admissions official at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He and his team are planning extra time at high schools and more meetings at college information events to tell minority students they are still welcome.</p>
<p>He also will offer more training to his admissions officers so they can work to build a <strong>diverse</strong> group of students without going against the Supreme Court's decision.</p>
<p>Visits such as those by the Wesleyan team are important, said Angel Perez. He is head of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Perez said some college counselors for high school students are uncertain how their students should address their race in applications.</p>
<p>"The general feeling with school counselors right now is mostly <strong>anxiety</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>But those who work with students, like private admissions counselor Shereem Herndon-Brown, say students should not overstate how race affects their lives.</p>
<p>Herndon-Brown wrote a book with Fields, the admissions leader at Emory. He said students need to write "<strong>authentically</strong>" about how they think and have developed as a result of their background.</p>
<p>He gave an example of a Black student from New York who recently visited relatives in the southern part of the U.S. Herndon-Brown encouraged the student to write about that experience although it was not in the student's original plan.</p>
<p>That he said, is a better idea than declaring their race or overstating their disadvantage.</p>
<p>"There is no way to trick an admissions officer or a school into believing you're something that you're not," he says.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Great ideas can be the <strong>lifeblood </strong>of any project. That means they can bring a project to life or even back from the dead. From redesigning a home to creating an educational product, <strong>bold</strong>, creative ideas are valuable.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Flags of member nations at NATO headquarters." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-e62f-08db343e7c1a_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Flags of member nations at NATO headquarters.</span></div>
<p>But often even a great idea needs a little work. It may need <strong>tweaking</strong>,<strong> </strong>meaning you need to make<strong> </strong>small changes. So, before sharing an idea with a large group, we may want to share it with a smaller group. We can test it out first, before putting the idea into action.</p>
<p>But first, let's talk about getting that big idea.</p>
<p>You may have heard of brainstorming. This is an idea-creating activity. When we brainstorm, we say ideas as quickly as we think of them.</p>
<p>In informal situations, we can call this <u>throwing spaghetti at the wall</u>. Why, you may ask? Well, cooked spaghetti is sticky. If spaghetti is cooked enough, it will stick when you throw it against the wall. If it is not cooked enough, it might not stick.</p>
<p>Good ideas stick too. In brainstorming, we often say we throw ideas around. And the good ones stay or stick. But as we said earlier, even if an idea sticks, we may want to test it out before sharing it with a large group of people.</p>
<p>That is when we can <u>run it up the flagpole</u>. Running an idea, plan, or proposal up the flagpole is a way to test interest or get <strong>feedback</strong>. The full phrase is "run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes." Military members <strong>salute</strong> when our flag is present and when they hear the first note of the national anthem.</p>
<p>Let's listen to an example: If you are the leader of a project, you could say to your team, "I like that plan. But it is risky. Let's run it up the flagpole before <strong>pitching</strong> it to the boss." In other words, you want to get more opinions before making the plan official.</p>
<p>Here is another example: When writing these stories, I often run my ideas up a flagpole. I respect the opinions of my co-workers and often take their suggestions <u>on board</u> – meaning I take them into consideration. So, I like bouncing ideas off them.</p>
<p>And that is a more common way to express this idea. <u>Bouncing something off someone</u> is a way to know their thoughts. You are asking their opinion and are looking to see their reaction. Bouncing ideas around is a good way to <strong><u>gauge</u></strong><u> interest</u> – to find out what people think.</p>
<p>So, the next time you have an idea, and you are unsure about it, run it up the flagpole! Bounce it off some friends! With the right people, you will soon know if it is good, bad, or needs work.</p>
<p>And that is all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time...</p>

<span class="byline">By Kelly Jean Kelly</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">05 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Benjamin Harrison.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Benjamin Harrison" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fbc85745-b2a6-494e-be5a-05b8b04f862a_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Benjamin Harrison</span></div>
<p>His family name may sound familiar. That is because he was the grandson of President <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-william-henry-harrison/3806092.html" target="_blank">William Henry Harrison</a>. That situation is unique in U.S. history so far.</p>
<p>Harrison played an unusually active <strong>role</strong> as president at a time when most chief executives saw themselves as simply administrators. As a result, American writer and intellectual Henry Adams said Harrison was the best president since Lincoln.</p>
<p>But most Americans remember little about him, except his connection to the previous President Harrison, who himself died after only a month in office.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Benjamin Harrison grew up on a farm in the Midwestern state of Ohio as one of eight children.</p>
<p>His grandfather was not the only famous political Harrison.</p>
<p>His great-grandfather signed the Declaration of Independence. And his father had been a congressman.</p>
<p>Young Benjamin Harrison respected these men and believed he had a role to play in history, too. He received a good education, and even outside of school he read many books.</p>
<p>His hard work and intelligence carried him to Miami University in Ohio, and then to a career as a lawyer.</p>
<p>Along the way, he married a woman he had known since he was a teenager, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/carolineharrison" target="_blank">Caroline Lavinia Scott</a>. The couple settled in another Midwestern city, Indianapolis, Indiana, and had a son and daughter.</p>
<p>Over time, Harrison steadily built a career as a public official. But his political path was <strong>interrupted</strong> by the American Civil War.</p>
<p>Harrison rose to the rank of general in the Union Army. He fought under General William T. Sherman, and was one of the first soldiers to enter Atlanta, Georgia after the city surrendered.</p>
<p>After the war, he returned home to Indiana and continued his legal and political career. In 1881, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. But six years later he lost his seat when Democrats came to power in his state.Reports say that Harrison was an excellent soldier. But he did not enjoy fighting or find war <strong>romantic</strong>.</p>
<p>Harrison's loss of his Senate seat soon turned to a victory. The Republican Party nominated him as their candidate to run against Grover Cleveland in the 1888 presidential election.</p>
<p>Cleveland's economic policies had become unpopular, and Republicans worked hard to support their candidate. They succeeded. Although Cleveland won the popular vote, Harrison won the Electoral College.</p>
<p>In 1889, he followed his grandfather's footsteps all the way to the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency </strong></p>
<p>Harrison's election was a major victory for his Republican Party. In addition to winning the White House, Republicans gained seats in the House of Representatives, held a majority in the Senate, and appointed several Republican justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Harrison and other Republican lawmakers used their power to take action on issues at home and internationally.</p>
<p>One act was to preserve forests. Harrison identified 17 protected natural areas, and helped create Yosemite National Park in California.</p>
<p>His government also established Ellis Island in New York to make immigration to the U.S. a more orderly process.</p>
<p>Internationally, Harrison's administration sought to build ties with Latin American countries. His government established what would, in time, become the Organization of American States.</p>
<p>His administration also increased the United States' global trade – as well as the country's navy.</p>
<p>But, for the most part, the most pressing issues of the day were economic. The federal government at that time had an unusually large surplus. Some argued that the surplus was hurting business. In answer, Harrison's government placed a high protective tariff on imported goods. The legislation was known as the McKinley Tariff of 1890.</p>
<p>Officials also aimed to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Sherman-Antitrust-Act">limit the power of large corporations</a> to control important markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>Finally, they agreed to require the government to buy silver to use as currency.</p>
<p>These actions pleased some of his supporters. But, they <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.historylink.org/File/2030">may have contributed</a> to the severe economic depression that followed Harrison's term.</p>
<p>And in general, voters disapproved of the amount of money Republican lawmakers were spending. Although the country was at peace, the 51<sup>st</sup> Congress <strong>appropriated</strong> $1 billion. At the midterm elections, many lawmakers paid for all the spending with their seats.</p>
<p>Two years later, voters turned Harrison out of the White House, too. They returned Grover Cleveland to the presidency.</p>
<p>Harrison did not express much disappointment. He had worked hard to become president like his grandfather. But he found he did not like being the chief executive. He said when he left the White House, it was like being released from prison.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Among U.S. presidents, Harrison does not have one of the most dramatic biographies. The facts of his life show an intelligent, disciplined man who tried to live by his beliefs.</p>
<p>But he was not considered <strong>passionate </strong>about many things, except perhaps his enjoyment of nature. And he did not have an easy way with people. Even his staff called him "the human iceberg" because he could be <strong>aloof</strong> and act coldly toward people.</p>
<p>Yet Harrison's family brought some warmth to his administration. His wife, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/carolineharrison">Caroline</a>, was known to be a lively, social person. She was the first to install a Christmas tree in the White House.</p>
<p>Some of Harrison's grandchildren also lived in the White House. Harrison permitted them to play on the grounds with their pet animals. During Harrison's term, the family kept a goat, which the children called "Old Whiskers."</p>
<p>Harrison's time in the White House saw sorrow, too. Toward the end of her husband's term, the first lady became seriously ill with tuberculosis. For months, Benjamin Harrison divided his attention between his wife and his job, and yet in the end lost both.</p>
<p>After his term as president ended, Benjamin Harrison returned to his home in Indianapolis. He did some work as a teacher and lawyer, and kept a good public image in his community.</p>
<p>He also re-married. His second wife was a widow herself, as well as his first wife's niece.</p>
<p>He and Mary Scott Lord Dimmick Harrison had a daughter together. The child was only four when Harrison died from pneumonia at age 67.</p>

            <title>Russia’s Bolshoi Ballet Aims to Perform again in the West  (2023/8/5) | 俄罗斯著名芭蕾舞团渴望重返西方舞台</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/russia-s-bolshoi-ballet-aims-to-perform-again-in-the-west.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The artistic director of Moscow's state-owned Bolshoi Ballet has promised the group will one day perform in the West again.<br/>
莫斯科国有的莫斯科大剧院芭蕾舞团的艺术总监承诺，该团终有一天会再次在西方演出。</p>
<p>The famous ballet company performed last week in China at Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts. It was the company's first performance outside of Russia since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. The company has faced boycotts from many countries because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.<br/>
这家著名的芭蕾舞团上周在北京国家大剧院演出。这是该舞团自2020年新冠肺炎疫情开始以来首次在国外表演。由于2022年2月俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，该舞团面临许多国家的抵制。</p>
<p>Artistic director Mahkar Vaziev said the Bolshoi was "not suffering" from being unable to perform in the West.<br/>
艺术总监马哈尔·瓦齐耶夫表示，莫斯科大剧院无法在西方演出“并不痛苦”。</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that one day everything will go back to how it should be because culture is a wave that is very hard to suppress," Vaziev said.<br/>
瓦齐耶夫说：“我毫不怀疑，总有一天一切都会回到它应有的状态，因为文化是一股很难压制的浪潮。”</p>
<p>For many people, the Bolshoi represents the highest level of Russian culture. The ballet company was founded in 1776 by Empress Catherine the Great. The company performed around the world even during the most difficult times of the Cold War.<br/>
对许多人来说，莫斯科大剧院代表了俄罗斯文化的最高水平。这支芭蕾舞团由女皇凯瑟琳大帝于1776年创立。即使在冷战最困难的时期，该舞团也在世界各地演出。</p>
<p>Bolshoi's dancers hope their performance in China is a sign that they will return to performing around the world.<br/>
莫斯科大剧院的舞者们希望他们在中国的表演是他们将重返世界各地表演的标志。</p>
<p>However, only two other performances are currently on the company's schedule. The dancers are set to perform in the Belarusian capital Minsk in November and Oman next January.<br/>
然而，目前该舞团日程上只有另外两场演出。舞者们将于11月在白俄罗斯首都明斯克表演，明年1月在阿曼表演。</p>
<p>The Bolshoi's time in Beijing includes two performances that will show parts of its best-known ballets. It will then give a three-day staging of the 19th-century ballet "Don Quixote".<br/>
莫斯科大剧院在北京的演出将包括两台演出，它将展示其最著名的芭蕾舞剧的部分内容。然后它将连续三天上演19世纪芭蕾舞剧《堂吉诃德》。</p>
<p>The Bolshoi still receives around 70 percent of its financial support from the Russian government, a company official said. No current performers have spoken out against the Russian invasion. The United Nations reports the war has injured or killed about 8,500 civilians.<br/>
莫斯科大剧院官员表示，其70%左右的财政支持仍来自俄罗斯政府。目前没有任何表演者公开反对俄罗斯的入侵。联合国报告称，这场战争已造成约8500名平民受伤或死亡。</p>
<p>In February 2022, the day after Moscow sent thousands of troops into Ukraine, London's Royal Opera House canceled Bolshoi performances planned for the summer of that year.<br/>
2022年2月，在莫斯科向乌克兰派遣数千名士兵的第二天，伦敦皇家歌剧院取消了原定于当年夏天举行的莫斯科大剧院演出。</p>
<p>Cancellations in other Western cities soon followed. Creative work with Western artists and theaters came to a stop.<br/>
其他西方城市也很快取消了预订。该舞团与西方艺术家和剧院的创造性工作陷入停滞。</p>
<p>Several Russian and foreign dancers also quit the company to show their strong disapproval of the Ukraine war. Former principal ballerina Olga Smirnova was among those who quit.<br/>
几名俄罗斯和外国舞者也退出了该舞团，以表达他们对乌克兰战争的强烈不满。前首席芭蕾舞演员奥尔加·斯米尔诺娃也在辞职之列。</p>
<p>Elizaveta Kokoreva joined the company at the beginning of the pandemic. She is now its principal ballerina. She said, "I would really like to visit other countries, see the world, and get to know different venues, theatres, teachers and choreographers."<br/>
伊丽莎维塔·科科雷娃在疫情开始时加入了该舞团。她现在是该舞团的首席芭蕾舞演员。她说：“我真的很想访问其他国家，看看世界，了解不同的场地、剧院、老师和编舞家。”</p>
<p>She added, "But it is what it is right now."<br/>
她补充道，“但现状就是这样。”</p>

<p>The move by automobile manufacturers to include radios in cars nearly 100 years ago helped spread AM radio across the United States.</p>
<p>But now, some carmakers want to stop providing AM radio in their new vehicles.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The number of AM radio stations in the United States is dwindling and could get smaller: Some automakers want to kick AM off their dashboard radios." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-6236-08db8fa412d7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The number of AM radio stations in the United States is dwindling and could get smaller: Some automakers want to kick AM off their dashboard radios.</span></div>
<p>The first cars to be sold with radios were introduced in the 1930s. They only received one kind of radio <strong>transmission</strong>, those that broadcast using AM, or amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>After some time, radios could receive transmissions in AM and FM. FM stands for frequency modulation.</p>
<p>For many years, those were the only choices. But after a while, car makers added <strong>8-track</strong> players, audio <strong>cassette</strong> players, <strong>compact disc</strong> players and eventually Bluetooth connections so people could play music from mobile devices such as an iPhone.</p>
<p>However, cars are no longer sold with 8-track players or compact disc players. And now, some new electric cars are being sold with radios that only receive FM signals. Car makers say the driving systems in electric vehicles interfere with the AM signal.</p>
<p>That concerns the people who own and work at about 4,000 radio stations in the U.S. that broadcast in AM. One of them is in the small town of Dimmitt, Texas. Nancy and Todd Whalen own the radio station KDHN-1470, which has been broadcasting since 1963. They are the only employees, and they talk on the radio every morning. The Whalens have run the station for eight years.</p>
<p>They say they do it, so Dimmitt has something to feel good about. "We feel like what we've done and continue to do is provide that, not just for Dimmitt, but for all the small towns in the area that no longer have local radio stations."</p>
<p>KDHN also runs a translator, or a system that changes the signal so their programs can also be heard on FM. But the AM signal is much stronger. The FM signal covers about a 30-kilometer radius from the transmitter while the AM signal covers 160 kilometers.</p>
<p>Nancy Whalen called the AM signal "our <strong>bread and butter</strong> since the beginning."</p>
<p>The reduction in the number of AM stations has many people worried. That includes broadcasters, business owners, farmers and lawmakers. Some broadcasting companies that own AM radio stations are selling their land because it is more profitable than running a radio station.</p>
<p>Amy Klobuchar is a senator from Minnesota. She is concerned about losing AM radio stations. They keep people in her large state informed.</p>
<p>In an online <a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1673481193462063105?lang=en">video</a>, Klobuchar said AM radio "gives people the information they need in many of our <strong>rural </strong>areas..." She noted that "a lot of people drive long distances" in rural areas and listen to the radio in the car. She also said of AM radio: "This is where people find their local news."</p>
<p>Klobuchar and others are working on the "AM For Every Vehicle Act."</p>
<p>They want to keep AM radio in cars. The lawmakers say the car makers should find a way to keep AM radio.</p>
<p>When Klobuchar talks about people in rural areas, she is talking about people like Rodney Hunter. He supervises two grain storage structures, called silos, in Texas. He said farmers will listen to the radio on their way to sell grain. Without the news on AM radio, they would not know if grain prices were up or down.</p>
<p>"Farmers are in their (trucks or tractors) going up and down the road," Hunter said. He added it is easier for them to listen to the agriculture news on AM radio than to try to find the information online.</p>
<p>But the people who run AM radio stations are not just farmers and small-town business people with a sense of civic pride.</p>
<p>About five hours southeast of the grain-storage building, Joann Whang is a <strong>pharmacist</strong> who listens to KKDA-730 in Dallas, Texas. It is a Korean-language station. At first, Whang said she thought listening to a Korean station was only for old people.</p>
<p>"But it actually was pretty interesting," she said. She said she got a lot of information and even heard Korean pop songs, known as K-pop.</p>
<p>The station is owned by DK Media Group. The company also runs two Korean-language newspapers. Stephanie Min Kim is the president. She said removing AM from cars would hurt small companies like hers that broadcast in languages other than English. It is too costly to buy a license, or government permission, to broadcast in FM, she said.</p>
<p>Kim once worked for the Korean broadcaster KBS. She said, "We feel that it is our duty to help and support our Korean immigrants <strong>integrate</strong> into American society." She said her radio station hosts discussions with experts in law, healthcare and education that help people from Korea learn about life in the U.S.</p>
<p>She said, if AM is removed from cars, the transmissions face an "existential threat." That means the existence of the stations is threatened.</p>
<p>Radio Caravan is another small broadcaster in Dallas. It broadcasts in Hindi, Tamil and English on AM 700. Aparna Ragnan is a radio host. She said carmakers should find a way to keep AM.</p>
<p>Vaibhav Sheth is the station manager. He said the sound quality of the AM stations is not a problem. He said the information that the stations provide is more important than sound quality. In addition, he notes that AM stations are important in emergencies. The emergency signals go off to alert listeners about bad weather, like a tornado, or a child who is in danger.</p>
<p>"Whatever it is that's happening," he said, "it goes to the AM <strong>frequency</strong>."</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "listen" and "hear."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Hear vs. Listen" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a684-08db944445f4_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Hear vs. Listen</span></div>
<p>My name is Waleed. And I am from Egypt. I would like to ask about the difference between "hear" and "listen."</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Waleed</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing to us, Waleed.</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. Both words have to do with sounds and our ears, but they do not mean the same thing. Let's look at each.</p>
<p><strong>Hear</strong></p>
<p>"Hear" is a verb that can either take a direct object or not. It has several meanings. First, in its simplest form, the word means to receive sound through the ear.</p>
<p><em>Every few hours I hear the <strong>whistle</strong> of the train.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hear" can mean to get information or knowledge by hearing something.</p>
<p><em>I hear that we need to clean out our offices soon!</em></p>
<p>"Hear" also means to receive communication from someone.</p>
<p><em>Nathan has not heard from his mother in a while. He needs to call her.</em></p>
<p>"Hear" can share a meaning with the word "listen." To say you "hear" someone means that you listened to them with attention.</p>
<p><em>I hear your side of the story, but I do not agree.</em></p>
<p>Let's move on to "listen."</p>
<p><strong>Listen</strong></p>
<p>Just like the last meaning we gave for "hear," "listen" means to hear with attention and understanding. We often use the preposition "to" with it.</p>
<p><em>It is difficult to listen to my teacher for a long time.</em></p>
<p>"Listen" can mean paying attention to sounds or being alert enough to catch and understand sounds.</p>
<p><em>Maria listens to a lot of different kinds of music.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>My cat listens for the sound of the can-opener to know when it is dinner time.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And when speaking informally, "listen" can be a noun meaning the act of listening itself.</p>
<p><em>Give this a listen! It's Carly Rae Jepsen's new song.</em></p>
<p>The biggest difference between "hearing" something and "listening" to something is the amount of attention given to the process. "Hearing" is what we usually call a <strong>passive </strong>activity, sounds are coming into your ear, you receive them, but you are not necessarily paying attention to them. "Listening" suggests an <strong>active</strong> effort that requires attention.</p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Waleed.</p>

<p>Google is developing an artificial intelligence tool that produces news articles. And the development is troubling some experts.</p>
<p>They say such tools risk spreading propaganda or threatening the safety of people who provide reporters with information, or sources.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A ChatGPT prompt is shown on a device near a public school in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday, Jan. 5, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/06a20000-0aff-0242-32bd-08daf7d1d5d4_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A ChatGPT prompt is shown on a device near a public school in Brooklyn, New York, Thursday, Jan. 5, 2023.

<p><em>The New York Times</em> reported last week that Google is testing a new product named Genesis. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to produce news stories, or articles.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> said Genesis gathers information, like details about current events, to create news stories. Google already has <strong>pitched</strong> the product to the <em>Times</em> and other organizations, including <em>The Washington Post</em> and News Corp., which owns <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>newspaper.</p>
<p>The launch of AI chatbot ChatGPT last fall created a debate about how AI ought to be used in the news industry.</p>
<p>AI tools can help reporters research by quickly examining data from large computer files. AI can also help reporters confirm or disprove information from sources. But there is fear that AI tools could spread propaganda and cause journalists to lose the skill of reporting.</p>
<p>John Scott-Railton studies disinformation at the Citizen Lab, part of the University of Toronto. He told VOA that a lot of information gathered by AI comes from places on the internet "where disinformation and propaganda get targeted."</p>
<p>Paul M. Barrett is with New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. He agrees that AI could increase the spread of false information.</p>
<p>"It's going to be easier to generate <strong>myths</strong> and disinformation," he told VOA. "The supply of misleading <strong>content</strong> is, I think, going to go up."</p>
<p>In an emailed statement to VOA, a Google spokesperson said its tool is designed to help reporters, or journalists, in their work, not replace them. AI cannot replace the "role journalists have in reporting, creating and fact-checking their articles," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>AI tools in journalism could also hurt trust in news organizations. Public opinion researchers Gallup and the Knight Foundation released a study in February about trust in the media. It said that half of Americans believe that national news organizations try to mislead or misinform the public.</p>
<p>"I'm <strong>puzzled</strong> that anyone thinks that the solution to this problem is to introduce a much less credible tool," said Scott-Railton. He earlier received support from Google's research group Google Ideas.</p>
<p>Reports say that AI chatbots regularly produce answers that are wrong or made up. Digital experts are also concerned about the security risks of using AI tools to produce news stories.</p>
<p>Reporters would have to be careful not to reveal to AI systems information like "the identity of a <strong>confidential</strong> source, or, I would say, even information that the journalist wants to make sure doesn't become public," Barrett said.</p>
<p>Scott-Railton said he thinks AI probably could be used in most industries. But it is important not to introduce the technology too quickly, especially in the news.</p>
<p>"What <strong>scares</strong> me is that the lessons learned in this case will come at the cost of well-earned <strong>reputations</strong>, will come at the cost of factual <strong>accuracy</strong> when it actually counts," he said.</p>

            <title>Study: Heat Spreading Ocean Currents Could Collapse by Midcentury  (2023/8/4)</title>

<p>A new study has predicted that a system of ocean currents that transports warm water northward could collapse in the next 70 years.</p>
<p>Climate scientists have warned that such collapse could cause sea level rise in the U.S. and extreme weather in Europe.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, the sun rises over fishing boats in the Atlantic Ocean, Sept. 8, 2022, off of Kennebunkport, Maine.

<p>The currents spread, or circulate, water in the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/amoc.html">explains</a>. The currents carry warm water north and cold water south.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it was unlikely that ocean currents would cause disastrous conditions in the next 80 years or so.</p>
<p>However, the new study recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w">published</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> suggests that the huge ocean current system might collapse sooner than some scientists believe.</p>
<p>Altogether, the currents studied by the scientists are known as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC. It circulates water throughout the Atlantic Ocean. The circulation is very lengthy, taking an estimated 1,000 years to complete. But NOAA says the circulation has been slowing since the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The Atlantic current called the Gulf Stream is part of this huge current system, NOAA says.</p>
<p>Scientists in the United States and Germany have warned that a further slowdown or complete halt to the circulation process could create more extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere. It could also cause sea-level rise on the U.S. East Coast and <strong>drought</strong> in southern Africa. But predictions about the possible timing remain unclear.</p>
<p>In the new study, Danish researchers Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen examined sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic between 1870 and 2020. Under current conditions, they have suggested the circulation system could collapse as soon as 2025 or as late as 2095.</p>
<p>Their prediction is different from a prediction made by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021. The IPCC said the collapse was not likely to happen before 2100.</p>
<p>Julio Friedmann is chief scientist at New York City-based Carbon Direct, a carbon management company. He said in a statement he thinks the latest study makes clear that "action must be <strong>swift </strong>and <strong>profound</strong>" to reduce major climate risks.</p>
<p>Stefan Rahmstorf co-wrote a 2018 <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5">study</a> on ocean currents in the Atlantic. He also <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2023/07/what-is-happening-in-the-atlantic-ocean-to-the-amoc/">published his comments</a> about the Danish-led study on the website RealClimate. Rahmstorf noted that the timing of a collapse of Atlantic Ocean currents remains "highly <strong>uncertain</strong>."</p>
<p>He added that he finds the IPCC's estimate conservative. "Increasingly, the evidence points to the risk being far greater than 10 percent during this century," Rahmstorf wrote. He added that the problem is likely to remain "...rather worrying for the next few <strong>decades</strong>."</p>

            <title>US Agency Permits Sesame to be Added to Foods  (2023/8/4)</title>

<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently said that by law food makers are permitted to add sesame to their products. They also must identify sesame content in their foods on product <strong>packaging</strong>.</p>
<p>Sesame is the seed of the sesamum or benne plant. It is used to make oil and the seeds themselves are often used on bread or baked goods. The seeds come in black and white colors.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Sesame dinner rolls sit on a mat in Concord, N.H., on Oct. 12, 2015. (AP Photo/Matthew Mead, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/68e498de-e754-477d-951f-2392b1d6645a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Sesame dinner rolls sit on a mat in Concord, N.H., on Oct. 12, 2015. (AP Photo/Matthew Mead, File)</span></div>
<p>Sesame is used in many foods to add a nutty flavor or some <strong>crunch</strong>.</p>
<p>But the American non-profit group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), says about 1.6 million people are <strong>allergic</strong> to the seeds. Someone who is allergic can get very sick after eating the seeds. People with the allergy usually learn to stay away from traditional foods that contain sesame.</p>
<p>The CSPI is protesting to the FDA about a law that went into effect in January.</p>
<p>The Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research Act, known as FASTER, listed sesame as a major allergen requiring identification on packaging for the first time.</p>
<p>Some food companies made changes to their production centers in reaction to the new law. Some cut sesame use completely. Others, however, decided to add sesame to products that did not usually contain it. As long as they identified the sesame on the food packaging, they were obeying the law fully.</p>
<p>The CSPI and other organizations argue that adding sesame to foods that did not contain it in the past limits food choices for allergic people.</p>
<p>Some food companies say it is too hard to prevent sesame from getting into some products, or it is too costly to change their production centers. It is easier to add sesame and identify it legally.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are also adding sesame to their foods and noting it on menus or meal listings in order to meet the requirements of the food law.</p>
<p>Robert Earl is a food safety <strong>advocate</strong>. He said the <strong>practice</strong> will put people with food allergies in danger of getting sick. "It puts our community at greater risk," he said. Earl added that food companies and restaurants adding sesame to products reduces food choices.</p>
<p>Earl said his organization – Food Allergy Research and Education – has received a number of complaints from people who said they got sick by eating formerly "safe" products.</p>
<p>Ruchi Gupta is a children's doctor at Northwestern University. She is director of the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma research there. Gupta called the FDA's decision "disappointing," and noted that the food company and restaurant changes are permitted by law. However, she said she hoped the FDA would have "come out in a way to try to <strong>discourage</strong>" putting sesame in unusual products.</p>
<p>Robert Califf leads the Food and Drug Administration. In a message posted online in 2023, he wrote about companies adding sesame to their foods. He called it "a practice with an outcome we do not support." He said it does not break any rule but that it "limits <strong>options</strong> for <strong>consumers</strong> who are allergic to sesame."</p>
<p>He also noted that consumers should "check the <strong>label </strong>every time you buy a food product – even if you have eaten it before and didn't have an allergic reaction."</p>
<p>The F.D.A. also said companies cannot use language like "may contain sesame" if the product does not contain it.</p>
<p>Peter Lurie heads the CSPI. He said he hoped the FDA's recent statements would send a message to food companies. He said "it's on the companies to act responsibly," if the FDA is not going to force them to make changes.</p>

<p>What do the words "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/teen-vs-tween/7174983.html">tween</a>," "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/barbenheimer-two-movies-one-day/7187869.html">Barbenheimer</a>" and "brunch" have in common?</p>
<p>These words are portmanteaus -- words that are formed by combining parts of two separate words.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Blend Words: Portmanteaus " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-7b07-08db92c97a97_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Blend Words: Portmanteaus </span></div>
<p>But unlike compound nouns, which are formed from two words, portmanteaus combine parts of the spelling of each word <em>and</em> their meanings.</p>
<p>In this week's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will learn more about how portmanteaus are created. We will also learn about their history and find out some common portmanteaus in English.</p>
<p><strong>What are portmanteaus?</strong></p>
<p>Portmanteaus are blend words in English. They are formed from words or parts of words that are combined in some way. The spellings of the original words are combined into the new word and their meanings are blended, too.</p>
<p>At the start of this lesson, you heard the word "tween." This is is a blend of "teen" and "between." This portmanteau means the age in between childhood and the teenage years, or around 10 to 12 years old.</p>
<p>"Barbenheimer" is a blend word of the movies "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer." It is used to describe the event of seeing both movies on the same day. Both films came out in movie theaters on the same day last month.</p>
<p>And "brunch" is a common weekend meal that combines "breakfast" and "lunch." "Brunch" is often eaten in the late morning and early afternoon and includes food and drink choices from both meals.</p>
<p><strong>Why are blend words called a "portmanteau?"</strong></p>
<p>Where does the idea of portmanteaus come from?</p>
<p>We borrow the word "portmanteau" from French. "Porter" means "to carry" in French, and "manteau" in French is a coat. When both words are blended, a "portmanteau" means a large suitcase that folds in half and can carry a lot of things.</p>
<p>So how did a suitcase come to mean all blend words in English?</p>
<p>We have British writer Lewis Carroll to thank for linking the word "portmanteau" to blend words in English. Carroll wrote <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>. In his follow-up book <em>Though the Looking Glass</em>, Carroll wrote about the idea of portmanteaus.</p>
<p>In the story, Alice reads a book with a poem called "Jabberwocky." In the poem, Carroll makes up several blend words. Alice is confused so she asks another character, Humpty Dumpty, about the words. He answers, "You see, it's like a portmanteau — there are two meanings packed up into one word."</p>
<p>Just like the piece of luggage called a "portmanteau" has two sections folded into one, a portmanteau blend word carries both meanings of the original words but folds them together to create a new word.</p>
<p>Let's look at some common portmanteaus.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of portmanteaus </strong></p>
<p>Portmanteaus can be nouns, verbs or adjectives. Some portmanteaus are created by combining the beginning section, syllable or letters of the first word with the final part, syllable or letters of the second word.</p>
<p>They are often used in entertainment, for names of places, in government, for food and for technology.</p>
<p>Here are a few common portmanteaus.</p>
<p>A "biopic" is a blend of <em>"</em>bio<em>graphy" and "picture." It means a film about a person based on their life. </em></p>
<p><em>"Chillax" is a blended verb of "chill" and "relax" and means to calm down. </em></p>
<p>"Cosplay" is a combination of "costume" and "roleplay." "Cosplay" is when people dress up as characters from videogames, literature, films or television.</p>
<p>"Hangry" means to be angry because you are hungry.</p>
<p>"Motel" is a combination of "motor" and "hotel." It is like a hotel, but for people driving on long road trips.</p>
<p>"Smog" blends the words "smoke" and "fog" to create the noun that describes air pollution.</p>
<p>"Email" is a blend of "electronic" and "mail." It is the computer-based alternative to paper mail.</p>
<p>"Internet" is also a portmanteau, which combines "interconnected" and "network."</p>
<p>"Podcast" combines "iPod" with "broadcast." Podcasts are digital audio programs.</p>
<p>And lastly, we have "vlog." It is a blend of "video" and "log." These are journals that people record with a video camera and publish online.</p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<p>In today's report, we learned about "portmanteaus." Portmanteaus have an interesting history in the English language. Writer Lewis Carroll created several portmanteaus and described the term in his book,<em> Through the Looking Glass</em>. Portmanteaus blend the spelling and meanings of two words together. "Brunch," "vlog," and "hangry" are all portmanteaus.</p>
<p>Now it's your turn. Take the portmanteaus you learned today and try to use them in sentences.</p>

<p>Newly-developed artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated the ability to perform at human-like levels in some areas. But one serious problem with the tools remains – they can produce false or harmful information repeatedly.</p>
<p>The development of such systems, known as "chatbots," has progressed greatly in recent months. Chatbots have shown the ability to interact smoothly with humans and produce complex writing based on short, written commands. Such tools are also known as "<strong>generative</strong> AI" or "large language models."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, text from the ChatGPT page of the OpenAI website is shown in this photo, in New York, Feb. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9bc9-08db93742dc9_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, text from the ChatGPT page of the OpenAI website is shown in this photo, in New York, Feb. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>Chatbots are one of many different AI systems currently under development. Others include tools that can produce new images, video and music or can write computer programs. As the technology continues to progress, some experts worry that AI tools may never be able to learn how to avoid false, outdated or damaging results.</p>
<p>The term hallucination has been used to describe when chatbots produce <strong>inaccurate</strong> or false information. Generally, hallucination describes something that is created in a person's mind, but is not happening in real life.</p>
<p>Daniela Amodei is co-creator and president of Anthropic, a company that produced a chatbot called Claude 2. She told the <em>Associated Press</em>, "I don't think that there's any model today that doesn't suffer from some hallucination."</p>
<p>Amodei added that such tools are largely built "to predict the next word." With this kind of design, she said, there will always be times when the model gets information or <strong>context</strong> wrong.</p>
<p>Anthropic, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and other major developers of such AI systems say they are working to make AI tools that make fewer mistakes. Some experts question how long that process will take or if success is even possible.</p>
<p>"This isn't fixable," says Professor Emily Bender. She is a language expert and director of the University of Washington's Computational Linguistics Laboratory. Bender told the <em>AP</em> she considers the general relationship between AI tools and proposed uses of the technology a "<strong>mismatch</strong>."</p>
<p>Indian computer scientist Ganesh Bagler has been working for years to get AI systems to create <strong>recipes</strong> for South Asian foods. He said a chatbot can generate misinformation in the food industry that could hurt a food business. A single "hallucinated" recipe element could be the difference between a tasty meal or a terrible one.</p>
<p>Bagler questioned OpenAI chief Sam Altman during an event on AI technology held in India in June. "I guess hallucinations in ChatGPT are still acceptable, but when a recipe comes out hallucinating, it becomes a serious problem," Bagler said.</p>
<p>Altman answered by saying he was sure developers of AI chatbots would be able to get "the hallucination problem to a much, much better place" in the future. But he noted such progress could take years. "At that point we won't still talk about these," Altman said. "There's a balance between creativity and perfect accuracy, and the model will need to learn when you want one or the other."</p>
<p>Other experts who have long studied the technology say they do not expect such improvements to happen anytime soon.</p>
<p>The University of Washington's Bender describes a language model as a system that has been trained on written data to "model the likelihood of different strings of word forms." Many people depend on a version of this technology whenever they use the "autocomplete" tool when writing text messages or emails.</p>
<p>The latest chatbot tools try to take that method to the next level, by generating whole new passages of text. But Bender says the systems are still just repeatedly choosing the most predictable next word in a series. Such language models "are designed to make things up. That's all they do," she noted.</p>
<p>Some businesses, however, are not so worried about the ways current chatbot tools generate their results. Shane Orlick is head of marketing technology company Jasper AI. He told the AP, "Hallucinations are actually an added <strong>bonus</strong>." He explained many chatbot users were pleased that the company's AI tool had "created takes on stories or <strong>angles</strong> that they would have never thought of themselves."</p>

<p>A new fossil study by researchers from China and Canada suggests that ancient mammals may have attacked and eaten larger dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The scientists looked at a fossil found by a Chinese farmer in 2012. A fossil is the mineralized remains of an animal or plant left in an ancient rock.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration shows the Cretaceous carnivorous mammal Repenomamus robustus attacking the plant-eating dinosaur Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis moments before a volcanic debris flow buries them both about 125 million years ago in China.

(Michael W. Skrepnick/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The scientists said the fossil is from 125 million years ago. They published their findings recently in the journal <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>
<p>The scientists believe a mammal, similar to a badger, attacked a small, <strong>beaked</strong> dinosaur. During the attack, the animals were caught up in a <strong>lava</strong> flow from a nearby volcano. The moment was locked in time until it was found over 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Researchers call the place where the fossil was found "China's Pompeii." Pompeii was a city in Italy that was caught in a volcanic <strong>eruption</strong> about 2000 years ago. Ash covered the city and preserved moments from daily life. Researchers discovered the ruins of the city about 500 years ago.</p>
<p>In the past, dinosaur researchers believed small, <strong>scavenging</strong> mammals might have eaten dead dinosaurs. However, they were not sure that mammals attacked living dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Jordan Mallon is a <strong>paleobiologist</strong> at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ontario. He was one of the study's writers.</p>
<p>"I've never seen a fossil like this before," he said.</p>
<p>Steve Brusatte is a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He did not work on the study. He described the fossil as a "freeze frame" or something like a photograph.</p>
<p>"It turns the old story on its head," he said. Brusatte said the old idea was that dinosaurs ruled the world with small mammals "in the shadows."</p>
<p>Mallon said he would be happy for other scientists to examine the fossil if they are concerned that it might not be real.</p>
<p>He described the mammal as about the size of a house cat. He said the dinosaur was about the size of an average dog.</p>
<p>He said the <strong>species</strong> of dinosaur is Psittacosaurus and the mammal is called Repenomamus. The dinosaur ate plants, but other dinosaurs ate meat and hunted mammals.</p>
<p>Mallon said it would have been more common for a dinosaur to hunt a mammal, but the fossil he studied shows something new.</p>
<p>"We now know that the mammals were able to fight back, at least at times," he said.</p>

<p>A United States federal grand jury indicted former President Donald Trump on Tuesday with crimes connected to the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>The charging document, called an indictment, accuses Trump of four crimes: conspiracy to defraud the government, blocking an official meeting of Congress and plotting to do so, and threatening people's right to vote.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nadine Seiler holds a sign in front of the federal courthouse where former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later this week to answer charges in the investigation of efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat In Washington, U.S. August 1, 2023.

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)</span></div>
<p>The indictment centers on the months after the November 2020 election. It says Trump knew that he had lost the election but spread lies about the voting results as he was "<strong>determined</strong> to remain in power."</p>
<p>The former president, it says, tried and failed to use federal and state officials to overturn the election. It said he blocked the counting of electoral votes certifying Biden's victory on January 6, 2021, as thousands of his supporters attacked the Capitol building and police where the process was taking place.</p>
<p>In the announcement of the indictment, Special Counsel Jack Smith called the attack an "assault on the seat of American democracy." He added, "It was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a <strong>bedrock function</strong> of the U.S. government: the nation's process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election."</p>
<p>The document refers to six other co-conspirators it says worked with Trump to undo the election results. But the former president was the only one charged in Tuesday's indictment. He is expected to appear in court on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Other legal actions against Trump</strong></p>
<p>The latest legal action is the second time that Smith has charged Trump with criminal wrongdoing. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-indicts-former-president-donald-trump-with-crimes/7130540.html">In June, the special counsel accused Trump</a> of illegally holding classified national security documents, obstruction, making false statements, and plotting with others to carry out a crime. A trial has been set for May 2024.</p>
<p>In March, the office of the Manhattan District Attorney in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/former-us-president-trump-to-face-criminal-charges-for-first-time/7036299.html">the state of New York charged Trump</a> with criminally falsifying "business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election." That indictment made Trump the first former president to face criminal charges. That trial is set for next March.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump and his business, the Trump Organization, are being accused of misleading banks and tax officials to get loans and tax benefits. The office of the New York State Attorney General is seeking to ban Trump from doing business in the state. A trial will start in state court in October.</p>
<p>In the southern state of Georgia, a grand jury has been investigating whether Trump and his allies had tried to illegally overturn the 2020 election result in that state. In early 2021, Trump was recorded on a phone call asking Georgian state election officials to "find" him 11,780 votes, one more than Biden's winning margin, so Trump could claim the 16 electoral votes.</p>
<p>Trump is seeking reelection in 2024 and is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. He has denied wrongdoing in all cases. And his campaign attacked the latest indictment, saying it was an "attempt by the Biden Crime Family and their weaponized Justice Department" to interfere in the 2024 election.</p>

<p>From truck drivers to Hollywood actors, many workers in the United States are complaining about low pay and long hours.</p>
<p>The unhappiness is a result of changes in technology and the economy. And worker's jobs have changed as companies try to meet customer expectations for speed and ease.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - UPS workers hold placards at a rally held by the Teamsters Union on July 19, 2023 in Los Angeles, California, ahead of an August 1st deadline for an agreement on a labor contract deal.

<p><strong>Delivery drivers </strong></p>
<p>Jeffrey Palmerino is a driver for the <strong>delivery</strong> company United Parcel Service (UPS) near Albany, New York. The full-time driver said he was forced to work <strong>overtime</strong> during the pandemic to deal with a large increase in orders. And 14-hour days in trucks without air conditioning became usual.</p>
<p>"For two straight years... A lot of us were forced to work six days a week, and that is not any way to live your life," said Palmerino.</p>
<p>The working conditions led to talk of a strike by a labor group known as the Teamsters. But UPS and the Teamsters last week reached an early deal that would put off the strike. Labor activists said the deal would pressure other companies facing labor issues to raise their <strong>standards</strong>.</p>
<p>Patricia Campos-Medina is with the Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. The Institute released a report this year that found the number of U.S. labor strikes rose 52 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>"The whole idea that consumer convenience is above everything broke down during the pandemic. We started to think, ‘I'm at home ordering,'.... but there is actually a worker who has to go the grocery store, who has to cook this for me so that I can be comfortable,'" Campos-Medina said.</p>
<p><strong>Screenwriters and actors</strong></p>
<p>Some UPS drivers recently joined the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) for protests.</p>
<p>Hollywood screenwriters and actors are holding their first strikes in 40 years because the rise of <strong>streaming </strong>services has changed entertainment economics. The result has been decreased pay and faster production times with smaller teams.</p>
<p>Actors and writers have long depended on residuals, or long-term payments, for reruns and other airings of films and television shows. But reruns do not exist on streaming services, where shows and movies are available at all times.</p>
<p>There is also no easy way, such as<strong> ticket</strong> sales or ratings, to determine their popularity. As a result, streaming services often pay little for residuals.</p>
<p>Adam Shapiro is an actor known for the Netflix hit Never Have I Ever. He said many actors were happy at first to accept lower pay for the sudden increase in acting jobs that streaming services offered. But the need for better pay gained urgency when it became clear streaming is the future of the business, he said.</p>
<p>"Over the past 10 years, we realized: ‘Oh, that's now how Hollywood works. Everything is streaming,'" Shapiro said during a recent union event.</p>
<p>Shapiro said he agreed to a deal offering 20 percent of his normal pay for Never Have I Ever because it seemed like "a great <strong>opportunity</strong>, and it's going to be all over the world." He added, "Unfortunately, we're all starting to realize that if we keep doing this we're not going to be able to pay our bills."</p>
<p>Danielle Sanchez-Witzel is co-creator of the recently released Netflix show Survival of the Thickest.

However, Netflix only lets her keep one writer after pre-production to deal with any changes in the story.</p>

<p>From Intel in the United States to South Korea's Samsung, producers are celebrating the beginning of the end of the <strong>chip</strong> surplus. Still, the expectations for demand from buyers outside the artificial intelligence (AI) industry remain weak.</p>
<p><strong>Chip markets </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Semiconductor chips are seen on a circuit board of a computer in this illustration picture taken February 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fa918b34-78cb-4d29-8251-7f8024695932_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Semiconductor chips are seen on a circuit board of a computer in this illustration picture taken February 25, 2022.

<p>All the major markets for chips - smartphones, computers and data centers - have decreased this year. Both companies and people have reduced spending during a weak international economy, high inflation and rising interest rates.</p>
<p>The decreased demand has created a large oversupply of chips. The result: a record combined $12 billion first-half operating loss for the world's two largest memory chipmakers, Samsung and SK Hynix of South Korea.</p>
<p>This time of oversupply, however, has started to ease. Chip companies have cut production. And a decline in personal computer shipments eased to 11 percent in the June <strong>quarter</strong> compared to a 30 percent decrease in each of the previous two quarters, data from the research company Canalys showed.</p>
<p>The smartphone market is also looking better, with cellphone shipments falling 8 percent in the June quarter, versus 14 percent in the first quarter, says research firm Counterpoint.</p>
<p>"Demand is recovering very <strong>gradually</strong>," Woohyun Kim, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said on an earnings call last week.</p>
<p>Intel chief Pat Gelsinger recently said an oversupply in server central processing units (CPUs) will continue until the second half of the year. He also said that data center chip sales will decline in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>A slow recovery in China, the world's biggest chip buyer, is also lowering market expectations.</p>
<p>Both Samsung and SK Hynix said China's reopening failed to live up to expectations that it would bring back the smartphone market. The two companies said they were lengthening production cuts of NAND memory chips, widely used in smartphones to store digital data.</p>
<p>American chipmaker Texas Instruments, which does a lot of business in China, predicted third-quarter earnings and profit below targets last week.</p>
<p>"China was roughly half of sales at the end of fiscal 2022, so China has the largest impact on TI's (Texas Instruments) business," said Logan Purk of the investment business Edward Jones.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence </strong></p>
<p>Demand for chips to support generative artificial intelligence has increased since OpenAI's ChatGPT was launched late last year. Still, AI only accounts for a small amount of overall chip demand.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of the equipment used to make chips such as KLA Corporation and Lam Research in the U.S. are early winners of the AI boom. Both companies predicted quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates last week.</p>

<p>At about summer's halfway point, scientists say the world's record-breaking heat and weather extremes are both <strong>unprecedented</strong> and unsurprising.</p>
<p>American and European <strong>meteorologists</strong> also expect a hotter-than-normal August and September.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People swim in the ocean off of Crandon Park, July 28, 2023, in Key Biscayne, Fla (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5d9b-08db92b37b70_cx19_cy21_cw80_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - People swim in the ocean off of Crandon Park, July 28, 2023, in Key Biscayne, Fla (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)</span></div>
<p>Gavin Schmidt is a NASA climate scientist. He told <em>The Associated Press,</em> "The heat waves that we're seeing in the U.S. and in Europe, in China are <strong>demolishing</strong> records left, right and center. This is not a surprise."</p>
<p>"We're going to be seeing this pretty much this year and into next year," Schmidt said. Along with human-caused climate change, there is also the natural El Nino warming of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Here is a look at what has happened so far this summer:</p>
<p><strong>Record-breaking heat</strong></p>
<p>The month of June this year was the hottest June on record in the world. Scientists say July has been so hot that even before the month was over they could say it was the hottest month on record. In some places, the heat has been deadly.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Arizona, the last day of June and each day of July has been at least 43 degrees Celsius. The area also set records for the longest period with temperatures at 32 and higher.</p>
<p>El Paso, Texas, had 44 days of 37-degree heat. Schools closed in Nuevo Leon state in northern Mexico a month earlier than normal as temperatures reached 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Beijing, China experienced 27 days of 35 degrees in July. That came after three 40-degree days in June.</p>
<p>Heat records fell all over southern Europe. Sardinia, Italy, hit 47 degrees. Palermo in Sicily broke a record that goes back to 1791 by 2 degrees.</p>
<p>Spain reported nearly 1,000 extra deaths from the heat by mid-July, mostly among older people.</p>
<p><strong>Too much rain</strong></p>
<p>More than 10,000 people had to be <strong>evacuated</strong> in central Hunan province in China. Heavy rainfall there caused at least 70 houses to collapse. In Yichang, rain caused a landslide that buried a construction site and killed at least one person.</p>
<p>Australia's Queensland desert got 13 times its normal monthly July rain in just one day.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were evacuated from Delhi in India as rains caused floods and landslides. Heavy rain and flooding caused several deaths in northeastern states of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Wildfires and smoke</strong></p>
<p>Too little rain in Greece and Spain worsened wildfires. In the Canary Islands, a fire caused 4,000 people to evacuate and 400 firefighters battling it.</p>
<p>Hot and dry conditions caused about 160 wildfires to break out in Israel in early June.</p>
<p>In northern Quebec, Canada, wildfire smoke spread to create the world's dirtiest air in cities like New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>As of late July, more than 600 wildfires were out of control in Canada. A record 123,000 square kilometers burned, and fire season is not nearly done. That is an area larger than North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>Water temperatures</strong></p>
<p>Water temperatures in the Florida Keys and off the Everglades hit the high 30s.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic had hot spots that alarmed scientists. The world's oceans as a whole were the hottest ever in June and got even hotter in July. In Antarctica, sea ice broke record-low levels.</p>
<p>Ocean temperatures take a long time to warm up and cool down, said Victor Gensini who teaches meteorology at the University of Northern Illinois. He added that it does not look good for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>A hot forecast</strong></p>
<p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Rosencrans expects above normal temperatures for the next three months.</p>
<p>The only possible relief he sees, especially in the hot Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, is if a <strong>hurricane</strong> or tropical storm moves through. But the height of hurricane season in September has not even started.</p>
<p>With the summer's weather extremes so far, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann had one question: "How on God's Earth are we still burning <strong>fossil fuels</strong> after witnessing all this?"</p>

<p>Young people are leaving Bhutan as Australia has reopened its borders to international students after the pandemic. Young people from Bhutan are seeking opportunities outside the country as more are becoming unhappy with the South Asian kingdom's economy.</p>
<p>The number of students arriving in Australia from Bhutan has increased sharply. Over 12,000 arrived during the 11 months ending in May. That number represents about 1.5 percent of the small South Asian country's population. The country has a youth unemployment rate above 25 percent.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Buddha Dordenma statue overlooks the town of Thimphu, Bhutan, April 16, 2016.

(REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>Most of the recent arrivals have settled in Perth, Western Australia. They are taking classes in fields like childcare, <strong>hospitality</strong>, and accounting.</p>
<p>Tashi Kipchu is 25 years old. He is one of many who came to Australia last year in search of better <strong>opportunities</strong>.</p>
<p>"Right after COVID, everything died," said Kipchu, who studied marketing at the University of Western Australia. He said he did not see any opportunities at home.</p>
<p>Bhutanese students did not start going to Australia until 2017. The number sharply increased after Australia reopened its borders in 2022. Australian government data shows that the number of Bhutanese students asking for visas increased by five times in the financial year ending in June.</p>
<p>The increase of student arrivals has made Australia home to one of the largest Bhutanese communities outside of South Asia.</p>
<p>Bhutanese students represent just a small part of Australia's 600,000 international student population. But the increase of students comes as the $27 billion education industry in Australia tries to make up lost ground from the decrease during the pandemic. Students from China, for example, are returning at a slower rate than Australian officials had hoped.</p>
<p>Phil Honeywood is Chief Executive Officer at International Education Association of Australia. He said Australian universities want to <strong>diversify</strong>. Honeywood said they got the message from the former and current government that they should not depend too much on China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>Sonam Tobgay is Bhutan's ambassador to Australia. He said students want to go to Australia for a less costly education and visas that permit students' dependents to work for unlimited hours.</p>
<p>Bhutan's mostly closed economy is dependent on hydropower and <strong>tourism</strong>. Its economy has more recently been hurt by high energy costs and limited trade.</p>
<p>Government reforms have added to the number of working professionals leaving.</p>
<p>Found between India and China, Bhutan reopened its borders last September. But higher taxes on tourism have slowed the country's recovery. Youth unemployment hit 28 percent last year.</p>
<p>Bhutan might be most famous for its Gross National Happiness index. It is a measure of citizens' happiness rather than the country's wealth.</p>
<p>Kipchu trained as a chemical engineer in Bhutan. But he saw a business opportunity soon after arriving in Perth and started an education <strong>consultancy</strong> to help students from Bhutan. Now, his company employs 40 to 50 people in his home country. </p>
<p>"I came to Australia to study but somehow this country gave me an opportunity," said Kipchu. He predicted that the increase of people moving to Australia would continue.</p>
<p>"The job opportunities and the <strong>flexibility</strong> for students to work here makes it more <strong>attractive</strong>."</p>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">01 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Spoken language is made up of sounds. If students want to read, they must be aware of the sound-language connection.</p>
<p><strong>Phonological awareness</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Sound-language Awareness" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-0c17-08db82595aea_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Sound-language Awareness</span></div>
<p>The ability to hear sounds in language and work with them is called phonological awareness. Phonological awareness begins with easy skills and moves to more difficult ones. It is important to note that the development of these skills may <strong>overlap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Phonemic awareness</strong></p>
<p>The smallest part of the spoken language is called a <strong>phoneme</strong>.</p>
<p>A student with phonemic awareness can hear individual sounds and work with them. Phonemic awareness also allows students to understand that the sounds of spoken language work together to make words.</p>
<p>We will talk about phonemic awareness a little later in this article. But for now, know that it is the most advanced type of phonological awareness.</p>
<p><strong>What does phonological awareness look like? </strong></p>
<p><u>Students with early phonological awareness can: </u></p>
<ul>
<li>find and make rhymes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>count words in a sentence</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>count the number of beats (or <strong>syllables</strong>) in a word</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Students with advanced Phonological Awareness can: </u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>blend</strong> small sounds into words</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same first sounds, like <strong>t</strong>oe and <strong>t</strong>ip</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same ending sounds, like su<strong>n</strong> and bi<strong>n </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>hear the same middle sounds, like b<strong>a</strong>g and t<strong>a</strong>g</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for phonological awareness</strong></p>
<p>It is important to know the difference between the name of a letter and the sound of a letter. A letter between two slashes // shows its sound. So, the letter "t"<em> </em>between two slashes represents the sound /t/.</p>
<p><u>Students should learn each letter by its sound.</u></p>
<p>At an early stage, say the sound of the letter, not the letter name. This will help students blend words later on. For example, when teaching the letter "n" say /n/ as in "net", not /en/.</p>
<p><u>When teaching letter sounds, do not add vowel sounds.</u></p>
<p>For example, when saying the letter "f," do not say the sound /ef/. Just say /f/. Adding the /e/ vowel sound at the beginning of the letter makes it harder to blend the sounds in a word later. The most common example is the letter "s." Simply say /s/. Do not say /es/. Students later may say /e/school, /e/scared, /e/snake –- which would be incorrect.</p>
<p><u>Teach easier consonants first.</u></p>
<p>Some languages lack some sounds, such as /f/ and /v/. Don't teach those to your students first. Some consonants are easier to say. You can stretch them out, saying them for a longer amount of time. They are m, s, f, l, r, n, v, z.</p>
<p>Some consonants end sharply with a puff of air. They are a little harder to say. They are b, c, d, g, p, t, k, and j. Some consonants are simply difficult to say and are less common. Teach them last. They are h, w, y, x, q.</p>
<p>However, some English sounds do not exist in other languages. If students have trouble with some sounds, teach easier ones first.</p>
<p><u>Teach short vowel sounds first.</u></p>
<p>Long vowel sounds may be easier to say. But short vowel sounds are in many easy words, such as "mat" and "sun." However, short vowel sounds can be very confusing. So, first teach them separately – then altogether.</p>
<p><strong>What does phonemic awareness look like?</strong></p>
<p>As we said earlier, phonemic awareness is the most advanced type of phonological awareness.</p>
<p>Students with phonemic awareness can do the following:</p>
<p><u>Sound <strong>isolation</strong></u></p>
<p>They can hear a single sound in a word and isolate it.</p>
<p>TEACHER: What is the first sound in "bug?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: The first sound in "bug" is /b/.</p>
<p><u>They can identify and group sounds (or phonemes).</u></p>
<p>Students can identify sounds that are the same. These sounds may come at the beginning, the middle, or the end of words. Identifying middle sounds is more advanced than identifying beginning or ending sounds.</p>
<p><u>They can break apart sounds (also called <strong>segmenting</strong> phonemes.)</u></p>
<p>Segmenting is the ability to break a word into smaller sounds.</p>
<p>TEACHER: How many sounds in "flag?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: /f/ /l/ /a/ /g/ -- "Flag" has four sounds!</p>
<p><u>They can blend sounds together (also called blending phonemes).</u></p>
<p>Blending is the ability to say separate sounds together to make a word.</p>
<p>TEACHER: What word is this -- /b/ /a/ /g/?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Bag!</p>
<p>Blending and segmenting are the most important phonemic awareness skills. These are two phonemic awareness skills most linked to fluency. Both segmenting and blending should be practiced regularly.</p>
<p><u>They can lose a sound to make new words (also called deletion.)</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Pin. If I take away the /p/ sound, what do I have left?</p>
<p>STUDENT: In!</p>
<p><u>They can add a sound to make new words (also called addition.)</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Lap. If I add the /f/ sound to the beginning, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Flap!</p>
<p><u>They can change a sound to make new words (also called substitution).</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: If I take away the /s/ in "sat" and add /p/, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Pat!</p>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for phonemic awareness</strong></p>
<p><u>Use words your students know.</u></p>
<p>When doing phonemic awareness activities with your class, use words from a story your students are currently reading. It is helpful to use words the students already know.</p>
<p><u>Focus on sounds not the letters.</u></p>
<p>The focus of phonemic activities should be on the sounds of words and not on the letters or spelling. However, you can teach phonemic awareness while teaching meaning and pronunciation.</p>
<p>Identify sounds that are different or the same in the home language in comparison to English.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for Phonological Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Students with poor phonemic awareness skills cannot do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>isolate single sounds in a word;</li>
<li>break up (or segment) single sounds in a word: paper /pa/-/per/;</li>
<li>blend sounds into words: /s/ /a/ /t/ = sat;</li>
<li>add, delete, or substitute sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some questions for assessing phonological awareness.</p>
<p><u>Count words in a spoken sentence</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: How many words are in this sentence? "You are my friend."</p>
<p>STUDENT: Four!</p>
<p><u>Do They Rhyme?</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Do these words rhyme: "bit," "sit?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: Yes!</p>
<p>TEACHER: Do the words "big" and "bag" rhyme?</p>
<p>STUDENT: No!</p>
<p><u>Syllable</u><u> blending</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: I am going to say a word in parts. Listen: /o/ - /pen/. What word did I say?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Open!</p>
<p><u>Syllable <strong>deletion</strong></u></p>
<p>TEACHER: Say "sat" without the /at/.</p>
<p>STUDENT: /s/</p>
<p><u>Syllable substitution</u></p>
<p>TEACHER: If I take the /s/ away from "sit" and replace it with /p/, what word do I have?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Pit!</p>
<p>Use the tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve your learners. Change them to fit your students and your teaching situation.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 people in the United States have become <strong>allergic</strong> to red meat since 2010 in reaction to tick bites, the government reports.</p>
<p>Medical researchers say they believe many more people have the allergy and do not know it.</p>
<p>The National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two reports on the subject recently.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated photo provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a female Lone Star tick, is found mainly in the Southeast.

<p>Ticks are very small animals that feed on the blood of other animals.</p>
<p>One report estimated that as many as 450,000 Americans have developed the meat allergy. That would make it the 10th most common food allergy in the U.S., said Dr. Scott Commins. The University of North Carolina researcher co-wrote both reports.</p>
<p>Health officials said they do not know of any confirmed deaths. However, people with the allergy have described it as strange and terrifying.</p>
<p>"I never connected it with any food because it was hours after eating," said one patient, Bernadine Heller-Greenman.</p>
<p>The reaction, called alpha-gal syndrome, happens when an infected person eats beef, pork, or other meat of mammals. Taking in other mammal products, such as milk, also causes the reaction.</p>
<p>A sugar called alpha-gal exists in mammal meat and in the <strong>saliva</strong> of ticks. When the sugar enters the body through the skin, the body's own defense, or immune, system reacts too strongly.</p>
<p>Scientists saw such reactions in patients taking a cancer drug that was made in mouse cells containing the alpha-gal sugar. But in 2011 researchers first reported that it could spread through tick bites, too.</p>
<p>They tied it to the lone star tick. Scientists say the ticks live mainly in the eastern and southern U.S.</p>
<p>One of the studies released recently examined test results from the main U.S. private laboratory looking for alpha-gal antibodies. Those tests showed the number of people who had the antibodies rose from about 13,000 in 2017 to 19,000 in 2022.</p>
<p>Experts say cases may have increased for several reasons. They say the lone star tick population is expanding. They also suggest more doctors might be learning about the disease and ordering tests for it.</p>
<p>But many doctors are not.</p>
<p>The second study was based on a <strong>survey</strong> last year of 1,500 U.S. general care doctors and health professionals. It found nearly half of them had never heard of alpha-gal syndrome, and only five percent said they felt very sure they could identify it. Researchers used that information to estimate the number of people with the allergy — 450,000.</p>
<p>People with this condition can experience <strong>symptoms</strong> including <strong>hives</strong>, <strong>nausea</strong>, <strong>vomiting</strong>, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the lips, throat, tongue or eyes. Unlike some other food allergies, which happen soon after eating, these reactions hit hours later.</p>
<p>Some patients have only stomach symptoms. The American Gastroenterological Association says people with unexplained diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain should be tested for the syndrome.</p>
<p>Doctors advise people with the allergy to stop eating meat and other foods that cause the reaction and to have <strong>epinephrine </strong>available to them at all times. And, doctors say, avoid tick bites.</p>
<p>The allergy can go away in some people. Commins said he has seen that happen in about 15 to 20 percent of his patients. Staying free of tick bites is extremely important.</p>
<p>"The tick bites are central to this. They <strong>perpetuate</strong> the allergy," he said.</p>
<p>One of his patients is Heller-Greenman, a 78-year-old art historian in New York. She spends summers on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. She said she is used to getting bitten by ticks on the island. She has had Lyme disease, also caused by tick bites, four times.</p>
<p>About five years ago, Heller-Greenman started experiencing terrible, itchy hives on her back, middle and legs in the middle of the night. Her doctors decided it was an allergic reaction but could not identify the cause.</p>
<p>She never ate a lot of meat, but one day in January 2020 she had two beef meals in a row. Six hours after eating the second, she woke up nauseated, then vomited, had diarrhea and a lack of balance, or dizziness. She <strong>passed out</strong> three times.</p>
<p>Doctors identified alpha-gal syndrome as the cause soon after the incident. Heller-Greenman was told to avoid ticks and to stop eating red meat and milk products. There have been no allergic reactions since.</p>
<p>"I have one grandchild that watches me like a hawk," she said, making sure she reads food <strong>labels</strong> and avoids foods that could cause a reaction.</p>
<p>"I feel very lucky, really, that this has worked out for me," she said. "Not all doctors are knowledgeable about this."</p>

<p>In her latest gardening story, Jessica Damiano tells of the <strong>garden</strong> <strong>pests</strong> and diseases she has seen in her plants.</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press </em>writer suggests acting quickly when combatting garden pests and diseases. When not dealt with quickly, pests and diseases can quickly grow and reproduce. That can result in less plant growth and worse health, less flower and fruit production, or even death of your plants.</p>
<p>Her measure always begins with the gentlest treatment possible. She only intensifies her treatments when necessary. Even then, she has her limits. Damiano says she would rather lose a flower or vegetable plant than use strong chemicals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This July 5, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a scarlet lily beetle on an Asiatic lily stem on Long Island, N.Y.(Jessica Damiano via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1132a559-a88a-4262-907b-3501ce93cbdf_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This July 5, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a scarlet lily beetle on an Asiatic lily stem on Long Island, N.Y.(Jessica Damiano via AP)</span></div>
<p>In the case of her tomato plants, Damiano caught the aphids, a pest, early. She washed them off and removed the ones that would not come off by using her fingers under moving water. They have not returned in the week since removing them, but she looks out for them every day, just in case.</p>
<p>Had the invasion been severe or the water and finger removal method been ineffective, she would have used Neem oil. The organic oil, which comes from the seeds of the Neem tree, kills aphids by not permitting them to breathe. It is safe to use on plants that will be eaten and it is not harmful to people, animals, and birds. Still, it should be used after the sun has set when helpful insects are less active.</p>
<p>The same day Damiano found the aphids, she found another pest called scarlet lily beetles on her Asiatic lily plants. The adult red insects feed on a grouping of plants called true lilies and fritillaries.</p>
<p>In an earlier <strong>stage</strong> of life, called the larval stage, they cover themselves in waste. This makes them less appealing to those that would want to eat them. But the coating also protects them from chemicals, making them difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The pests had already damaged some of her plants. To prevent more damage, she removed them by <strong>tapping</strong> them off of the plant into some water with soap and vinegar, or household cleaners.</p>
<p>Her rhododendron, a flowering plant, were attacked by a pest called azalea bark scale last summer. She saw the white insects had come back this year. Some of the leaves were <strong>infested</strong>, so she cut them off. But because most of the leaves only had a few of the pests, she was able to remove them by touching each insect with some rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>By working early, Damiano slowed or stopped infestations that could have killed her plants. The same would be true for diseases, many of which also respond better to early treatments.</p>

<p>A Pakistani mountaineering official says a Norwegian woman and her Nepali Sherpa guide have completed the fastest climb of the world's 14 highest mountains.</p>
<p>Kristin Harila, age 37, and her guide Tenjen Sherpa, age 35, reached the top of the final mountain, K2, last Thursday.</p>
<p>All the <strong>peaks</strong> the two reached are above 8,000 meters, said Karrar Haidri, the secretary at the Pakistan Alpine Club.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Norwegian climber Kristin Harila, 37, right, and her guide Tenjen Sherpa pose for a photograph in Kathmandu, Nepal, Tuesday, June 6, 2023.

(AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)</span></div>
<p>"A big congratulations to Kristin Harila and Tenjen Sherpa on this remarkable achievement," said Haidri, adding, "They did it in 92 days."</p>
<p>The former record-holder, Nirmal Purja, a Nepali-born British citizen, climbed the 14 peaks in 189 days in 2019.</p>
<p>Most mountain climbers spend years trying to climb the world's greatest peaks.</p>
<p>Both climbers topped Shishapangma in the Tibet area of China on April 26. They have since climbed Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Annapurna in Nepal before going to Pakistan, where they climbed Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II and the Broad Peak before topping K2.</p>
<p>The company Seven <strong>Summit</strong> Treks (SST) provided support for the climbers' efforts.</p>
<p>Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering company is also on K2 leading a different group. He said the climbers used a window of good weather to go to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>"They have made a summit a short while ago," Madison told Reuters, adding that the Norwegian woman was "extremely <strong>tough</strong> mentally and physically."</p>
<p>Harila first attempted to break the record and climb all 14 top peaks in 2022. However, China restricted foreign climbers during the coronavirus pandemic so Harila was unable to attempt two of the 14 peaks.</p>
<p>K2 has one of the deadliest records for mountaineers, with most deaths happening on the return down. Any wrong move can cause an avalanche, or snowslide, and kill. Only a few hundred climbers have successfully reached its summit.</p>
<p>And one more climber made that list and set another record on Thursday, reported SST director Tashi Lakpa Sherpa. Seventeen-year-old Nima Rinjin Sherpa became the youngest person to climb K2, Tashi said.</p>

一个国际小组正在努力转移停泊在红海也门海岸一艘油轮上的石油。</p>
<p>The oil tanker, called the SOF Safer, has not been used for at least eight years. It contains over 1 million barrels of oil.<br/>
这艘萨菲尔号油轮已经至少8年没有使用了。它装载了100多万桶石油。</p>
<p>Experts say the ship is at risk of breaking up or exploding.<br/>
专家说，这艘船有发生破裂或爆炸的危险。</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported in 2020 that seawater entered the ship's engine room and caused damage. The water also put the ship in danger of sinking.<br/>
美联社2020年报道称，海水进入该船的机舱并造成损坏。这些积水也使这艘船面临沉没的危险。</p>
<p>For years, the United Nations and governments of nearby countries warned that an explosion or oil leak could disrupt shipping in the Middle East. The ship is close to the Yemeni ports of Hodeida and Ras Issa. Many ships travel from the Persian Gulf, past Yemen and through Egypt's Suez Canal to get to the Mediterranean Sea.<br/>
多年来，联合国和周边国家政府一直警告说，爆炸或石油泄漏可能会扰乱中东的航运。该船靠近也门荷台达港和拉斯伊萨港。许多船只从波斯湾出发，经过也门，通过埃及苏伊士运河到达地中海。</p>
<p>The United Nations purchased another oil tanker so crews could move the oil from the Safer.<br/>
联合国购买了另一艘油轮，以便船员能够从萨菲尔号上转移石油。</p>
<p>Antonio Guterres is the UN Secretary General. In a statement, he said the work is a "critical next step in avoiding an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe."<br/>
安东尼奥·古特雷斯是联合国秘书长。他在一份声明中表示，这项工作是“避免环境和人道主义灾难的关键一步”。</p>
<p>The U.N. said the job will be done in less than three weeks.<br/>
联合国表示，这项工作将在三周内完成。</p>
<p>The Safer was built in the 1970s and sold to the Yemeni government in the 1980s so it could move oil pumped from the fields in Marib.<br/>
萨菲尔号建造于20世纪70年代，并于20世纪80年代出售给也门政府，以便运送从马里卜油田开采的石油。</p>
<p>The U.N. said a leak could have been worse than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, one of the largest ecological disasters.<br/>
联合国表示，若发生泄漏，可能比1989年埃克森瓦尔迪兹号油轮泄漏更严重，这次事故是最大的生态灾难之一。</p>
<p>When the oil is removed, the work will not be over, however. The Safer will be anchored to an underwater oil pipeline before it is taken away to a scrapyard.<br/>
但是当石油被转移后，工作不会结束。萨菲尔号在被送往废料场之前，将被锚定在水下输油管道上。</p>
<p>David Gressly is the U.N. humanitarian official for Yemen. He said moving the oil will prevent a "worst-case scenario." Guterres said, cleaning up an oil spill in Yemen could have cost "tens of billions of dollars."<br/>
大卫·格雷斯利是联合国也门人道主义事务官员。他说，转移石油能防止“最坏的情况”。古特雷斯说，若也门发生石油泄漏进行清理，可能需要“数百亿美元”。</p>

            <title>GPS Data Could Predict Earthquakes Hours Ahead  (2023/7/31)</title>

<p>Researchers say they have identified earth movement signals that could predict earthquakes up to two hours before they hit.</p>
<p>The signals were recorded, or detected, by <strong>GPS</strong> collection devices. The devices were positioned in areas where major earthquakes had struck in the past.</p>
<p>Scientists noted, however, that the right equipment does not currently exist to use the data to predict earthquakes. But if the sensitivity of current GPS measuring devices can be improved, the researchers say a new earthquake warning system could be possible.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt=" In this March 27, 2011 file photo, a man walks through an earthquake destroyed neighborhood below Weather Hill in Natori, Japan. (AP Photo/Wally Santana, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-3bf2-08db8f86bb4d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption"> In this March 27, 2011 file photo, a man walks through an earthquake destroyed neighborhood below Weather Hill in Natori, Japan. (AP Photo/Wally Santana, File)</span></div>
<p>Earthquakes are caused by movements, or slips, in existing faults under Earth's surface, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquake-facts-earthquake-fantasy#:~:text=An%20earthquake%20is%20the%20ground,we%20feel%20during%20an%20earthquake.">explains</a>. A fault is a long break in rock attached to Earth's crust. When tension builds up along a fault, energy waves are released and travel through the crust. This causes the ground to shake.</p>
<p>Technology for predicting earthquakes currently remains very limited. But the USGS does have equipment that can pick up seismic data when an earthquake is just starting. The term seismic relates to earthquake activity.</p>
<p>The USGS method makes it possible to warn people in areas where seismic activity is expected. But this method generally can only provide a warning several seconds before an earthquake hits. The USGS system is called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.shakealert.org/">ShakeAlert</a>. It has already been deployed along the U.S. West Coast. That is where the majority of earthquakes happen in the country.</p>
<p>But the new detection method could produce warnings up to two hours before the damaging effects of an earthquake are felt. Such a system could save lives by giving people the chance to get out of buildings that might collapse in an earthquake.</p>
<p>Two scientists from France's National Research Institute for Sustainable Development carried out a study that described the latest results. The findings recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg2565">appeared</a> in the publication <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers examined GPS data collected before and after past earthquake events around the world. The data was collected on 90 earthquakes measuring larger than 7 on the Richter scale. The study period covered the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The team identified a <strong>pattern</strong> of fault movements as they examined the data collected from different areas. The movement signals were recorded within two hours of an earthquake striking. The researchers said the study demonstrates that faults generally begin to move about two hours before a large earthquake.</p>
<p>Scientists had identified such signals before single earthquakes in the past. But until now, researchers were not able to link those signals to all seismic events.</p>
<p>While the data identified this pattern, the scientists said the instruments that could capture GPS data in real time do not currently exist.</p>
<p>The National Research Institute for Sustainable Development issued a statement on the development. It said that in order to make predictions, researchers "would need to measure signals at least 10 times smaller than what we can presently do."</p>
<p>Another way to possibly build a better earthquake prediction system would be to develop "dense measurement networks" that sit very close to faults. However, such an effort would require major technological progress, the institute said.</p>
<p>Quentin Bletery is a geophysicist at C<i></i>244;te d'Azur University in the city of Nice. Bletery worked together on the study with Jean-Mathieu Nocquet, another researcher at the university.</p>
<p>Bletery <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/warning-signs-detected-hours-ahead-big-earthquakes">told</a> <em>Science</em> that the study found that no observable movement was identified in the first 46 hours leading up to an earthquake. But starting around two hours before an earthquake, the GPS signals recording movement started to increase.</p>
<p>To confirm its findings, the team compared that data to more than 100,000 <strong>random</strong> time periods recorded when no earthquakes were reported. That experiment found that similar patterns in non-earthquake areas happened just 0.03 percent of the time.</p>
<p>"This tells us earthquakes are predictable in nature," Bletery told <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>The scientists note that more research is needed to support their findings. Much of the information used in the latest study, for example, depended heavily on data from GPS stations near major earthquake sites.</p>

<p>More restaurants in Japan are offering bugs in their dishes.</p>
<p>On a recent vacation in Tokyo, Takumi Yamamoto ate a special lunch of cricket curry and silkworm sashimi, which is usually made with raw fish. He drank a water bug <strong>cider</strong>.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old office worker is one of many people around the world with a growing interest in entomophagy, or the practice of eating insects. Bugs are slowly becoming more usable as a food source.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Shunnosuke Suga eats beetle larvae, as he eats Almond tofu with beetle larvae at Take-Noko cafe in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2023. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-c3c8-08db8ece982a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Shunnosuke Suga eats beetle larvae, as he eats Almond tofu with beetle larvae at Take-Noko cafe in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2023.

<p>Yamamoto said he sometimes ate grasshoppers dipped in soy sauce as a child. In Tokyo, he ate insect foods at Take-Noko cafe, which serves many bug dishes.</p>
<p>"It's fun to select from a wider variety of dishes," Yamamoto said. "Everything was tasty. In particular, the water bug <strong>cider</strong> was quite refreshing ... like a green apple."</p>
<p>Entomophagy started to be taken seriously after the United Nations declared bugs a good source of protein to feed a growing world population. With livestock farming's effects on climate change and world hunger issues from weather and war, there has been more interest in the nutrition bugs can provide.</p>
<p>Some people think eating insects is just <strong>gross</strong>. But Japan has a rich history of using insects as food.</p>
<p>Grasshoppers, silkworms and wasps were traditionally eaten in areas of the country with little meat and fish. It was a <strong>practice</strong> that grew in popularity because of food shortages during and after World War II, said Take-Noko <strong>manager</strong> Michiko Miura.</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been advances in <strong>rearing</strong> things like crickets and mealworms for food, so the possibility of using insects as ingredients is really growing," she added. Several companies in Japan sell cakes and <strong>snacks</strong> made from cricket flour.</p>
<p>Interest has also grown at Take-Noko, which is often fully <strong>reserved</strong> on weekends.</p>
<p>The restaurant's curry contains crickets in meatball form. The "sashimi" is the left-over shell of silkworms, and the cider contains water bug <strong>extract</strong> and is topped with a whole insect.</p>
<p>Takeo Saito started the restaurant. He also has a <strong>packaged</strong> food company that offers more than 60 kinds of bug foods, from scorpions to tarantulas.</p>
<p>"Our aim is not for insects to be something separate, but to be enjoyed at the same table as vegetables, fish, and meat," Saito said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">30 July 2023</span><br/>
<p><span style="color:black">New kinds of drinks like smoothies, lattes, beers, and cocktails have become popular in recent years. Now a place in Dubai is serving what it claims to be "<strong>gourmet</strong> water."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Thirty different kinds of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">The Aqua Water Bar by Luqel gets its water the traditional way – from the pipe that runs water to your house. The government of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates says water from the pipe, called tap water, is safe to drink and meets international standards. But people in the Middle Eastern city still prefer bottled water.</span></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Roia Jabari, managing director of AQUA Water Bar by LUQEL poses at her store in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7c789374-f0f3-4e22-b76b-a4f4a7a82a82_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Roia Jabari, managing director of AQUA Water Bar by LUQEL poses at her store in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)</span></div>
<p><span style="color:black">The water at Aqua Water Bar is said to be different. The <strong>bar</strong> says it injects a very small amount of minerals, called micro-dosing, into the water. The system is designed by the German water filtration company Luqel. And its water is compared to costly water like Alpine or Arctic-sourced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Roia Jabari is a director at Aqua Water. She said experts have designed its water to fit your "needs and <strong>mood</strong>." And she added, "We can give you the perfectly mineralized <strong>recipe</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">One drink, "Runners Heaven," is high in sodium and potassium to help runners after being in the desert heat. Another, "Vegan's Choice," offers minerals that could be lacking when not eating meat. Buyers can fill up their bottles with any of the mineral combinations for around 50 cents per 500 milliliters or pay more for a nonalcoholic mixed drink. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">It is not an entirely new idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">A water bar serving what it said was heavily <strong>filtered</strong> New York City tap water opened in the city's East Village area in 2012. It received heavy criticism. Another briefly opened in Washington, DC in 2019. It also did not get the best <strong>reviews</strong>. Neither appears to have stayed open for very long. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">But Dubai, a modern city built on desert sands, could be such a place for the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Alcohol is available in bars in the UAE, but the Muslim country's population does not drink alcohol. As a center of international business, it brings in wealthy, health-centered people who support the wellness industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Although Aqua Water is often visited by businessmen who work in the surrounding Dubai Media City, Jabari says that the bar is not just for wealthy buyers. She says the water, which sells for 54 cents per 500 milliliters, is not too costly. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">To help the environment, buyers can either fill their own bottles or buy a reusable one starting at around $2.50. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Early reviews appear to be good, with the bar having 4.6 stars on Google reviews based on around 12 reviews. "(The water) was actually different," said Bilal Rizvi, who stopped in to try it out recently. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Jabari was born in San Diego, California, and is a designer who has lived in the UAE for 24 years. She designed the bar around ideas based on water. Additionally, the bar also serves Persian food as a way to honor her ancestry. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Jabari hopes to expand the business. She sees room for growth in neighboring countries. She said, "Saudi Arabia is a huge market for us. I believe that Abu Dhabi is our next step."</span></p>

            <title>Churches in Europe See Record Numbers of Visitors  (2023/7/31)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">30 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Famous Christian religious places in southern Europe are seeing record numbers of visitors. But not everyone is happy about the large crowds. Church leaders are finding it difficult to balance the needs of <strong>tourists</strong> and the people who come to pray.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with more visitors</strong></p>
<p>This spring, the Vatican opened a separate "pathway" starting outside St. Peter's Basilica for those who want to take part in religious services. St. Peter's spokesperson Roberta Leone said officials made the change because of long lines for the 55,000 daily visitors.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Tourist line up to enter at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona on July 18, 2023. (Photo by Pau BARRENA / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2b4eea31-f993-40c1-ad81-5c822d176e34_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Tourist line up to enter at the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona on July 18, 2023. (Photo by Pau BARRENA / AFP)</span></div>
<p>The Vatican's move is an example of what many churches are doing. They have tourists and religious people go separate ways. Religious services are sometimes held in different places. And sometimes tourists are not permitted at worship times.</p>
<p>With an estimated 330 million people visiting religious places yearly around the world, religious tourism is one of the largest parts of the tourism market.</p>
<p>Worshippers often come because celebrated churches generally have more services than regular churches. They need to be able to enter at no cost. Tourists often pay fees that are important for churches to maintain their buildings.</p>
<p>Daniel Olsen of Brigham Young University in Utah studies religious tourism. Olsen said of the situation, "It's just really hard because you also want people to experience your faith."</p>
<p><strong>Different opinions</strong></p>
<p>Some religious people are unhappy with the large numbers of visitors.</p>
<p>After the ceremony of <strong>Mass</strong> in the burial area of the Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, Spain, Joan Albaiges said, "The <strong>temple</strong> needs to be a place for services and not a <strong>theme park</strong>."</p>
<p>He praised the policy change in recent years to celebrate one Sunday Mass at the main<strong> altar</strong>.</p>
<p>But there is such demand for the 800 free tickets that several hundred people waiting often do not get in, said Josep Maria Turull. Turull is the <strong>rector</strong> at Sagrada Familia who also oversees tourism for the local church organization.</p>
<p>Religious leaders say the histories of the sacred buildings should be presented to visitors. These visitors increasingly do not know about faith traditions in churches.</p>
<p>José Fernández Lago is rector of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Filled with beautiful art, Santiago's<strong> cathedral </strong>draws hundreds of thousands of tourists and religious visitors known as pilgrims.</p>
<p>To remain a special place for religious pilgrims, Lago said, the cathedral does not charge money for entry. The cathedral also does not limit visitor numbers or require people to wear <strong>formal</strong> clothing.</p>
<p>But visits are not permitted during the four daily Masses celebrated at the main altar. And priests as well as security guards always have to ask visitors to lower their voices so that worshipers can pray in peace.</p>
<p>"Some people go to the cathedral, and they don't realize they're in a church," Lago observed. He added, "It's a situation that's developing in nations that were majority Christian, and now faith is cooling off."</p>

            <title>NASA Offers Satellite Technology to Help Fight Amazon Deforestation  (2023/7/30) | 美国宇航局向巴西提供卫星技术帮助对抗亚马逊森林砍伐</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The American space agency NASA has offered its satellite technology to Brazil to help identify destruction in the Amazon rainforest.<br/>
美国宇航局向巴西提供卫星技术帮助确定亚马逊雨林的破坏情况。</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson made the offer during a recent trip to Brazil. The NASA chief visited the country's space agency – the National Institute for Space Research – in the southeastern city of Jose dos Campos. Nelson's trip to South America also included visits to Argentina and Colombia.<br/>
美国宇航局局长比尔·纳尔逊在最近的巴西之行中提出了这一提议。纳尔逊访问了位于该国东南部城市何塞·多斯坎波斯的巴西国家太空研究院。纳尔逊的南美之行还包括对阿根廷和哥伦比亚的访问。</p>
<p>Brazilian Science Minister Luciana Santos showed Nelson around the institute and explained some of the space agency's programs.<br/>
巴西科技部长卢西亚娜·桑托斯陪同纳尔逊参观了该研究院，并解释了该航天机构的一些项目。</p>
<p>During a news conference, Nelson described one new NASA satellite that he said would be completed by January. He said the satellite, called NISAR, will even be able to capture images of what is happening in real time below the forest cover.<br/>
纳尔逊在新闻发布会上谈到了美国宇航局的一颗新卫星，他说这颗卫星将于明年1月完工。他说，这颗名为NISAR的卫星甚至能够捕获森林覆盖下的实时图像。</p>
<p>"It is going to be able to look through the canopy of the jungle so that we can see if someone has burned the undergrowth and that would ultimately kill the big trees," Nelson said.<br/>
纳尔逊说：“它将能够穿透丛林的树冠观察，这样我们就可以看到是否有人烧毁了灌木丛，这样做最终会毁灭大树。”</p>
<p>NASA says the new satellite will support a project called SERVIR Amazonia. It helps provide Earth science data to scientists and decision-makers across the Amazon area to record environmental changes in near real-time. The project helps predict climate threats like deforestation and food insecurity. It can also provide data to emergency workers during natural disasters.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，这颗新卫星将支持一个名为SERVIR Amazonia的项目。它有助于向亚马逊地区的科学家和决策者提供地球科学数据，以近乎实时地记录环境变化。该项目有助于预测气候威胁，如森林砍伐和粮食不安全。它还可以在自然灾害期间为应急人员提供数据。</p>
<p>Brazil's space agency has launched a series of satellites in partnership with China since 1999. Those satellites aim to gather data on agricultural operations and the environment.<br/>
自1999年以来，巴西航天机构与中国合作发射了一系列卫星。这些卫星旨在收集有关农业经营和环境的数据。</p>
<p>Brazil depends on satellite imagery to watch over the Amazon. But cloud cover often makes it difficult for satellites to capture clear and timely images. The NASA chief said the satellites NASA plans to place into orbit early next year will add an "extreme ability to understand what is happening" to the rainforest.<br/>
巴西依靠卫星图像来监视亚马逊。但云层覆盖往往使卫星难以捕捉到清晰及时的图像。纳尔逊表示，美国宇航局计划明年初将这颗卫星送入轨道，它将为雨林增加一种“了解正在发生的事情的极限能力”。</p>
<p>Nelson, a former U.S. senator who once flew to space, also met with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia. After the meeting, he told reporters he thanked the president "for his continuous effort to save the Amazon rainforest."<br/>
作为一位曾飞往太空的前美国参议员，纳尔逊还在巴西利亚会见了巴西总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦。会后他告诉记者，他感谢巴西总统“为拯救亚马逊雨林所做的持续努力”。</p>
<p>Nelson said that when he flew aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Columbia in 1986, he witnessed the destruction of the rainforest by the different colors he could see from his spacecraft window.<br/>
纳尔逊说，当他在1986年乘坐美国宇航局的哥伦比亚号航天飞机时，他从飞船窗户看到了不同颜色，亲眼见证了人类对雨林的破坏。</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 July 2023</span><br/>
<p>Late last month, the U.S. Supreme Court <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-supreme-court-rejects-race-consideration-in-college-admissions/7160538.html">ruled</a> that race cannot be the reason for colleges to accept students.</p>
<p>The high court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit such decisions based on race.</p>
<p>The policy that many colleges used to increase the percentage of minorities they admitted was called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-supreme-court-rejects-race-consideration-in-college-admissions/7160538.html">affirmative action</a>. They said the policy helped make their groups of students more <strong>diverse</strong> and improved the ability of minority groups to get higher education.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A student holds a sign that reads in Portuguese To Educate is Freedom during a protest against the budget cuts by President Jair Bolsonaro&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/i&gt;180;s government of public schools and universities, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2022.

(AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)</span></div>
<p>Those opposed to affirmative action said the policy prevented some qualified students from getting into <strong>selective</strong> universities.</p>
<p>Colleges in much of the U.S. were permitted to partly consider a student's race in their admissions decisions for over 50 years.</p>
<p>As a result of the high court's decision in June, most colleges and most universities must now consider <strong>factors</strong> other than race.</p>
<p><strong>Quotas in Brazil</strong></p>
<p>In Brazil, a version of affirmative action has been a part of admissions since 2012. The country has a law that permits both racial and economic <strong>quotas</strong> for its federal or public universities.</p>
<p>Three <a class="wsw__a" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12564">researchers</a> wrote about the effects of affirmative action in Brazil for the <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em>. They <strong>condensed</strong> their findings in a piece for <em>The Conversation, </em>an online publication.</p>
<p>Neil Lewis Jr. of Cornell University in New York state, Inacio Bo of the University of Macau and Rodrigo Zeidan of New York University's Shanghai <strong>campus</strong> worked on the article.</p>
<p>They explained the background of affirmative action in Brazil and the kinds of students the policy affects. They say the policy "has proved to be quite beneficial."</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about quotas</strong></p>
<p>The quotas became law in August 2012. At the time, many people worried that Brazilian students, who were already attending college, would suffer. They argued that professors would have to lower the level of their teaching in order to connect with a larger number of Black and indigenous students from poor areas. They said wealthy students with a good early education would leave for private universities. In some cases, the writers noted, wealthy students did go to other universities.</p>
<p>Others said Black high school students in Brazil would not work as hard because they knew the universities were holding places for them. A study showed that this was true for students who were already achieving. However, the writers said students in a lower group worked harder because they knew they could continue with their studies. Overall, they said, the quotas permitted a larger group of minority students to continue their education.</p>
<p>Only one of Brazil's 81 senators voted against the law. In a story published in 2012, the <em>New York Times</em> quoted Brazil's current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as saying the policy would help some racial groups "make up for lost time." Lula had been president from 2003 to 2010.</p>
<p>The researchers talked about what they considered the difference between Brazil's quota system and the affirmative action policy in the United States.</p>
<p>In Brazil, at least half of the places at federal universities are held for students who are either poor or from racial minority groups. In the U.S., quotas have been unlawful for more than 40 years. But universities could use data about race and wealth to decide the best combination of students.</p>
<p>In Brazil, most students, including those from wealthy families, hope to go to federal universities. The schools are both high-quality and cost-free. One concern about the federal universities, however, is that openings are limited. Some people will not get in and will have to find other schools for higher education.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits in Brazil</strong></p>
<p>The writers said, for those who do attend the federal universities, the last 10 years of quotas have had good results.</p>
<p>The researchers said students admitted because of the quotas performed well. If they lacked learning compared to wealthier students, they learned the necessary skills by graduation.</p>
<p>In addition, some quota students got better grades than the traditional students. The researchers said not all students from wealthy parts of Brazil with good high schools were guaranteed to do well in their university studies.</p>
<p>When the affirmative action plan came out in Brazil, da Silva said it was hard to find Black doctors, dentists and bank supervisors. But Lewis, Zeidan and Bo said the students admitted because of affirmative action were seven percent more likely to have those jobs because of the policy. Many students, they said, would not have moved on to higher education if they did not have places set aside at the universities.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>The writers said the quota system helped diversify students in federal universities. Before 2012, it was difficult for Brazilian universities to make sure poor and minority students could receive higher education. Some universities developed policies to bring in more students from poor areas. However, that did not always make a clear difference in the race of students attending the college.</p>
<p>The writers of the piece worried that a similar plan by American colleges and universities would not work as well as affirmative action. They advised university leaders that race-based polices work better than other systems.</p>
<p>"University leaders," they wrote, "must find...new ways to make their campuses more diverse. How to achieve that may be a <strong>challenge</strong>, but it seems to remain a worthwhile <strong>pursuit</strong>."</p>
<p>In their article, the writers said other nations should be able to enact policies similar to the ones in Brazil without worrying that students will be deeply hurt. The one group they said they are concerned about is the group of wealthier students who lost their places at the federal universities because of quotas. Those students face the high cost of attending private universities.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program, we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples, notes on usage, and sometimes we even use them in short stories.</p>
<p>Today's idiom does not sound nice. In fact, it sounds quite <strong>cruel.</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - National Treasure, right, with jockey John Velazquez, beats Blazing Sevens, with jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., wins the 148th Preakness Stakes horse race at Pimlico Race Course, May 20, 2023, in Maryland.

<p>Today, we talk about <u>beating a dead horse</u>.</p>
<p>Why would anyone do something as pointless as beating a dead animal? Well, that is how we use the expression: to describe something that is a useless thing to do. You are just wasting your time. It is not productive. There is no point.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster's online dictionary says this expression comes from the mid-19th century. Back then, some people may have beaten horses to make them go faster. At the time, this was often thought of as an acceptable practice.</p>
<p>But <u>beating a dead horse</u> would be pointless – because it's dead. No amount of beating will change that fact. We often use this expression in the <strong>negative</strong>. We say things like "I don't want to beat horse ..." or "Not to beat a dead horse..."</p>
<p>Now, if you are a horse lover and don't want to talk about beating one, please do not worry. We have many other expressions and idioms that have a similar meaning.</p>
<p><em>Let's say your friend talks about the same problem. They do not take your advice and they do not seem to want to accept any solution. If you don't want to say to them, "Now you're just beating a dead horse," you can say, "Look, we've <u>gone over the same ground</u> and nothing has changed. So, can we please change the topic?"</em></p>
<p>When you go over the same ground, you talk about the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>There is another expression with the word "ground" that means the same thing as "beat a dead horse." If I have a problem and talk about it too much, I have <u>run it into the ground</u>. Running something into the ground means you have talked about to death. You have talked about it <strong><u>ad nauseam</u></strong>. This means you are making other people sick over it.</p>
<p>So, it is not a good idea <u>to <strong>dwell</strong> <strong>on</strong> an old topic</u>. Hearing about the same thing over and over again is tiring. Many people have lost good friends from <strong><u>belaboring</u></strong><u> a point or an issue.</u></p>
<p>And that is all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>But join us again! We explore so many expressions and idioms in this program. In fact, each week we teach new ones. Not to beat a dead horse, but we really are a great resource for learning English.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

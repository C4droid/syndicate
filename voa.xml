        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Study Finds AI Tools Help but also Hurt Worker Performance  (2023/10/5)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">04 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>An experiment involving hundreds of office workers has found that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can greatly help but also hurt worker performance.</p>
<p>AI tools designed to operate at human levels have greatly expanded in popularity over the past year. These include OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard and Microsoft's AI-powered search engine Bing.</p>
<p>Such tools, also known as chatbots or "generative AI," are computer-powered systems. They are designed to interact smoothly with humans and perform high-level writing and creative work.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The ChatGPT logo and the words Artificial Intelligence are seen in this illustration image taken May 4, 2023. (Reuters)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-8f88-08dbb92a42f0_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The ChatGPT logo and the words Artificial Intelligence are seen in this illustration image taken May 4, 2023. (Reuters)</span></div>
<p>In recent months, these tools have demonstrated an ability to produce high quality work. This has led some technology experts to warn that generative AI systems could end up replacing workers in many industries.</p>
<p>This year, researchers at Harvard Business School and other organizations carried out an experiment. It aimed to test how well AI tools could help workers perform their usual duties, or tasks. It involved more than 700 business advisors, called consultants, from Massachusetts-based Boston Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321">published</a> results from the experiment in a "working paper." The main findings suggest that AI tools like ChatGPT can greatly improve worker performance.</p>
<p>For example, researchers found that, on average, workers who used OpenAI's latest ChatGPT 4 tool completed 12 percent more tasks than non-ChatGPT users. Tasks carried out with help from the AI technology were completed 25 percent faster. And the team found the quality of work performed by consultants using ChatGPT 4 increased about 40 percent.</p>
<p>Work tasks used in the study covered four main areas: creativity, <strong>analytical</strong> thinking, writing and persuasiveness. The team gave examples of worker tasks in each of these areas.</p>
<p>One example for creativity was: "Propose at least 10 ideas for a new shoe targeting an underserved market or sport." For writing, consultants were asked to "write a press release with marketing copy" for a new product. To show persuasiveness, workers were told to write a letter to employees that explained why a particular product would beat competitors.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School's Fabrizio Dell'Acqua was the paper's lead writer. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/enterprise-workers-gain-40-percent-performance-boost-from-gpt-4-harvard-study-finds/">told</a> technology website VentureBeat he thinks the results were especially important because they showed that AI tools can help even highly educated, experienced workers.</p>
<p>"The fact that we could <strong>boost</strong> the performance of these highly paid, highly skilled consultants, from top, <strong>elite</strong> MBA institutions...I would say that's really <strong>impressive</strong>," Dell'Acqua said.</p>
<p>However, the paper also noted areas where the performance of consultants using ChatGPT 4 dropped. The researchers said this was especially true with tasks the AI tool was not good at completing.</p>
<p>Of tasks the AI was good at, the experiment showed it "significantly improved human performance," the paper <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-013_d9b45b68-9e74-42d6-a1c6-c72fb70c7282.pdf">said</a>. But for tasks ChatGPT 4 was not right for, "humans <strong>relied</strong> too much on the AI, and were more likely to make mistakes."</p>
<p>The researchers reported that consultants who used AI for tasks it was not well equipped for "were 19 percent less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI."</p>
<p>The experiment also showed how consultants used the AI tool differently to improve their work. The researchers said some workers purposely divided the tasks with some being completely carried out by the AI tool and others the workers themselves carried out completely. Other workers chose to use AI for all tasks, while "continually interacting with the technology."</p>
<p>The team suggests one of the biggest barriers to companies effectively using AI is not knowing which tasks can be completed best with the technology. Finding this out will require businesses to carry out thoughtful research and training efforts in order to find the right mix of AI and human-level work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Three scientists in the United States won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday. The three won for their discovery of quantum dots, a technology widely used today to make displays for electronic devices and medical imaging.<br/>
美国的三名科学家周三赢得了诺贝尔化学奖。 这三个人的获奖是因为发现了量子点，这是一项当今广泛运用于电子设备和医学成像显示的技术。</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize to Moungi Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louis Brus of Columbia University in New York, and Alexei Ekimov of Nanocrystals Technology.<br/>
瑞典皇家科学院将该奖项授予了麻省理工学院的蒙吉·巴文迪，纽约哥伦比亚大学的路易斯·布鲁斯和美国纳米晶体科技公司的阿列克谢·伊基莫夫。</p>
<p>The academy said the three were honored for their work with particles that "have unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps."<br/>
瑞典皇家科学院说，这三个人受到表彰是因为他们所研究的粒子“具有独特特性，现在它们从电视屏幕和LED灯中散发出了光”。</p>
<p>LED lights are electronic lights used all over the world, which use energy very effectively.<br/>
LED灯是世界各地使用的电子灯，它们非常节能。</p>
<p>Pernilla Wittung Stafshede, a member of the Nobel committee that awarded the prize, said, "We have displays on TVs, in your cellphone, that use quantum dots inside..."<br/>
负责颁发该奖项的一名诺贝尔委员会成员佩尔尼拉·维通·斯塔夫斯戴德说：“电视、手机的显示在其内部利用了量子点...”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are quantum dots?<br/>
什么是量子点？</span></p>
<p>Quantum dots are extremely small particles, called nanoparticles. They are said to be about 1/10,000 the width of a human hair. The dots glow blue, red, green or other colors when exposed to light. The color they give off depends on the size of the particles. Larger dots look red, and smaller dots look blue. The color change is caused by the behavior of electrons in these small spaces.<br/>
量子点是极小的颗粒，称为纳米颗粒。 据说它们大约是人头发粗细的一万分之一。 当它暴露于光线时会发出蓝色、红色、绿色或其他颜色。 它们散发的颜色取决于颗粒的大小。 较大的点看起来是红色的，较小的点看起来是蓝色。 颜色变化是由这些小空间中电子的行为引起的。</p>
<p>Physicists had predicted these color-change properties as early as the 1930s. However, it took 50 years of research and development to control the size of quantum dots correctly.<br/>
物理学家早在上世纪三十年代就预测了这些变色的特性。 但是，正确控制量子点的大小花了50年的研究和开发。</p>
<p>Ekimov and Brus were the early researchers of the technology. Bawendi is credited with developing the production of quantum dots being used today.<br/>
伊基莫夫和布鲁斯是该技术的早期研究人员。巴文迪被认为开发了当今正在使用的量子点的生产。</p>
<p>Bawendi used the words, "very surprised, sleepy, shocked, unexpected and very honored," to describe his feelings. Bawendi added he was not thinking about the possible uses of his work when he started researching quantum dots.<br/>
巴文迪使用了“非常惊讶，瞌睡，震惊，出乎意料和非常荣幸”等词语来描述他的感受。 巴文迪补充说，当他开始研究量子点时，他并没有考虑这项工作的可能用途。</p>
<p>"The motivation really is the basic science. A basic understanding, the curiosity of how does the world work? And that's what drives scientists and academic scientists to do what they do," he said.<br/>
他说：“我的动机确实是基础科学。基本理解就是对世界如何运作的好奇心？这就是促使科学家和学术科学家做他们所做事情的原因。”</p>
<p>Brus of Columbia University said he did not answer the phone call from the Swedish academy. He finally saw the news online when he got up in the morning.<br/>
哥伦比亚大学的布鲁斯说，他没有接到瑞典学院的电话。 早上起床时，他最终是在网上看到这一消息。</p>
<p>Brus said the practical uses of quantum dots, like creating the colors in TV screens, are something he was hoping for when he started the work many years ago.<br/>
布鲁斯说，量子点的实际用途，例如在电视屏幕上创建颜色，这是他多年前开始这项工作时所希望的。</p>
<p>"Basic research is extremely hard to predict exactly how it's going to work out," Brus said. "It's more for the knowledge base than it is for the actual materials. But in this case, it's both."<br/>
布鲁斯说：“基础研究很难准确地预测它将产生什么效果。它更多是用于知识基础，而不是用于实际材料。但是在这个案例中，这两者兼而有之。”</p>
<p>Ekimov is the former chief scientist at Nanocrystals Technology, a company based in New York where he started working in 1999. The Swedish academy credited him with showing how the size of nanoparticles affected the colors in glass.<br/>
伊基莫夫是美国纳米晶体科技公司的前任首席科学家，他于1999年开始为这家总部位于纽约的公司工作。瑞典皇家科学院认为他证明了纳米颗粒的大小如何影响玻璃中的颜色。</p>
<p>The three will receive 11 million Swedish crowns, about $1 million, and a gold medal when they collect their Nobel Prizes at the award ceremonies in December.<br/>
这三个人将在12月的颁奖典礼上领取诺贝尔奖时获得1100万瑞典克朗（约合100万美元）和一枚金牌。</p>

<p>In a small building in Peshawar, Pakistan, a group of Afghan women watch a teacher show them how to use a <strong>sewing</strong> machine.</p>
<p>The training program was established last year by Mahra Basheer who saw an increasing number of women coming from neighboring Afghanistan. Since the Taliban took over in 2021, women in Afghanistan have faced growing restrictions and an economic crisis.</p>
<p>Basheer created the program to provide choices for women to support themselves. She teaches sewing, <strong>digital</strong> skills and beauty treatments. And Basheer quickly found hundreds of women wanting to join the program.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Afghan women attend tailoring class at the Skills Academy for Needy Aspirants (SANA) in Peshawar, Pakistan July 13, 2023.

<p>"If we get assistance, I think we will be able to train between 250 and 500 students at one time, <strong>empowering</strong> women who can play an important <strong>role</strong> in the community," Basheer said.</p>
<p>Officials say hundreds of thousands of Afghans have traveled to Pakistan since the Taliban took over in 2021. Even before then, 1.5 million registered refugees were in the country. This is one of the largest such populations in the world, the United Nations refugee agency says.</p>
<p>More than a million others are estimated to live there unregistered.</p>
<p>Struggling with an economic crisis of its own, Pakistan's government is increasingly worried about the number of Afghan refugees. Many Afghans have been arrested in recent months. Lawyers and officials say they do not have the correct legal documents to live in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Basheer said that her main aim was expanding operations for Afghan women. But she has also included some Pakistani women in the program to increase their choices in the conservative area.</p>
<p>The training program lasts three months. When they complete the program, the women direct their attention to earning enough money to survive. Many women begin their own businesses.</p>
<p>Fatima, a nineteen-year-old from Afghanistan, completed the training program. She said she wants to open a beauty <strong>salon</strong> in Peshawar. It is currently banned in her home country just a few hours away.</p>
<p>"Right now my plan is to start a salon at home. Then to work very professionally so that I can <strong>eventually</strong> open a very big salon for myself," she said.</p>

<p>Many students across the United States fell behind in math during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many educators are seeking ways to bring students back up to usual math levels.</p>
<p>Such efforts paid off for a rural school system in the southern state of Alabama. It has shown major improvement.</p>
<p>A study called the Nation's Report Card shows that Alabama students led the nation in <strong>maintaining</strong> math learning during the pandemic. And the state's Piedmont City school system landed at the top in a comparison of scores from before and during the pandemic. Nationwide, students on average fell half a year behind in math, researchers say.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Piedmont math teacher Cassie Holbrooks helps a small group of fourth-grade students with a math problem in Piedmont, Ala., on Aug. 31, 2023. (Trisha Powell Crain/AL.com via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-d385-08dbba99dfc5_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Piedmont math teacher Cassie Holbrooks helps a small group of fourth-grade students with a math problem in Piedmont, Ala., on Aug. 31, 2023. (Trisha Powell Crain/AL.com via AP)</span></div>
<p>The Piedmont school system has about 1,100 students. Seven out of 10 children receive reduced-cost or free meals in the schools.</p>
<p>The school system has stuck with a policy it established before the pandemic: Teachers use test scores to learn where students are struggling and then target teaching to each child.</p>
<p>"We made a total <strong>transformation</strong> about five years ago," said Mike Hayes, the school system's chief. "We decided that we were going to let data make every decision."</p>
<p>Targeted <strong>instruction</strong> for small groups of students has years of research and evidence to back it up, said Rebecca Dreyfus of the educational nonprofit TNTP.</p>
<p>"The short answer is that using data effectively and efficiently to plan and <strong>monitor</strong> instruction is always going to make instruction better for kids," Dreyfus said.</p>
<p>Piedmont students were 35th in math skills for the state in 2017, when Hayes became the school system's leader. By spring 2022, Piedmont's students had moved to the 12th position.</p>
<p>"Once we made that decision and stuck to it and made changes and <strong>allowed</strong> our teachers time to look at the data and dive into the data, it paid off," Hayes said.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers go deep into data</strong></p>
<p>As part of the effort, the Piedmont school system made the school day longer. This permitted time every four weeks for "data days," when educators get together to study the numbers.</p>
<p>Cassie Holbrooks teaches fourth-grade math. She said the "data days" help teachers see where the weaknesses are and target instruction.</p>
<p>Sixth-grade teacher Lisa Hayes joined the school system five years ago. She said she was surprised to see how hard teachers worked during the data days.</p>
<p>"When I came here and we had a workday," she said, "you don't sit in your room. You're in here (the media center) most of the day, digging through test scores."</p>
<p>Teachers then use the information to decide how to divide the students into small groups for targeted instruction.</p>
<p>Grouping two to six students together to work on a specific skill has long been used for reading instruction and in younger grades. There is less research on the use of targeted small group instruction in math. But researchers like Dreyfus say it involves the same idea of identifying students who need extra help, rather than simply pulling out children who are "behind."</p>
<p><strong>Small groups and independent work</strong></p>
<p>While math teachers in Piedmont schools work with small groups, other students write in their math books, play learning games, or work on individual learning plans.</p>
<p>At first, when Piedmont expanded small group instruction in math, teachers said they did not have enough time to do the work well, Hayes said. So the schools expanded math and English language study time to between 80 and 120 minutes each day.</p>
<p>The longer math classes made a big difference, teacher Landon Pruitt said. "In a 52- or 53-minute class," he said, "there's no way you can <strong>consistently</strong> do (small groups) and work on getting through the <strong>standards</strong> that you have to cover."</p>
<p>The schools also had to help teachers <strong>adjust</strong> classroom management techniques as small groups and independent work would be done at the same time. Hayes said one solution was to give teachers a program to monitor each students' screen. The district wants to make sure teachers have the support and resources to do the job well, he added.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure we have a secret sauce or anything..." Hayes said. But, he noted that the teachers believe in learning data, and letting that data direct instruction.</p>

<p>Three European physics professors won the Nobel Prize on Tuesday for their work on a system that permits scientists to study electrons.</p>
<p>Electrons are one of the three particles that make up atoms.</p>
<p>They are so small, however, and move so fast, that scientists had never been able to observe them.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This combo of pictures taken Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2023, shows from left, French scientist Pierre Agostini, Scientist Ferenc Krausz, and French-Swedish physicist Anne L'Huillier.

<p>However, the work of French-Swedish physicist Anne L'Huillier, French physicist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born physicist Ferenc Krausz solved that problem.</p>
<p>The professors carried out research that showed how <strong>ultra</strong>-fast light could permit scientists to "see" an electron for the first time.</p>
<p>"You can see whether it's on one side of a molecule or on the other," L'Huillier, 65, said. "It's still very <strong>blurry</strong>."</p>
<p>The system that came from their work creates light that shows the fast-moving electron in its orbit around the nucleus.</p>
<p>Krausz's team first created the short light pulses in the early 2000s. He said the system is similar to a camera with a fast <strong>shutter</strong> speed that permits a photographer to capture a Formula One race car as it crosses the finish line.</p>
<p>Using a special camera with light to see a clear image of a hummingbird's fast wing movements is another example.</p>
<p>But the speed of an electron is so fast that it could not be captured before the scientists produced experiments that showed it was possible to create a <strong>flash</strong> of light in one quintillionth of a second.</p>
<p>Mats Larsson of the Nobel Committee said the electrons are the "workforce" of the atom. "Once you can control and understand electrons, you have taken a very big step forward."</p>
<p>The method to study electrons should help scientists develop better electronic devices or study molecules for medical purposes.</p>
<p>L'Huillier is the fifth woman to receive the physics Nobel. She said her work is important because electrons are "how the atoms <strong>bind</strong> together," and where the chemical reactions happen.</p>
<p>She said she spent 30 years working on the project, and she wants other scientists to keep working on "<strong>fundamental</strong> science" no matter how it might be used in the future. It did not become clear how her work would be used in "the real world" until many years passed.</p>
<p>L'Huillier was in the middle of teaching a class at Lund University in Sweden when she got the news. "It's incredible," she said. She went back to teaching the class after being told of the prize.</p>
<p>Agostini is a retired professor at The Ohio State University. Krausz is a professor at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.</p>
<p>"I did not expect it," Krausz said. "I am <strong>overwhelmed</strong>," he added, asking if he was "in reality or it's just a long dream."</p>
<p>Agostini was in Paris when the news was announced but did not get a call from the Nobel Committee. He suggested the Nobel group was looking for him Columbus, Ohio, where Ohio State is located.</p>
<p>The 82-year-old said the prize was "good, but a bit late for me."</p>
<p>L'Huillier experimented with how a laser affects atoms in a gas causing electrons to produce light. Krausz worked on creating a system that could detect a single, very fast light <strong>pulse</strong>. Agostini was able to investigate a series of very fast pulses.</p>
<p>All the experiments showed that it would be possible one day to observe an image captured in an extremely small <strong>fraction</strong> of a second, known as an attosecond.</p>
<p>Physics is the second Nobel Prize of the week. Two scientists earned the medicine prize on Monday for their work on mRNA that led to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Chemistry, literature, peace and economics come next.</p>

            <title>Pope Opens Gathering to Discuss Future of Catholic Church  (2023/10/4)</title>

<p>Pope Francis on Wednesday is opening a gathering of bishops and others to discuss the future of the Roman Catholic Church. Some of the discussions include subjects that have never been considered before.</p>
<p>For the first time, women and non-clergy can vote alongside bishops in what is called a Synod of Bishops. The change reflects Francis' belief that the Church is more about its people than its leaders.</p>
<p>The gathering, called a synod, starts on October 4 and will end on the 29. It will be followed by a second gathering next year. The second synod is expected to put forward detailed proposals for Francis to consider in a future document.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pope Francis attends the prayer vigil in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, September 30, 2023. (REUTERS/Remo Casilli)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9a99-08dbc28505bd_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pope Francis attends the prayer vigil in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, September 30, 2023. (REUTERS/Remo Casilli)</span></div>
<p>The synod will have 365 voting members including the pope and 54 women. Their numbers are chosen by national bishops' organizations and religious orders.</p>
<p>In addition, there are around 100 experts and "<strong>facilitators</strong>," who will help move the discussion along. But they will not vote on a final document.</p>
<p><strong>What will be discussed?</strong></p>
<p>The working document for the gathering came after two years of listening to concerns from Catholics around the world. The aim has been to raise questions and start a debate.</p>
<p>For example, the document calls for specific steps to <strong>promote </strong>women to decision-making positions in the church. And it calls for church members to have more influence in church governance.</p>
<p>It also suggests the "inclusion" of LGBTQ+ Catholics and measures to prevent clergy from abusing their power.</p>
<p><strong>Conservative concerns</strong></p>
<p>Some conservatives have raised questions about the synod since Francis announced it three years ago. They said that those questions have already been settled by church teachings. And raising the questions only risks division among church members.</p>
<p>Just this week, five conservative cardinals from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas made their disagreement with Pope Francis public.</p>
<p>In a letter, they put forward five questions, or "dubia," asking Francis to <strong>affirm</strong> church teaching on these issues, including homosexuality and female clergy. They said the synod was creating <strong>confusion</strong>.</p>
<p>Francis answered that changes in the world help the church to better understand and explain its teachings and that the synod is a way to find the path forward.</p>
<p>"With much sincerity, I tell you it's not good to be afraid of these questions," Francis told them.</p>
<p><strong>A closed synod</strong></p>
<p>For two years, the preparation for the synod has been open to the public. However, the synod itself will be closed to outsiders.</p>
<p>There will be no live stream of the gathering. Organizers say it will be a closed-door meeting and those taking part have been told not to speak to reporters. No daily briefings are planned as in earlier synods although five briefings are expected to take place over the time of the gathering.</p>
<p>Francis has defended the measures. The pope said he did not want "political <strong>gossip</strong>" leaking out with news of attendees arguing over disputed issues.</p>
<p>"This isn't a television show," he told reporters in August.</p>

            <title>Export Restrictions Causing Food Prices to Rise  (2023/10/4)</title>

<p>Important foods like grains and cooking oil again are growing more costly in many places around the world.</p>
<p>Observers say that is because countries have put export restrictions in place to protect food supplies at home. They also blame the price rise on weather conditions and the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>Caroline Kyalo is a 28-year-old who works at a hair <strong>salon</strong> in Kenya's capital Nairobi. She experienced the rising cost of food while planning meals for her two children. The price of onions has risen by 200 percent since neighboring Tanzania restricted agricultural exports. Kyalo tried a different kind of onion but those became too costly as well. Cooking oil and corn flour prices are increasing also.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="People buy onions at an open market in Nairobi, Kenya Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-0086-08dbc070dd3f_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">People buy onions at an open market in Nairobi, Kenya Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023.

<p>So, she said, "I just decided to be cooking once a day."</p>
<p>East Africa has fertile land and a large workforce. But the high cost of growing and transporting crops and a lack of rain have resulted in decreased local production. In the case of onions, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization found that, in 2014, Kenya was getting half of its onions from Tanzania. Some traders have tried to get supplies from Ethiopia. Others have stopped selling onions altogether.</p>
<p>But Timothy Kinyua, who says prices have reached their highest level in seven years, promised he would sell the crop.</p>
<p>"It's something we can't cook without," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Spreading food restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Glauber is with the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. He said Tanzania's onion limits this year are one example of the spread of food restrictions. He called it a "contagion," or something that spreads like an infectious disease. His organization says that 19 countries have put 41 food export restrictions in place. The restrictions include bans or taxes.</p>
<p>India banned the export of some rice earlier this year cutting one fifth of the world's export market. Myanmar answered with its own export bans. India has also restricted onion exports. The action sent prices climbing in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Dry weather in Spain has hurt its olive crop causing European buyers to look to Turkey. But rising prices there led to export limits.</p>
<p>Morocco, which suffered a deadly earthquake recently, has also stopped exports of crops including onions, potatoes and tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>‘The new normal'</strong></p>
<p>Over a period of years, food prices change sharply. In 2007 and 2008, rice and wheat prices doubled. Glauber, who also is a former economist from the Department of Agriculture, said changes are likely to continue.</p>
<p>"I think increased <strong>volatility</strong> is certainly the new normal," he said.</p>
<p>For example, both Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of wheat, barely, sunflower oil and several other foods important to developing nations. The conflict between them interferes with production by both.</p>
<p>Changes in weather are also affecting agriculture, observers say. El Ni<i></i>241;o is a periodic warm current in the southern Pacific Ocean. It is linked to changes in weather in several places around the world. Some scientists say climate change could make the El Ni<i></i>241;o current more severe affecting weather everywhere.</p>
<p>For example, a lack of rain in India means export restrictions there might not end with the new rice harvest in October.</p>
<p><strong>Importers face added risk</strong></p>
<p>Most at risk from weather changes are nations that depend heavily on imported food. The World Banks, for example, notes that the Philippines imports 14 percent of its food. However, recent storms could mean further crop deficits. Rice prices there increased 8.7 percent in August. That is double the increase from the month before.</p>
<p>Since prices increased, Philippine food store owners say they are losing money. Thirty-two-year-old Charina Em owns a store in the Trabajo market in Manila.</p>
<p>"We cannot save money anymore. It is like we just work so that we can have food daily," she said.</p>
<p>Cynthia Esguerra is 66 years old and has several diseases. She said she has had to choose between medicines and food.</p>
<p>"I just don't worry about my sickness. I leave it up to God. I don't buy medicines anymore, I just put it there to buy food, or loans," she said.</p>

<p>United States health advisers voted against an experimental treatment for ALS disease last week. The vote came after years of efforts by ALS patients and their families in support of the unproven medical treatment.</p>
<p>ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als">Patients with ALS</a> slowly lose the ability to control muscle movements, the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe. The U.S. National Institutes of Health says people can get the disease at any age. It most commonly develops between the ages of 55 and 75.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, a group of health advisors for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 17 to one against the treatment from BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics. The Israel-based company's treatment, NurOwn, uses stem cells. These are cells that can develop into many kinds of body cells. The group found the treatment was not effective for patients with ALS. A member of the group representing ALS patients was the only vote in favor. One expert did not register a vote.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration building is seen behind FDA logos at a bus stop on the agency's campus in Silver Spring, Md., on Aug. 2, 2018.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)</span></div>
<p>Lisa Lee, a health expert from Virginia Tech University voted against the treatment. She said, "Creating false hope can be considered a moral injury and the use of <strong>statistical</strong> magic or <strong>manipulation</strong> to provide false hope is problematic."</p>
<p>The FDA is not required to accept the group's vote. However, the agency's own scientists said earlier in the week that BrainStorm's treatment was "scientifically incomplete."</p>
<p>Brainstorm and the ALS community wanted to use the meeting to change the FDA's thinking about the NurOwn treatment.</p>
<p>Brainstorm's 200-patient study failed to show that NurOwn extended life, slowed the disease, or improved patients' ability to move. But the FDA agreed to bring outside advisers together after ALS patients and supporters submitted 30,000 signatures seeking a public meeting.</p>
<p>In the last year, the FDA has approved two new experimental drugs for ALS, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-treatment-option-patients-als">Relyvrio</a> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-associated-mutation-sod1-gene">Qalsody</a>. The approvals followed intense campaigns from the ALS community although there have been a limited number of scientific studies of the treatments.</p>
<p>The FDA has used the term "regulatory flexibility" when considering experimental treatments for some conditions, including ALS and Alzheimer's. But the agency appears unwilling to overlook the results of BrainStorm's approval effort. Important information about manufacturing and quality control was missing.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck of the National Institutes of Health said, "It really is a disease that needs a safe and effective treatment and there are a lot of other <strong>prospects</strong> out there that we need to <strong>encourage</strong>. Approving one like this would get in the way of that."</p>
<p>At last week's meeting, ALS patients, their family members and doctors spoke in support of BrainStorm's treatment. Several presented before-and-after videos that showed patients who had taken part in BrainStorm's study. The videos showed the patients walking, climbing stairs and doing other activities.</p>
<p>Mitze Klingenberg spoke for her son Matt Klingenberg who doctors found to have ALS in 2018. She said, "When Matt is on NurOwn it helps him, when he's off of it he gets worse."</p>
<p>The FDA is expected to issue its decision on the treatment by December 8.</p>

<p>Two scientists have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for making molecule discoveries that helped create COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>The Nobel Assembly at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute announced the winners Monday. They are Hungarian-American Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman.</p>
<p>Members of the assembly praised the two scientists for assisting in “the <strong>unprecedented</strong> rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times."</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this undated image provided by Penn Medicine, Katalin Karik&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/i&gt;243; and Drew Weissman pose for a photo at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

<p>Kariko and Weissman have long cooperated on research while working as professors at the University of Pennsylvania. The two centered on a technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA.</p>
<p>Technology companies such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna used mRNA to create their COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccines were deployed around the world to fight the disease.</p>
<p>The Nobel organization said the two scientists had changed "our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our <strong>immune system</strong>.”</p>
<p>Vaccine makers usually add elements of an inactive or weakened virus to the shot mixture. But with mRNA vaccines, scientists instead create a genetic material to direct the human body to produce <strong>antibodies</strong> and recognize and destroy the virus.</p>
<p>Research on mRNA has gone on for about 30 years. But no mRNA vaccine was developed and approved for use on people until the COVID-19 pandemic. In early experiments, researchers discovered that injecting laboratory-grown mRNA into animals usually led to a body reaction that destroyed it.</p>
<p>But Kariko and Weissman found a way to make a small change, or modification, to the building blocks of RNA that permitted it to survive immune defenses in the body. Their discovery was seen as breaking a major barrier because it showed that mRNA technology could be used as a treatment in humans.</p>
<p>The 68-year-old Kariko is the 13th woman to win the Nobel Prize in medicine. She was a vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to make one of the COVID-19 vaccines. She and the 64-year-old Weissman met by chance in the 1990s at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Kariko noted that her husband was first to pick up the early morning call about the news. She said she then watched the announcement to make sure it was true. "I was very much surprised. But I am very happy.”</p>
<p>In reaction to his prize, Weissman said, “The future is just so incredible. We’ve been thinking for years about everything that we could do with RNA, and now it’s here.”</p>
<p>The two researchers have cooperated for many years, with Kariko centering on RNA and Weissman studying related immunology. “We educated each other,” Kariko said.</p>
<p>The prize comes with an award of $1 million. An award ceremony for all the Nobel awards, except the Peace Prize, is set for December 10 in Stockholm. The Peace Prize ceremony will take place in Norway’s capital, Oslo.</p>
<p>Other Nobel announcements will be made this week. The prize in physics will be announced Tuesday. Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, while literature will be awarded on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced Friday.</p>

<p>Mamadou Safaiou Barry lives in the West African nation of Guinea. He wanted to study Islamic <strong>theology</strong> at a top school in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>Without money to pay for transport, Barry drew a map of Africa and headed out on a used <strong>bicycle </strong>for the trip across the continent.</p>
<p>Carrying only a change of clothes, a flashlight, and a small tool, the 25-year-old rode through jungles, deserts, and conflict areas in the hope of getting accepted to the school and finding a way to pay for it.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mamadou Safaiou Barry, a 25-year-old from Guinea, walks to the center where he studies Islam and the Koran, in El Marg district, east of Cairo, Egypt, September 23, 2023.

<p>Four months and seven countries later, he is in Cairo with a full <strong>scholarship</strong> to Al-Azhar University. That is one of the world's oldest and most respected Sunni Muslim learning centers.</p>
<p>"If you have a dream, stay with it and be strong," Barry said. "God will help you."</p>
<p>Thousands of West Africans like Barry take risky journeys across the Sahara desert each year, searching for a better life. But many never make it. Nearly 500 people died or disappeared on West African migration routes last year, data from the International Organization for Migration shows.</p>
<p>Barry decided the risk was worth the <strong>reward</strong>.</p>
<p>"I had to fight," Barry said last August in Chad.</p>
<p>Barry rode about 100 kilometers each day. He rode through Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, and Niger. He had to stop in N'Djamena, the Chadian capital because of the ongoing conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p>He said he had already been detained three times - twice in Burkina Faso and once in Togo. There, security forces held him for nine days without charge before releasing him for $56.</p>
<p>That was all of his money for the rest of the trip, he said.</p>
<p>"I often slept in the <strong>bush</strong> because I was afraid of people in the cities," Barry said. "I thought they would take my bike and hurt me."</p>
<p>Barry's luck changed again in Chad. There, a local <strong>philanthropist</strong>, who had read about his trip online, offered to fly him directly to Egypt and avoid the fighting in Sudan.</p>
<p>Barry arrived in Cairo on September 5 and days later received a full scholarship to Al-Azhar.</p>
<p>He intends to return to Guinea when his studies are complete, to spread the <strong>faith</strong> that has taken him so far.</p>
<p>"When I return to my country, I would like to be someone who teaches Islam and tells people how to do good things," he said.</p>

            <title>Southeast Asian Countries Consider Sharing Energy, Power  (2023/10/3)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Southeast Asian nations are increasingly looking to share power as a result of concerns about climate change.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Indonesia signed a deal in Bali, Indonesia in August to study 18 possible areas where cross-border power lines can be set up.</p>
<p>Those links could eventually create power equal to what 33 nuclear power plants would produce in a year. The links are economically and technically possible, and now are supported by <strong>regional</strong> governments, said Beni Suryadi a power expert at the ASEAN Center for Energy in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Johor-Singapore Causeway lies empty in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, on Nov. 28, 2021.

<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN is a political and economic group of 10 countries across a large area. The group includes small countries such as Brunei and Singapore as well as larger ones such as Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Cross-border power purchases accounted for just 2.7 percent of the region's<strong> capacity</strong> in 2017, says the Global Interconnection Journal. But those were between two countries, such as Thailand and Laos.</p>
<p>Now, more countries are looking at power sharing as a way to move their economies away from coal and other<strong> fossil fuels</strong>. Vietnam would like a regional<strong> grid</strong> so it could sell clean energy from offshore wind to its neighbors. And the Malaysian area of Sarawak is looking to sell its <strong>hydropower</strong> to neighboring Indonesia.</p>
<p>The plan for a regional grid between the 10 ASEAN members was developed twenty years ago, but progress has been slowed by problems including technical barriers and political mistrust.</p>
<p>The region now recognizes it must move faster. Climate change could reduce the region's economic growth by more than a third by the middle of the century, a report presented at the 2021 U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland says.</p>
<p>Demand for electricity is rising, and governments have realized the move away from fossil fuels requires an interconnected grid, Suryadi observed. "It has become a<strong> crucial</strong> need for every country," he said.</p>
<p>In the past, countries in the region paid more attention to energy security. They used fossil fuels and often built more capacity than they needed.</p>
<p>But renewable energy costs are falling, making hydroelectric, solar and wind power more affordable. All ASEAN countries apart from the Philippines have promised to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere by 2050.</p>
<p>So, arguments in favor of an interconnected grid appear to be winning.</p>
<p>But issues remain.</p>
<p>One of ASEAN's central policies is non-<strong>interference</strong>, which means members are less likely to do joint projects. Energy needs within a country sometimes conflict with the interests of an interconnected grid.</p>
<p>Nadhilah Shani, another expert at the ASEAN Center for Energy, said that this creates a difficult position for some countries. The countries could sell clean energy to neighbors for the region to move away from fossil fuels, or they could use those resources to meet their own climate targets.</p>
<p>The region's lack of a legal agreement for such things as setting submarine power cables is another difficult issue.</p>
<p>Not all the technical problems have been solved. <strong>Voltages</strong> used by each country can differ, as do the capacities of their grids. Even countries whose grids cross borders, like Thailand, need to upgrade them, said Harald Link, president of Thailand's Association of Private Power Producers.</p>
<p>"You need a huge amount of electricity— and they want it green. And where do you get it from? For some countries, it is more difficult to make it green," Link said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The American space agency NASA has a new plan for deorbiting the International Space Station (ISS). The plan involves developing a new spacecraft to safely guide the ISS during its final reentry through Earth's atmosphere.<br/>
美国宇航局制定了一项新的国际空间站脱轨计划。该计划包括开发一种新的航天器，安全引导国际空间站最后一次重返地球大气层。</p>
<p>NASA cooperates with four other space agencies on the station. These include the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency and Russia's Roscosmos.<br/>
美国宇航局在空间站上与其他四个航天机构合作。其中包括加拿大航天局、欧洲航天局、日本宇宙航空研究开发机构和俄罗斯航天局。</p>
<p>The ISS began serving as a space research center more than 22 years ago. It has been widely praised as a scientific success. But, NASA and its international partners say the ISS has a limited technical lifetime. NASA has said it will keep operating and sending astronauts to the ISS until 2030.<br/>
国际空间站于22年前开始作为一个空间研究中心。它被广泛赞誉为科学上的成功。但是，美国宇航局及其国际合作伙伴表示，国际空间站的技术寿命有限。美国宇航局表示，将继续运营国际空间站并派遣宇航员，直到2030年。</p>
<p>After that, the U.S. space agency plans to use privately developed space laboratories for its space research needs. NASA says this will permit it to pay space station operators only for the goods and services it needs.<br/>
之后，美国航天局计划使用私人开发的太空实验室来满足其太空研究需求。美国宇航局表示，这将允许其仅为其所需的商品和服务向空间站运营商支付费用。</p>
<p>NASA has already chosen several American companies to develop future space stations. These privately-operated stations will aim to serve the science needs of NASA, as well as other nations' space agencies and other organizations.<br/>
美国宇航局已经选择了几家美国公司来开发未来的空间站。这些私人运营的空间站将致力于满足美国宇航局、其他国家的航天机构和其他组织的科学需求。</p>
<p>In a report to the U.S. Congress last year, NASA established its plans for the ISS. The report said the agency aims to make the station's final years its most productive. Among the goals NASA declared: "To support deep space exploration and continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity."<br/>
在去年提交给美国国会的一份报告中，美国宇航局制定了国际空间站的计划。该报告称，该机构的目标是使空间站的最后几年成为最富有成效的几年。美国宇航局宣布的目标之一是：“支持深空探索，继续为人类带来医疗和环境效益。”</p>
<p>The agency recently announced its new deorbiting plan for the ISS after considering other options to retire it. A past plan, or option, involved the use of several Russian spacecraft. But NASA officials rejected that plan and decided a new, specially designed spacecraft would better serve the needs of the deorbiting operation.<br/>
在考虑了退役国际空间站的其他选择后，该机构最近宣布了其新的国际空间站脱轨计划。过去的计划或选择涉及使用几艘俄罗斯航天器。但美国宇航局官员拒绝了这一计划，并决定建造一艘新的、专门设计的航天器来更好地满足脱轨操作的需要。</p>
<p>Other options included a plan to take apart the space station in space and transport its pieces back to Earth. Another plan would have seen the ISS sent to a higher orbit, where it would remain out-of-service. A third option involved a non-controlled reentry operation. NASA said none of these met its requirements for safety and effectiveness.<br/>
其他选择包括在太空中拆除空间站并将其部件运回地球的计划。另一个计划是将国际空间站送往更高的轨道，在那里它将停止服务。第三种选择涉及非受控再入操作。美国宇航局表示，这些都不符合其安全性和有效性的要求。</p>
<p>The agency recently released a request for proposals to companies interested in building the new the spacecraft. NASA calls it the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle (USDV). It says it can be a completely new vehicle or an existing design that is changed to meet all needs of the deorbiting process. The agency said it is seeking proposals now because the effort "will take years to develop, test, and certify."<br/>
该机构最近向有兴趣建造这种新航天器的公司发布了一份征求建议书的请求。美国宇航局称之为美国脱轨飞行器。美国宇航局称它可以是一种全新的载运工具，也可以是一种现有的设计，可以进行改造以满足脱轨过程的所有需求。该机构表示，目前正在寻求提案，因为这项工作“需要数年的时间来开发、测试和认证”。</p>
<p>NASA has said when it is time to retire the ISS, it will begin taking the first steps to slowly lower its operating altitude. This part of the process can likely be carried out by the ISS and its systems, without the need for additional spacecraft.<br/>
美国宇航局表示，当国际空间站退役时，它将开始采取第一步，慢慢降低其运行高度。这部分过程可能由国际空间站及其系统进行，而不需要额外的航天器。</p>
<p>But the final part of the operation, reentry, will center on guiding the ISS though Earth's atmosphere to a pre-chosen target in an unpopulated area in the ocean. NASA says this final part "is expected to require a new or modified spacecraft using a large amount of propellant."<br/>
但行动的最后一部分，即重返大气层，将聚焦于引导国际空间站穿过地球大气层，到达海洋中无人区的预定目标。美国宇航局表示，这最后一部分操作“预计需要一种使用大量推进剂的全新或改进的航天器”。</p>
<p>The targeted landing spot has been identified as a place called Point Nemo in the South Pacific Ocean. This is a stretch of open water between New Zealand and the southernmost part of South America. The U.S. National Ocean Service identifies Point Nemo as the point in the ocean that is farthest from land.<br/>
目标着陆点已被确认为南太平洋的一处名为尼莫角的地方。这是新西兰和南美洲最南端之间的一片开阔水域。美国国家海洋局将尼莫角确定为海洋中距离陆地最远的点。</p>
<p>NASA predicts that most ISS equipment will burn up or vaporize during the intense heating that happens during atmospheric re-entry. But it says some denser or more heat-resistant elements are expected to survive and land in the targeted ocean area.<br/>
美国宇航局预测，国际空间站的大多数设备在重返大气层期间发生的剧烈加热过程中将会烧尽或汽化。但它表示，一些密度更大或更耐热的元素有望残存下来，并落入目标海域。</p>

<p>Neanderthals live on within us.</p>
<p>These ancient human relatives, and others, called Denisovans, once lived alongside our early Homo sapiens ancestors. The groups mixed and had children. As a result, some of the Neanderthals and Denisovans live on in our genes. And science is starting to show just how much that shapes us.</p>
<p>Mary Prendergast, a Rice University archeologist, said, "We're now carrying the genetic <strong>legacies</strong> and learning about what that means for our bodies and our health."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A boy pats the head of a sculpture of a Neanderthal boy, inside the Smithsonian Hall of Human Origins, Thursday, July 20, 2023, at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2df9fea7-8037-4bd0-904c-1f9ae55e717b_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A boy pats the head of a sculpture of a Neanderthal boy, inside the Smithsonian Hall of Human Origins, Thursday, July 20, 2023, at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</span></div>
<p>In the past few months, researchers have linked Neanderthal DNA to a serious hand disease, the shape of people's noses and other human<strong> traits</strong>. They even placed a gene carried by Neanderthals and Denisovans into mice to investigate its effects on biology. The researchers found that the gene gave the mice larger heads and an extra rib.</p>
<p>Much of the human story remains a mystery. But Dr. Hugo Zeberg of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden said new technologies and research are helping scientists begin to answer the questions: "Who are we? Where did we come from?"</p>
<p>And the answers point to a deep reality: We have far more in common with our ancient cousins than we ever thought.</p>
<p><strong>Neanderthal, Denisovan DNA </strong></p>
<p>Until recently, the genetic legacy from ancient humans was invisible. But there has been a number of discoveries from ancient DNA, an area of study developed by Nobel Prize winner Svante Paabo. He was first in creating a Neanderthal <strong>genome</strong>.</p>
<p>Research shows some African populations have almost no Neanderthal DNA, while those from European or Asian backgrounds have up to two percent. Denisovan DNA is rarely found in most parts of the world but makes up four to six percent of the DNA of people in Melanesia. The Pacific Ocean area extends from New Guinea to the Fiji Islands.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much, but it adds up: Even though only 100,000 Neanderthals ever lived, "half of the Neanderthal genome is still around, in small pieces <strong>scattered</strong> around modern humans," said Zeberg, who works closely with Paabo.</p>
<p>It is also enough to affect us in very real ways. Scientists studying the subject say the DNA can be both helpful and harmful.</p>
<p>For example, Neanderthal DNA has been linked to autoimmune diseases like Graves' disease and rheumatoid arthritis. When Homo sapiens came out of Africa, they had no immunity to diseases in Europe and Asia. But, Neanderthals and Denisovans already living there did.</p>
<p>Chris Stringer is a human evolution researcher at the Natural History Museum in London. Stringer said that by mating with Neanderthals and Denisovans, Homo sapiens "got a quick fix to our immune systems, which was good news 50,000 years ago." Stringer added, "The result today is, for some people, that our immune systems are oversensitive, and sometimes they turn on themselves."</p>
<p>In 2020, research by Zeberg and Paabo found that a major genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19 came from Neanderthals. "We compared it to the Neanderthal genome and it was a perfect match," Zeberg said.</p>
<p>The next year, they found a set of DNA <strong>variants</strong> along a single chromosome inherited from Neanderthals had the opposite effect: protecting people from severe COVID.</p>
<p>Much less is known about our genetic legacy from Denisovans – although some research has linked genes from them to fat processing and better performance at high altitudes. Maanasa Raghavan, a human genetics expert at the University of Chicago, said Tibetans carry an amount of Denisovan DNA. She noted that the population continues to live and do well in low-oxygen environments today.</p>
<p><strong>Human evolution </strong></p>
<p>John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison said that human evolution was not about "survival of the fittest and extinction." Instead, he suggested, it is about "interaction and mixture."</p>
<p>Researchers expect to learn more as the science continues to develop. Even when ancient bones are not available, scientists today can get DNA from soil where ancient humans once lived.</p>
<p>And there are less-explored places in the world where researchers hope to learn more. Zeberg said "biobanks" that collect biological materials will likely be established in more countries.</p>
<p>As researchers go deeper into humanity's genetic legacy, scientists expect to find even more evidence of how much we mixed with our ancient cousins and all they left us.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Zeberg said, "we should not see them as so different."</p>

<p>Rickshaw comes from a Japanese word that means "human-powered vehicle." The vehicle was first used in 19th-century Japan and then in other Asian countries to transport passengers.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers are traditionally male. Through social media, some Japanese women are drawn to the profession. And now, they have developed a strong local and international following.</p>
<p>Yuka Akimoto is one of the women who have chosen to pull rickshaws in Tokyo.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rickshaw puller Akina Suzuki, 19, drives a rickshaw around Asakusa district in Tokyo, Japan, June 18, 2023. (REUTERS/Issei Kato)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4b5d-08dbbf85910b_cx7_cy16_cw81_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">Rickshaw puller Akina Suzuki, 19, drives a rickshaw around Asakusa district in Tokyo, Japan, June 18, 2023. (REUTERS/Issei Kato)</span></div>
<p>"I don't deny it was extremely hard at the beginning," Akimoto said, as the rickshaw can weigh up to 250 kg. "I'm not athletic and the cart felt so heavy."</p>
<p>Now, she says she loves her job and wants to work as long as she is physically able. She wears a small sign that reads: "I don't want to give up."</p>
<p>Akimoto joined Tokyo Rickshaw two years ago. The company mainly operates in the Asakusa area, where many people visit. The company says about a third of their 90 pullers are now women. They are seeking more females to work for the company.</p>
<p>"The first girl who joined was cool," said Tokyo Rickshaw President Ryuta Nishio. "Since we posted videos of her on social media, many girls have followed... and joined us."</p>
<p>Nishio said he wants to create a place where women feel at ease and can be involved.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers wear special, traditional clothing on their feet. The pullers walk or run an average of 20km a day, no matter the weather.</p>
<p>In addition to being physically strong, rickshaw pullers must know a lot about Tokyo. They also need to communicate with visitors who want to see the city.</p>
<p>The most popular pullers earn over 1 million yen (about $6,700) a month. That is three times the national average. Tokyo Rickshaw noted that less than 10 percent of all applicants are offered a job.</p>
<p>The pullers actively use social media to increase their popularity. They want people to request them personally and repeat rides.</p>
<p>It was those social media posts that influenced college student Yumeka Sakurai to join Tokyo Rickshaw.</p>
<p>"I've watched many videos of women training hard and becoming rickshaw drivers themselves. They gave me confidence that I could do it too if I tried hard," the 20-year-old said.</p>
<p>Sakurai's friends and family disapproved of her choice. But after four months of training, she says she feels pleasure pulling passengers in her rickshaw.</p>
<p>Shiori Yano is 29 years old. She has been pulling rickshaws for nine years. She balances the demands of the job and her family.</p>
<p>She took a four-year break after having a child. She now works the rickshaw for eight hours a day, hurrying to pick up her daughter from childcare before going home to cook dinner and do housework.</p>
<p>"This job looked flashy from the outside but I've had some hard times, including when I was rejected in favor of a male driver," Yano said. Still, she says she will continue to work because she enjoys it.</p>
<p>Tokyo Rickshaw's Nishio said sometimes people are not satisfied women are doing such physically demanding work. Female pullers also sometimes face unwanted sexual behaviors or have their knowledge questioned by male riders, he added.</p>
<p>"We treat both male and female pullers completely equally," Nishio said. "The women say they want to be treated the same as the men, and in fact many of them are way tougher."</p>

<p>Immigrants in America are more hopeful about the future than citizens who were born in the United States.</p>
<p>That is what a recent opinion study<strong> </strong>of 3,358 immigrant adults found.</p>
<p>The study, or survey, aimed to find out what the immigrant adults thought about a number of issues.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Rita Guevara of the Philippines, center, takes a photo with her family following a naturalization ceremony, Sept. 15, 2023, in Miami.

<p>Shannon Schumacher is a researcher at KFF, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco that works with health policy. It was formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<p>She described what the immigrants told her this way: "They said, ‘You know, I face <strong>challenges</strong> here in the U.S., but it's far better than where I came from. And I have this belief that things will be better for my children.'"</p>
<p>Schumacher added, "Whether that's their education, their safety, their economic <strong>opportunities</strong>...they think that they're better off and their children are better off."</p>
<p>The survey was a partnership between KFF and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> newspaper. The organizations carried out the study between April 10 and June 12, 2023.</p>
<p>The immigrants answered questions by telephone, mail, and online. The questions could be answered in any of the 10 most commonly spoken languages in the United States. They include English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Haitian-Creole, Arabic, French and Tagalog.</p>
<p>Schumacher said it is the most complete survey of immigrants in the U.S. today.</p>
<p>"The survey can really help inform the public more about immigrants and really bring their voices to the <strong>forefront</strong>," she said. Schumacher added, "We don't actually hear about immigrants often in their own voices."</p>
<p>Immigrants make up 16 percent of adults in the U.S. They come from many different countries and are from many classes of people. Their belief in a better future remains although they face many difficulties.</p>
<p>Most of the immigrants in the survey have jobs. About half said they have experienced discrimination in the workplace. Three in 10 said they had been paid less for doing the same job or have had fewer opportunities to get a better job or increased pay, compared to their U.S.-born coworkers.</p>
<p>Health care can be another problem. One in five immigrants delayed or did not get health care in the past few years. Often the reason is lack of money or health <strong>insurance</strong>. And if they see a medical worker, the experience is not always good.</p>
<p>Schumacher said: "About one in four immigrants say they've been treated unfairly in a health care setting, such as being <strong>talked down to</strong>." She added that they might not have a health care provider explain things in a way they can understand. They also might not have had someone explain issues in their language.</p>
<p>The survey said that Black and Hispanic immigrants face the most discrimination.</p>
<p>Researchers worked with activist groups within the different immigrant communities to find people to talk to. The researchers said the English word "discrimination" was a problem because it does not always mean the same thing in different cultures and languages.</p>
<p>"People aren't sure what that means," Schumacher said. She added that they might use different words, "or they say something that maybe we as researchers would say, ‘Oh, that's discrimination,' but they call it <strong>bullying</strong> or someone just being mean."</p>
<p>To deal with possible miscommunication, researchers asked direct questions to identify experiences that they defined as discrimination. They did this even if the survey subject did not call the experience "discrimination." For example, the researcher might ask: "Have you ever been not paid for all the hours you've worked?" "Have you been <strong>harassed</strong> or threatened or been told to go back to your country?"</p>

<p>Many elementary school teachers say they dislike the idea of teaching mathematics even at the most basic level. That is a cause for concern among educators.</p>
<p>Experts say it is <strong>critical</strong> for students to have a solid <strong>foundation</strong> in the subject because math skills build on each other. Research published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that math is a common cause of <strong>anxiety</strong> for adults, especially for women. About 90 percent of elementary teachers in the U.S. are women. The NIH study suggested that, in the field of education, anxiety can have a harmful effect on learners.</p>
<p>International studies have found that U.S. students are behind many other democracies in math skills. In 2017, the OECD, an international economic research group, ranked the U.S. 30th among member countries.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Elementary math teacher Margie Howells teaches a fifth-grade class at Wheeling Country Day School in Wheeling, WV, on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023.

Puskar)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/e09a75eb-78d7-4205-b5fb-8965169bf80b_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Elementary math teacher Margie Howells teaches a fifth-grade class at Wheeling Country Day School in Wheeling, WV, on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)</span></div>
<p>Since the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the math test scores in the U.S. suffered even more. Educators now say an important step to improving math skills after the pandemic is to increase the <strong>confidence</strong> of elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>The Erikson Institute in Chicago is a graduate school centered on child development. The school holds a yearly math conference where elementary teachers can ease their anxiety about math. Teachers find out how young children learn math and plan activities for the classroom.</p>
<p>Jennifer McCray is a research professor at Erikson. She said the best way to see how a child will perform in math up through eighth grade is to learn how the child did in math when they started <strong>kindergarten</strong>.</p>
<p>Teachers are worried that they will transfer their math fears to their students. Math specialists say this is a <strong>persistent</strong> issue in elementary school classrooms. Elementary school teachers are expected to teach every subject, often leading them to spend less classroom time on math.</p>
<p>During the Erikson Institute's summer meeting, teachers work with math concepts that they can use in the classroom. For example, the group built 10-sided shapes out of colored blocks. These exercises helped the teachers with their own math skills.</p>
<p>Lauran Solarski is a trainer with the Early Math Collaborative at Erikson. She told a group of educators, "There's a misbelief that in order to teach early childhood math, you don't really need to know math well."</p>
<p>Lisa Ginet is the director of operations at Erikson. She said that early childhood teachers do not necessarily need to be experts in complex math subjects like algebra and geometry. But they need to understand that many of the skills they are teaching are connected to mathematical thinking and to subjects that students will learn later in school.</p>
<p>Stacey Stevens works for the Kentucky Department of Education as the director of early childhood education training center. She said she changed her study major in college to early childhood education to avoid high level math. After she completed a yearlong class in math to improve her teaching, she finally started to understand how to teach the subject.</p>
<p>Stevens said she was <strong>passionate</strong> about teaching preschool because she did not want children to have the same struggles in math that she had growing up. "I wanted them to understand that four triangles make a square: to actually see it and do it and not just be told that a triangle is a fourth of a square."</p>
<p>Heather Peske is the president of the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ), a research group based in Washington, D.C. She said colleges need to better prepare teachers to teach math before they get into the classroom.</p>
<p>The NCTQ studied teacher preparation programs in 2022. It found that most do not spend as much time on elementary math content as NCTQ thinks is necessary. The recommendations were based on studies that linked student <strong>achievement</strong> to teacher's math studies in college.</p>
<p>Peske said, "If we prepared them better, they would be stronger at both their math knowledge as well as their ability to teach math, and this would reduce their anxiety and improve student outcomes."</p>

            <title>'Boilerplate' Language Is All Business  (2023/10/1)</title>

<span class="datetime">30 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about a type of writing -- boilerplate. Boilerplate language is the writing in documents such as contracts. The language is <strong>standardized</strong>. This means the words are well established and used by many people. The language is widely recognized as acceptable. It is not creative, nor does it change very much.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pages from a Carlyle Group 2021 report on its financial risk from greenhouse gas emissions are photographed Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022. Documents and contracts often contain what is called boilerplate language.

<p>So, when it comes to things like business documents, legal contracts, and <strong>training manuals</strong>, boilerplate is a good thing. You don't need or want creative language in those sorts of documents.</p>
<p>However, in writing other kinds of stories, boilerplate has a different meaning.</p>
<p>If a piece of writing is not special or creative, we can call it boilerplate. The words <strong>hackneyed </strong>and <strong>trite</strong> have related meanings. Hackneyed or trite writing is commonplace and repeated too often. There is nothing special about boilerplate writing.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear boilerplate used in some examples.</p>
<p><em>I'm not signing any contract without my lawyer looking at it first. I don't care how boilerplate it is. </em></p>
<p><em>The writing in the novel was boilerplate. It showed no creativity. </em></p>
<p><em>The writing job was not difficult for the college student. It was mostly boilerplate type stories. </em></p>
<p><strong>Where did "boilerplate" come from?</strong></p>
<p>The website Meriam-Webster.com explains how the term "boilerplate" came to mean standard or non-creative writing.</p>
<p>Boilerplate comes from <strong>syndicated</strong> stories used especially by weekly newspapers. These stories were ready-to-print and required no additional writing.</p>
<p>Boilerplate stories were not usually hard news. They were stories that just filled space in the newspaper. So, the term boilerplate can mean ordinary, <strong>mediocre</strong> writing.</p>
<p>In the past, these stories were sent on flat, metal plates. These story plates looked like plates used to make steam boilers, devices used to make steam for heat or power. So, they were called "boiler plates." Soon, the term "boilerplate" came to mean the actual printed material on the plates as well as to the plates themselves.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Hopefully, you don't find our materials at VOA Learning English to be boilerplate.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was related to an earlier president with same last name, Theodore Roosevelt. Many Americans call Franklin Roosevelt by the first letter of each word in his full name: FDR.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Franklin D. Roosevelt" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7839e5c5-a69d-40ca-b953-5e64fe4efbf2_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Franklin D. Roosevelt</span></div>
<p>When FDR took office, the United States was in a severe economic depression. The previous president, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-herbert-hoover/4037382.html">Herbert Hoover</a>, had tried to improve the economy, but his efforts had failed.</p>
<p>FDR defeated Hoover in the election of 1932. He won, in part, by promising what he called a "new deal" for Americans.</p>
<p>Voters did not know what FDR's "new deal" meant exactly, but many liked his message of hope.</p>
<p>Voters also did not know how much FDR would change the country. He remained in office for 12 years – the longest of any U.S. president – and led the country through the Great Depression and most of World War II.</p>
<p>Along the way, he changed the way government affected Americans' lives, and the job of the U.S. president.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt was born on a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nps.gov/hofr/index.htm">large <strong>estate</strong></a> in New York, about 140 kilometers outside New York City. He was the only child of wealthy parents.</p>
<p>His mother and father made sure he had an excellent education. As a young man he attended a private high school, and then Harvard College in Massachusetts. He also studied law at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>Young FDR was not an excellent student, however. He was interested in many things outside the classroom, including politics and girls.</p>
<p>Two of FDR's interests came together in a young woman named Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, who went by the name Eleanor. She was the <strong>niece</strong> of a politician FDR greatly respected: President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>On the day when Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were married, Theodore Roosevelt attended the ceremony. In fact, he walked with his niece in front of the guests to her future husband.</p>
<p>Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt went on to have six children, although one died as a baby.</p>
<p>While Eleanor Roosevelt raised the children, Franklin Roosevelt directed his attention to politics.</p>
<p>He left a job in a law office to serve in the New York state senate. In time, he was offered a job in the federal government as an assistant secretary of the Navy.</p>
<p>FDR enjoyed the job, but he continued seeking other political positions. He tried unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. Senate, but did get nominated by the Democratic Party to be its vice presidential candidate in 1920.</p>
<p>Although he and his partner lost the race, FDR seemed like he was in a good position for major political success.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened.</p>
<p><strong>Illness and return to politics</strong></p>
<p>When he was 39 years old, FDR suffered <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/10/31/roosevelt.polio.reut/">major health problems</a>. One day he started to feel a pain in his back. The following day his legs grew tired. Then his skin became sensitive.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, both his legs were <strong>paralyzed</strong>. He could not move from the waist down. He remained paralyzed for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The next years were difficult for the Roosevelts. Eleanor and the children helped care for FDR. And he worked hard to recover some of his strength and physical abilities, especially by exercising.</p>
<p>While he remained hopeful about his condition, FDR worried about his political career. He did not think the public would accept a leader who could not even walk by himself. So he took several measures.</p>
<p>He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://fdrlibrary.org/polio">created a small wheelchair</a> that would not get too much attention. It was made from a dining room chair, with wheels instead of legs.</p>
<p>He refused to let photographers take pictures of him being carried or struggling to move, and he found a way to appear as if he were walking. He used a cane or the arm of a partner to balance, and then he <strong>swung</strong> his hips to make his legs move forward.</p>
<p>Using this method, FDR "walked" to the <strong>stage</strong> at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. He used the event to nominate the governor of New York for president.</p>
<p>That man's bid did not succeed. But FDR showed himself to still be an able politician.</p>
<p>Four years later, FDR himself was elected governor of New York. He held the position in the early years of the country's economic crisis.</p>
<p>In 1932, FDR was a candidate for president. He took the unusual step of appearing in person at the Democratic convention to accept his party's nomination.</p>
<p>His campaign was such a success that the Democrats took not only the White House, but majorities in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The strength of the Democratic Party in Congress would help FDR become one of the most powerful presidents the country had ever seen.</p>
<p>Next week we will continue our story of FDR and his presidency.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has long worked to make her city less dependent on cars. She wanted to see more people using bicycles, or bikes, to get around.<br/>
巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈长期以来一直致力于减少城市对汽车的依赖。她希望看到更多的人骑自行车四处走动。</p>
<p>Over a number of years, the city government put in restrictions on cars and increased the amount of bike lanes from 200 kilometers to over 1,000 kilometers.<br/>
多年来，市政府对汽车进行了限制，并将自行车道的长度从200公里增加到1000公里以上。</p>
<p>Now, her effort seems to have paid off.<br/>
现在，她的努力似乎得到了回报。</p>
<p>This year, Parisians are not complaining about too much automobile traffic. Instead, they say there are too many bikes.<br/>
今年，巴黎人并没有抱怨汽车流量过大。相反，他们说自行车太多了。</p>
<p>Thibault Quere is a spokesperson for France's Federation of Bicycle Users. He said he remembered seeing "traffic jams all over the place" when he traveled by car as a child.<br/>
蒂伯·奎尔是法国自行车用户联合会的发言人。他说，他记得小时候乘车旅行时看到“到处都是交通堵塞”。</p>
<p>"Now, it's really like a bike traffic jam," he said. "It's kind of a good difficulty to have, especially when we think about what Paris used to be."<br/>
他说：“现在成了自行车交通堵塞，这是我们遇到的一个很大的困难，尤其是当我们想到巴黎曾经的样子时。”</p>

<p>Experts say the revolution will continue. Instead of the honking of horns and pollutive gas from cars, Paris will become known for cyclists, they say.<br/>
专家表示，这场革命将继续下去。他们说，巴黎将以骑自行车而闻名，而不是喇叭声和汽车尾气污染。</p>
<p>The city will host the summer Olympics in 2024 and plans to add more bike lanes by then.

该市将于2024年举办夏季奥运会，并计划届时增加更多自行车道。巴黎希望在奥运会期间将污染减少一半，尽管来自世界各地的游客将到巴黎参加奥运会。组织者表示，所有比赛场地都将能通过60公里的自行车道网络骑自行车到达。</p>
<p>The change to Paris, however, has not been easy. With more people using bikes, more people are making mistakes. Some of them are new to cycling and disobey traffic rules.<br/>

<span class="datetime">29 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>The average life expectancy of North America's largest and rarest tortoise species is unknown. But scientists say the animals could live more than 100 years.</p>
<p>The Bolson tortoise is an endangered <strong>species</strong>. Saving it from <strong>extinction</strong> is a long-term project. But a conservation effort took a step toward that goal last week.</p>
<p>United States wildlife officials reached an agreement with the Turner Endangered Species Fund. The deal permits the release of Bolson tortoises on land owned by Ted Turner, a media industry leader.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Gertie, an endangered Bolson tortoise, is shown to a group of state and federal wildlife officials during a trip to Ted Turner's Armendaris Ranch in Engle, N.M., on Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

<p>The release of captive tortoises on the Armendaris Ranch is designed to create a free-<strong>roaming</strong> population. Last week, 20 adult tortoises were released on the property, which is already home to 23 of them. There are also many younger tortoises.</p>
<p>The tortoises usually spend about 85 percent of the time in their underground <strong>burrows</strong>, which in some cases can be about 20 meters long. The animals live long lives and are slow to reproduce.</p>
<p>Shawn Sartorius is with the Fish and Wildlife Service. He said the results of the <strong>breeding</strong> and restoration project will not be seen in his lifetime.</p>
<p>"What we're doing here is establishing a population here that can be handed off to the next generation," Sartorius said.</p>
<p>It is a step toward one day releasing the tortoises in more places in the Southwest. Conservationists are also pushing the federal government to consider creating a recovery plan for the species. The tortoise is part of a growing effort to find new homes for endangered species as they flee climate change and other threats to their natural <strong>habitats</strong>.</p>
<p>Wild Bolson tortoises are found only in the grasslands of north-central Mexico. The animal once lived in a much greater area that included the southwestern United States. <strong>Fossil</strong> records also show it was once present it the southern Great Plains, including parts of Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Scientists estimate the wild population of Bolson tortoises in Mexico is under 2,500. Experts say the animals are hunted as food and as pets. Their habitat is shrinking, as more desert grasslands become farmland.</p>
<p>The 1,450 square kilometer Armendaris Ranch appears to be a great area for the tortoises. In all, the Turner Endangered Species Fund and its partners have been able to grow the population from 30 tortoises to about 800, said Chris Wiese. She leads the project at the Armendaris Ranch.</p>
<p>"The releases are the <strong>essential</strong> step to getting them back on the ground and letting them be wild tortoises," she said.</p>
<p>The tortoises released last week will be able to live freely in the 6.6-hectare <strong>pen</strong>. They are given electronic trackers, and wildlife workers will check on them once a year.</p>
<p>Depending on weather and other factors, it can take a few years or more for a hatchling to reach just over 110 millimeters long. They can eventually grow to about 370 millimeters.</p>
<p>The species was unknown to science until the late 1950s and has not been studied closely.</p>
<p>The goal is to build a strong captive population that can be used as research for future releases into the wild — both in the U.S. and Mexico. That work will include getting state and federal permits to release tortoises outside Turner lands.</p>
<p>Those recently released hit the ground crawling. They wandered through grass and around desert plants as the Fra Cristobal mountain range appeared in the distance.</p>
<p>It was a moment that Wiese and her team have been working toward for years.</p>
<p>"We are not in the business of making pets," she said. "We're in the business of making wild animals and that means you have to let them go."</p>

            <title>Teacher, Lecturer or Tutor?  (2023/9/30)</title>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between a "teacher," a "tutor," and a "lecturer."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Teacher, Lecturer or Tutor? " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-9348-08dbc06138a2_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Teacher, Lecturer or Tutor? </span></div>
<p>My name is Saddam, and I am from Uganda in Africa.</p>
<p>I request your help to differentiate between three words and their deep meanings: "teacher," "lecturer" and "tutor."</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Saddam</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for this great question, Saddam. All three words are nouns used to describe educators. All three teach students in different ways and have different experiences and <strong>qualifications</strong>. Let's look at each word so we understand the differences.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher</strong></p>
<p>A teacher is a professional educator who teaches students.</p>
<p>When we think of a teacher, we see a smaller classroom with 15 to 25 students. A teacher might teach in front of the class or go around to work with individual students.</p>
<p>In the United States, we call those who teach students up to 12th-<strong>grade</strong> teachers. They teach all subjects in elementary school or specific subjects like math, English or history in middle or high school.</p>
<p>Teachers are usually required to have an advanced degree, such as a master's in education. They also must pass a certification or test in general teaching knowledge and specific subjects.</p>
<p><em>Ms. Leslie is a first-year elementary school teacher. She recently completed her certifications and spent many hours in a classroom helping another teacher. </em></p>
<p><strong>Lecturer </strong></p>
<p>A lecturer, or professor, is an educator who teaches in colleges or universities.</p>
<p>Lecturers often teach larger classes and stand in front of a big room. For one-on-one time with students, they meet outside the classroom during office hours.</p>
<p>Lecturers or professors usually have an advanced degree, like a Master's or Ph. D, in their subject or special field of study.</p>
<p><em>Angela is an economics lecturer at a university. She has a Ph.D., but this is her first year of full-time teaching. </em></p>
<p><strong>Tutor</strong></p>
<p>A tutor is an educator who specializes in a certain subject or content area. Tutors usually help students one-on-one or in small groups.</p>
<p>They do not need a degree. However, some professional tutors have at least a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>High school students can be tutors to other students if they have advanced knowledge in a subject.</p>
<p>Tutors usually give study help to students at different times, like in the evening or on the weekends. They make lessons more personal and help students with specific problems.</p>
<p><em>I have a big English test coming up, so I am meeting with my tutor after school every day this week so I can be prepared. </em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Saddam.</p>
<p>Do you have a question about American English? Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com">learningenglish@voanews.com</a>.</p>

            <title>Scientists Recover Genetic RNA from Extinct Tasmanian Tiger  (2023/9/29)</title>

<p>Researchers say they have recovered genetic material from the Tasmanian tiger, an Australian animal that has long been <strong>extinct</strong>. The discovery could help scientists learn more about these creatures before they disappeared from Earth.</p>
<p>The recovered material is called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. RNA is a group of molecules present in all living cells that is important for genetic activity. It is similar to DNA, the molecules that contain an organism's genetic instructions.</p>
<p>RNA carries genetic information it receives from DNA. RNA combines groups of proteins that organisms require to live and works to control cell <strong>metabolism</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The remains of an extinct Tasmanian tiger from a collection at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm are seen in this undated handout image. (Emilio Marmol Sanchez/Handout via REUTERS)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-0932-08dbbe9903b5_cx34_cy0_cw65_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The remains of an extinct Tasmanian tiger from a collection at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm are seen in this undated handout image. (Emilio Marmol Sanchez/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The researchers said the recovered RNA came from skin and muscle from the remains of a Tasmanian tiger stored since 1891 in a museum in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>Scientists have in recent years taken DNA from different ancient animals and plants. But the team said it was the first time RNA has been recovered from an extinct animal.</p>
<p>Scientists believe the Tasmanian tiger once lived on the Australian continent and surrounding islands. It was a top <strong>predator</strong> at the time, hunting kangaroos and other animals. The last known Tasmanian tiger is believed to have died in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936.</p>
<p>Emilio Mármol Sánchez is with the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm. He was the lead writer of a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2023/07/18/gr.277663.123.abstract">study</a> describing the research results. The study recently appeared in the publication <em>Genome Research</em>.</p>
<p>Sánchez told Reuters news service RNA material gives scientists "a taste of the real biology" involving the cells and tissues of the Tasmanian tigers before they went extinct.</p>
<p>Marc Friedl<i></i>228;nder of Stockholm University was a co-writer of the study. He said, "If we want to understand extinct species, we need to understand what gene <strong>complements</strong> they have and also what the genes were doing, and which were active."</p>
<p>Researchers have questioned how long RNA could survive at room temperature. The remains stored at the Swedish Natural History Museum were in a state of semi-<strong>mummification. </strong>This means<strong> </strong>skin, muscles and bones remained, but inside organs were lost.</p>
<p>"Most researchers thought that RNA would only survive for a very short time - like days or weeks - at room temperature," said evolutionary geneticist Love Dalén. He is with the Centre for Palaeogenetics. Dalén added that while this might be the case when remains are wet, it does not appear to be so when they are dried.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian tiger looked similar to a wolf, except for the tiger-like lines appearing on its back. When people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago, large animal population losses followed. The arrival of European colonizers in the 18<sup>th</sup> century destroyed the remaining populations around the island of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Private "de-extinction" programs have been launched with the aim of bringing back some extinct animals. These include the Tasmanian tiger, flightless dodo bird and wooly mammoth.</p>
<p>However, many researchers have warned about the difficulties of using genetic processes to actually recreate an extinct species. While Sánchez of the Centre for Palaeogenetics said he too has concerns about such processes, he noted that he does "<strong>advocate </strong>for more research on the biology of these extinct animals."</p>

            <title>Indoor Food Growing Operations Face Uncertain Future  (2023/9/29)</title>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Indoor food growing operations are seeing both successes and failures in the United States. Some companies in the food industry are investing even as competitors fail.</p>
<p>California-based Plenty Unlimited this summer began work on a $300 million indoor plant, while Kroger announced that it will be increasing its availability of <strong>vertically</strong> farmed produce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two indoor farming companies that got strong backing — New Jersey's AeroFarms and Kentucky's AppHarvest — filed for <strong>bankruptcy </strong>reorganization. And a five-year-old company in Detroit, Planted Detroit, shut its doors this summer.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Aaron Fields looks at produce growing in vertical farm green house he manages at Eden Green Technology in Cleburne, Texas, Aug. 29, 2023. (AP Photo/LM Otero)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/b4676747-ad10-4c54-a4a9-bf342401e533_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Aaron Fields looks at produce growing in vertical farm green house he manages at Eden Green Technology in Cleburne, Texas, Aug. 29, 2023. (AP Photo/LM Otero)</span></div>
<p>The industry changes do not worry Jacob Portillo, a grower with Eden Green Technology, an indoor farming company.</p>
<p>"The fact that other people are failing and other people are succeeding, that's going to happen in any industry you go to, but specifically for us, I think that ... the <strong>sustainable</strong> competitors ... are going to start winning," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Support and criticism of indoor farming </strong></p>
<p>Indoor farming brings growing inside in what experts sometimes call "controlled environment agriculture." There are different methods. One method called vertical farming involves <strong>stacking</strong> produce from floor to ceiling, often under artificial lights and with the plants growing in nutrient-enriched water. Other growers are trying very large greenhouses, indoor beds of soil in big buildings and using special robots for parts of the farming process.</p>
<p>Supporters say growing indoors uses less water and land and permits food to be grown closer to consumers, saving on transport. Indoor growing is also a way to protect crops from increasingly extreme weather caused by climate change. The companies often say their products are free of <strong>pesticides</strong>, although the foods are usually not marketed as <strong>organic</strong>.</p>
<p>But critics question the sustainability of operations that can require a lot of energy for artificial light. And they say paying for that light can make profitability impossible.</p>
<p>Tom Kimmerer is a plant expert who taught at the University of Kentucky. Kimmerer has followed indoor farming alongside his research into the growth of plants both outdoors and inside. He said his first thought on vertical farm companies — especially those that used a lot of artificial light — was, "Boy, this is a <strong>dumb</strong> idea," mainly due to high energy costs.</p>
<p>The industry has admitted those high costs. Some companies are seeking to push costs down by using solar power. But even the companies that use a lot of artificial light that does not come from renewables say they can be profitable by eventually producing a high volume of produce year-round.</p>
<p>But Kimmerer thinks there are better ways to provide food locally and extend the growing season — outdoors. He pointed to Elmwood Stock Farm outside Lexington, Kentucky. The farm can grow tomatoes and greens the whole year using tools like high tunnels, also known as hoop houses. These are greenhouse-like structures that protect crops while still being partially open to the outdoors.</p>
<p>He thinks investment flowing toward new versions of indoor farming would be better spent on solutions for outdoor farmers like special robots, or money support for <strong>regenerative practices</strong>.</p>
<p>Curt Covington of AgAmerica Lending, a private investment company centered on agriculture, is not convinced that indoor farming operations can work - except in special cases.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of indoor operations, Covington said, "It's just hard... to be very profitable."</p>

<p>Kai Koerber was a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida when a gunman murdered 14 students and three school workers there in February 2018. Seeing other students and himself struggle to return to normal, Koerber wanted to do something to help people deal with their emotions.</p>
<p>Some of his classmates from the school have <strong>advocated</strong> for gun control policies or entered politics. Some took time to heal and work on their studies. Koerber's background in technology led him in a different direction: to build a smartphone app.</p>
<p>The result was Joy: AI Wellness Platform. It uses artificial intelligence to suggest small mindfulness activities for people based on how they are feeling. The <strong>algorithm</strong> is designed to recognize how a person feels from the sound of their voice. It does not matter the words or language they speak.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kai Koerber poses for a photograph Thursday, July 27, 2023, in Berkeley, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A.

<p>Like many of his fellow students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Koerber said he suffered from <strong>post-traumatic stress disorder </strong>for a "very long time." Only recently has it eased a little.</p>
<p>Koerber started a research team at the University of California at Berkeley to build an AI tool to see if his idea was possible.</p>
<p>The idea was a platform that provides those struggling with a "wellness <strong>practice</strong> on the go that meets our emotional needs on the go."</p>
<p>He said it was important to offer quick activities. Sometimes the activities last just a few seconds and can be done anywhere the user might be.</p>
<p>Mohammed Zareef-Mustafa is a former classmate of Koerber's. He has been using the app for a few months.</p>
<p>"I use the app about three times a week, because the practices are short and easy to get into," Zareef-Mustafa said. "It really helps me quickly de-stress before I have to do things like job interviews."</p>
<p>To use Joy, the user simply speaks into the app over a phone or computer. The AI is supposed to recognize how you are feeling from your voice, then suggest short activities.</p>
<p>If the user is feeling "neutral," the app suggests several activities, like a 15-second exercise called "mindful <strong>consumption</strong>." It gets you to "think about all the lives and beings involved in producing what you eat or use that day."</p>
<p>Another activity calls for practicing how to make an effective apology. Another asks users write a letter to their future self. One suggestion asks sad users to track how many times they have laughed over a seven-day period. The user is supposed to count the laughs up at the end of the week to see what moments made them happy.</p>
<p>The iPhone app costs $8 a month. It is a work in progress. And like other AI tools, the more people use it, the better it becomes.</p>
<p>Many wellness apps on the market claim to help people with mental health issues, but it is not always clear whether they work, said Colin Walsh. He is a professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University and has studied the use of AI in suicide prevention.</p>
<p>The <strong>stakes</strong> also matter. Facebook, for instance, has faced some criticism in the past for its suicide prevention tool. It used AI as well as humans to identify users who may be considering suicide. If the technology is simply directing someone to spend some time outside, and the stakes are lower, it is unlikely to cause harm, Walsh said.</p>
<p>Koerber said people often forget, after mass shootings, that survivors do not "<strong>bounce</strong> back right away" from the experience<strong>.</strong> It takes years to recover, he said.</p>
<p>His work has also been slower and more thoughtful than tech business leaders of the past, he added.</p>
<p>"I guess young Mark Zuckerberg was very ‘move fast and break things,'" Koerber said. "And for me, I'm all about building quality products that ... serve social good in the end."</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Over the last several months, there have been many news reports about possible <strong>alien</strong> life and strange objects in the skies, sometimes called UFOs. The stories have led to public discussion in the United States. Today, we have some English terms and structures to share that can help learners take part in the discussion, too.</p>
<p><strong>Do + believe</strong></p>
<p>Let's start with the basic yes/no question of, "Do you believe in aliens?"</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Discussing Alien Life " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-2a32-08dbbf752678_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Discussing Alien Life </span></div>
<p>The verb "believe" is common to hear when talking about non-Earth life in the universe. To "believe" something means to accept something as true. Simple answers to this question are:</p>
<p><em>Yes, I believe in aliens.</em></p>
<p><em>No, I do not believe in them.</em></p>
<p>If you want to <strong>emphasize</strong> that you believe in aliens, you can use "do" before the main verb of "believe" in the positive form. This gives extra emphasis to the main verb. The stress would be on the verb "do" when you speak.</p>
<p><em>I do believe in aliens.</em></p>
<p><em>I do believe that we are not alone in the universe. </em></p>
<p><strong>Adverbs of possibility </strong></p>
<p>Another way we can express our opinion about aliens is through adverbs of possibility. Possibility is the likelihood of something happening.</p>
<p>There are adverbs to show a stronger chance of something happening, like the adverbs "definitely" or "certainly." And there are adverbs to show a weaker chance or probability of something occurring like "maybe," "probably" or "perhaps."</p>
<p>Let's look at short dialogue using these adverbs of possibility.</p>
<p><em>Carlos: Do you believe in aliens, Joy?</em></p>
<p><em>Joy: I certainly believe in aliens. I think they are definitely among us.</em></p>
<p><em>Carlos: So, you believe the sightings of UFOs are true?</em></p>
<p><em>Joy: Clearly! The UFOs are probably held in <strong>Area 51</strong>! </em></p>
<p><em>Carlos: Maybe, they are not enemies. Perhaps, they want to be friendly. </em></p>
<p>Joy uses three strong adverbs to express her opinion and show the chance of something happening.</p>
<p>The adverbs "certainly" and "clearly" are used to add emphasis and <strong>confidence</strong> to Joy's opinions about aliens. She uses the strong adverb "definitely" to show that she thinks there is a strong possibility that aliens might already live among humans.</p>
<p>Joy also uses a weaker adverb of "probably" to express that she thinks that UFOs might be held in Area 51.</p>
<p>Notice the placement of the adverbs. Typically, we place adverbs before the main verb in the sentence.</p>
<p><em>I certainly believe in aliens</em></p>
<p>But some adverbs like "maybe" and "perhaps" can be used in the beginning of sentences.</p>
<p><em>Carlos said, "Maybe, they are not enemies. Perhaps, they want to be friendly." </em></p>
<p>Next, we have the placement of adverbs with auxiliary verbs like "be" or "have." Adverbs always come after the auxiliary verb, but before the base verb, like in these examples:</p>
<p><em>I think they are definitely among us. </em></p>
<p><em>The UFOs are probably held in Area 51.</em></p>
<p>And lastly, adverbs can be used as interjections or at the beginning of sentences. Interjections are short statements that show more of a feeling and are grammatically independent from other sentences. They usually have an exclamation mark (!) as <strong>punctuation</strong>.</p>
<p>Joy uses the adverb "clearly" as an interjection to answer Carlos' question about UFO sightings.</p>
<p>Carlos then answers Joy using the adverbs "maybe" and "perhaps" to express his opinion about the chance that aliens are friendly. He uses the weaker adverbs here. "Maybe" and "perhaps" often come in the beginning of the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Today we looked at how we can express our opinion of alien life. The verb "believe" is often used to express if we accept aliens as true. We can use the verb "do" in front of the main verb in the positive to give extra emphasis to our belief.</p>
<p>And we looked at the use of adverbs of possibility. We can use stronger adverbs such as "definitely" or "clearly" to say that there is a greater chance of something and to add emphasis to our opinions. Weaker adverbs such as "maybe" and "perhaps" can express that the likelihood of something is less. And finally, we looked at the placement of those adverbs within sentences.</p>
<p>Now it is your turn. Share your opinions of aliens using the expressions and grammar above. Do you believe in life outside of Earth? Are there aliens among us? Let us know in an email to learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>

            <title>ChatGPT Expands with Voice and Image Abilities  (2023/9/28)</title>

<span class="datetime">27 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>The artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT has added new abilities that include voice and image recognition.</p>
<p>The changes permit some users to directly ask ChatGPT questions and receive voice answers. In addition, the tool can recognize images and provide information about what is in them.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a chatbot, a computer-powered tool designed to interact smoothly with humans and perform high-level writing. The technology is also known as "generative AI."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The ChatGPT logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1c54ef73-dc14-4b4b-bd14-52d1e08d3d6e_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The ChatGPT logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)</span></div>
<p>The creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/business-and-tech/20230925-chatgpt-ai-getting-chatty-with-voice-prompts">announced</a> the tool's latest additions, or upgrades, this week. Currently, the new voice and image upgrades are only available to users of ChatGPT's Plus and Enterprise services.</p>
<p>ChatGPT's main service, called GPT-3.5, is free for all users. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. The Enterprise service is designed for individual companies, with costs tied to the services used by the business.</p>
<p>OpenAI explained that ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users would be able to use the voice and image additions over the next two weeks. The upgraded tools would be made available to other groups of users, including developers, "soon after." The voice and image upgrades will also be added to devices using the iOS and Android systems in the near future.</p>
<p>The company said ChatGPT's new voice control is designed to provide a natural way for users to communicate with the AI tool in a way that is similar to speaking with a human. But it noted the chatbot can do more than answer questions. It can also tell a story to children or provide detailed <strong>instructions</strong> for making or building something.</p>
<p>Users can choose different voices they want the chatbot to use. The company said it worked closely with professional voice actors to make the interactions more realistic and personal.</p>
<p>The voice interaction ability of the ChatGPT upgrade already exists in many voice assistance systems. These include Amazon's Alexa, Alphabet's Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and others. American software maker Microsoft added voice controls to its new ChatGPT-powered Bing search engine earlier this year.</p>
<p>Another notable change to the ChatGPT tool is image recognition. This permits users to upload a photo to the system and then get information about what is contained in the picture.</p>
<p>For example, the company says a user could take a picture of what is currently available in their <strong>refrigerator</strong>. After entering the photo into ChatGPT, the tool could suggest dinner possibilities based on what the person has. The system could also provide step-by-step instructions for preparing the meal.</p>
<p>Another example given is a parent who might take a picture of a child's math problem and then seek advice on how to explain to the child how to solve it. There is even a way for users to mark areas of the image – for example with a circle – to get more specific information or help with that element.</p>
<p>Along with its announcement, OpenAI issued another warning about how its ChatGPT tool can easily get things wrong. It noted that because the system is trained using massive amounts of publicly available information, it can return results that are false, outdated or discriminatory.</p>
<p>The company urged all its users to watch out for misinformation and to attempt to <strong>verify</strong> the information provided by chatbots.</p>
<p>OpenAI announced its AI technology is also being used by the digital music service Spotify. ChatGPT is being used to power a system designed to permit Spotify podcasters to <strong>translate</strong> their shows into different languages. The translations are completed in the podcasters' own voice in an effort to make them sound more natural, OpenAI said.</p>
<p>Spotify says the first languages to be added in the coming weeks will be Spanish, French and German.</p>

            <title>Study: Warming Temperatures Threaten Ocean’s Biggest Fish  (2023/9/28)</title>

<p>A new study has warned that warming ocean temperatures could threaten some of the largest fish in the sea.</p>
<p>Many scientists believe warming waters are directly linked to the effects of climate change. Research has shown that rising sea temperatures are especially dangerous for larger fish because warmer waters can harm their open-water environments.</p>
<p>In one recent study, researchers estimated some larger fish <strong>species</strong> could lose up to 70 percent of their environment, or habitat, by the year 2100. These habitat losses could largely remove some of the most economically valuable fish species. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts carried out the study.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Andrew Lebel battles an Atlantic bluefin tuna while Capt.

<p>The warning comes after temperatures around the world reached record highs in July. Some scientists blame the Pacific Ocean current known as El Ni<i></i>241;o for the recent heat waves.</p>
<p>El Ni<i></i>241;o is a warming of surface water temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. The event usually causes hot, dry weather in Asia and Australia. It can also lead to heavier rain in the southern U.S. and southern parts of South America.</p>
<p>Large fish – such as marlin, skipjack and others – live in areas considered among the fastest warming.</p>
<p>Camrin Braun is an ocean scientist and the lead writer of the Woods Hole study. He told the Associated Press that temperatures in those environments are expected to rise as much as six degrees Celsius by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Such increases would likely start a widespread displacement of the animals, Braun said. "For sure, their habitat will change. How they respond to that is an open question," he added.</p>
<p>Climate scientists have been studying the heating of the world's oceans for many years. Earlier in 2023, average ocean surface temperatures climbed two-tenths of a degree Celsius in a period of just a few weeks. The jump surprised even scientists who are used to seeing continued rising temperatures.</p>
<p>For large species, longer periods of warming can be harmful because of the animals' temperature needs, said Janet Duffy-Anderson. She is chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine. Duffy-Anderson said large fish are often highly migratory. Increased warming could result in some species moving to northern or deeper waters in search of normal temperatures, she added.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Maine lies off the northeastern US and Canada. It is warming especially quickly. This is expected to cause big population movements, especially for species of marlin and tuna.</p>
<p>Large fish are important to healthy oceans because many of them, such as white sharks, are <strong>predators</strong> serving as critical pieces of the top of the <strong>food chain</strong>. Some species are also economically important to humans as food.</p>
<p>The possible loss of large fish is one of the many results of warming oceans that scientists have warned about this year. One study said the collapse of ocean currents that transport heat northward across the North Atlantic could happen by mid-century. In Florida, federal ocean researchers said some ocean coral were losing their color weeks earlier than normal because of record temperatures.</p>
<p>Penny Becker is with the Seattle-based environmental group Island Conservation. She told the AP the threat to large fish is another reason to raise awareness about the different ways climate change is affecting sea life. "If you're missing these <strong>components</strong> of these larger fish species, that's a missing hole in the ecosystem," Becker said.</p>

<p>"Leaf-peepers" are <strong>tourists </strong>who visit the countryside in the northeastern United States each autumn. "Peeper" means looker, someone who looks.</p>
<p>The leaf-peepers travel to see the seasonal changes to the trees. Their leaves turn color from green to deep red, bright yellow and rich orange before finally falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Many leaf-peepers head to Vermont. They like to take photos of the trees, the hills, old farm buildings and houses in the state.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cars line a narrow road outside a private property in an undated photo, in Pomfret, Vt., that has become a destination for fall foliage viewers, clogging the rural road. (AP Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/ce46e019-2dae-4934-91a5-31f17d061245_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Cars line a narrow road outside a private property in an undated photo, in Pomfret, Vt., that has become a destination for fall foliage viewers, clogging the rural road. (AP Photo)</span></div>
<p>They often stop their vehicles on the side of the road to take pictures. The visitors are good for the local economy because they spend money on hotels, restaurants and other business.</p>
<p>But, the flood of tourists can also cause problems in small, usually quiet country towns. They create too much vehicle traffic, pollution and other trouble.</p>
<p>One small town has taken surprising action to deal with the leaf-peepers. Pomfret, Vermont has closed roads to non-residents through the middle of October. Pomfret officials said the restrictions were carried out in reaction to what they called "poorly behaved tourists."</p>
<p>Visitors often seek out Sleepy Hollow Farm in Promfret. They like to take pictures there. Police now are guarding the road from all but locals.</p>
<p>The colorful hillside behind the farm is famous from the many images of it posted to social media services such as Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>People who live in central Vermont say they understand how the land's beauty appeals to visitors. But they say the traffic slowdowns, blocked roads and bad behavior by visitors is a major problem.</p>
<p>Nancy Bassett lives in the area. "It's just a <strong>shame</strong>," she said about the bad behavior, which includes some people trying to move beyond barriers to get better views. "It <strong>spoils </strong>it for a lot of people," Bassett added.</p>
<p>Vermont is not the only pretty place that some argue has been ruined by social media. People have crowded into small streets in Paris and wilderness areas in California just to take a photo like the ones they see on Instagram.</p>
<p>In the small city of Lake Elsinore, California, people stopped to take photos of a "superbloom" of wildflowers caused by a rainy winter in 2019. Locals said the visitors "<strong>trampled</strong>" the very flowers they came to <strong>photograph</strong>.</p>
<p>In some places, such as the famous Zion National Park in the western state of Utah, visitors need a permit to enter some areas.</p>
<p>The news of the Vermont closures prompted many to write about it on social media. One person asked: "Why in the world would you want to visit somewhere with a crowd of people? There are beautiful spots ... you can have all to yourself."</p>
<p>One road, Cloudland Road, is now closed to visitors. There are "no-parking" and "no-photo" signs along the way.</p>
<p>Residents say there are areas visitors can go that have parking and places to eat.</p>
<p>Linda Arbuckle works at a store nearby. She said "people love the leaves ... and it brings people here and we don't want that to stop. Unfortunately," she added, "some people have taken it to the next step." Arbuckle said there have been homeowners who have come home to see tourists eating a meal on their front <strong>porch</strong>.</p>

<p>Los Alamos in the Southwestern American state of New Mexico is where the U.S. government set up its secret mission to develop nuclear weapons during World War II.</p>
<p>Eighty years later, it is the home to huge government research and development laboratories.</p>
<p>Now, Los Alamos National Laboratory is taking part in the nation's largest nuclear weapons effort since World War II. The aim is to modernize America's nuclear weapons. New workers there are producing an important part of nuclear weapons – plutonium <strong>cores</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A sign marks a roadside rest stop that has been made to look like the historic security gate that all Manhattan Project workers passed through in Los Alamos, N.M., on June 26, 2023.

<p>The government has given jobs to about 3,300 workers in the last two years. The workforce is now over 17,270. Close to half of the workers live in some other part of New Mexico. The population of Los Alamos nearly doubles during the workweek.</p>
<p>While new technology has changed the way work is done at Los Alamos, some things remain the same. Secrecy and a sense of duty that came in the 1940s are still part of the community.</p>
<p>James Owen is an engineer. He has spent more than 25 years working in the nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>"What we do is meaningful. This isn't a job, it's a <strong>vocation</strong> and there's a sense of <strong>contribution</strong> that comes with that," Owens told The Associated Press. He added, "The downside is, we can't tell people about all the cool things we do here."</p>
<p>While the main goal of Los Alamos is <strong>maintaining</strong> America's nuclear weapons, the research center also works in other areas. These include energy, national security, space exploration, supercomputing, efforts to limit disease, and threats from computer attacks.</p>
<p>Employees say their work is necessary because of worldwide political insecurity. Most people in Los Alamos are connected to the laboratories, so opposition is rare.</p>
<p>But groups that follow nuclear development, such as activists and nonprofit organizations, question the need for nuclear weapons and the increasing costs.</p>
<p>Greg Mello is director of the Los Alamos Study Group. It is an organization that has disagreed with the laboratory over safety, security and cost concerns. He said, "For some time, Los Alamosans have seemed <strong>numbed</strong> out..."</p>
<p>Chistopher Nolan's recently released film <em>Oppenheimer </em>brought new attention to the town. The attention increased support for an effort to expand the federal government's radiation <strong>compensation</strong> program for a group of people in several western states. The group includes people in southern New Mexico where the Trinity Test of the first atomic bomb took place in 1945. In July, the U.S. Senate voted to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which would pay money to people who might have been affected by nuclear-related activity in the U.S.</p>
<p>The activist groups argue that the federal government's modernization effort has already gone above spending predictions. Additionally, they say the effort has taken years longer than planned. Independent government researchers released a report earlier this month that showed the growing costs and delays.</p>
<p>Owen said officials feel a sense of urgency because of increasing threats around the world. "What's being asked is that we all need to do better in a faster amount of time," he said.</p>

<p>Scientists say the lack of sea ice is evidence of serious climate change at the South Pole.<br/>
科学家表示，海冰的缺乏是南极气候变化严重的证据。</p>
<p>Researchers say the lack of sea ice will affect penguins, who mate and raise their young on the ice. In addition, a lack of ice speeds Earth's rising temperatures. A large amount of sea ice keeps the planet cool because it reflects sunlight back into space.<br/>
研究人员表示，海冰的缺乏将影响企鹅在冰上交配和养育幼崽。此外，海冰的缺乏会加速地球温度上升。大量的海冰使地球保持凉爽，因为它将阳光反射回太空。</p>
<p>The amount of sea ice was at its highest level on September 10, towards the end of the southern hemisphere's winter. However, it only covered 16.96 million square kilometers. That was the lowest coverage since satellite records began in 1979. The latest measurement breaks a low ice record from 1986 by about one million square kilometers.<br/>
9月10日，南半球冬季即将结束，海冰数量达到最高水平。然而，它只覆盖了1696万平方公里。这是自1979年有卫星记录以来的最低覆盖率。这次最新测量结果以大约为100万平方公里的差值打破了1986年以来的低冰记录。</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Researchers have found a structure that may be the oldest evidence yet of early humans building with wood.</p>
<p>The structure is simple: two logs, fitted together with a <strong>notch</strong>.</p>
<p>It is half a million years old. It provides a rare look at how ancient human relatives were working with wood and changing their environments, researchers wrote in a study published recently in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank">Nature</a>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by researchers, an excavation team uncovers a wooden structure found on a riverbed near a waterfall in Zambia in 2019.

(Larry Barham/University of Liverpool via AP)</span></div>
<p>Larry Barham of the University of Liverpool in Britain was one of the writers of the study. Barham said, "It took me a while before I <strong>appreciated</strong> what we were looking at." He added about the structure, "It didn't look very nice, to be honest. But it is much more complex than I thought."</p>
<p>Barham and his team dug up the log structure, and several wooden tools, from a riverbed area that sits above a waterfall in the African country of Zambia. They think the crossed logs could have been the base for a bigger structure like a walkway or a <strong>platform</strong>.</p>
<p>Barham explained that wood usually <strong>rots</strong> quickly due to the weather. As a result, little evidence remains of how our ancient relatives used the material. But the log structure that researchers found had been below the river's surface, which helped save them.</p>
<p>So when Barham's team found the logs in 2019, they were still able to see signs that early humans had shaped them.</p>
<p>"Everything just looks so fresh, you think, ‘It cannot be this old,'" Barham said.</p>
<p>It was difficult for researchers to estimate the age of the wood structure. Traditional dating techniques could not get deep enough into the past. In this study, researchers used a new method called "luminescence dating."</p>
<p>Luminescence dating uses tiny minerals in the sand to estimate how long materials have been buried, explained study writer Geoff Duller.</p>
<p>Duller is an expert in dating methods at Aberystwyth University in Wales.</p>
<p>The log structure was made at least 476,000 years ago, while the wood tools are slightly younger, under 400,000 years old. That places the materials in a time before our<strong> species</strong>, Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>The earliest-known Homo sapiens bones date from roughly 300,000 years ago in Morocco. The Kalambo Falls logs were determined to be from about 476,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The objects would have been made by another kind of early human relative — possibly Homo heidelbergensis, which was around in Africa at the time, the study's writers said.</p>
<p>Homo heidelbergensis had a bigger braincase and flatter face than earlier hominins - species on the human evolutionary <strong>lineage</strong>.</p>
<p>If these ancient humans were putting effort into building these structures, it suggests they may have stayed for a while or made repeated visits. In other words, they were not just groups of hunter-gatherers, said Dirk Leder of Germany's Lower Saxony State Office for Cultural Heritage. Leder was not involved with the research.</p>
<p>Annemieke Milks of Britain's University of Reading was also not involved in the study. Milks said about the finding, "It's an important window into what these humans were capable of."</p>

            <title>Sweden Brings Books, Handwriting Back to School  (2023/9/27)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>As children returned to school in Sweden last month, many of their teachers were putting a new importance on some traditional skills. These included reading printed books, quiet reading time and handwriting practice. Teachers were spending less time with digital devices, online research and <strong>typing</strong> skills.</p>
<p>The return to traditional ways of learning might be the answer to questions raised by politicians and experts. They have questioned the country's dependence on electronic technology in education. For example, schools in Sweden have introduced tablets in preschools but critics say students are not learning basic skills as well.</p>
<p>Lotta Edholm is the Swedish Minister for Schools. She took office 11 months ago as part of a new center-right government. She was one of the biggest critics of the level of technology in schools.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Students read at the Djurgardsskolan elementary school in Stockholm, Sweden, Thursday, Aug. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/David Keyton)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-f01d-08dbbde4ba71_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">Students read at the Djurgardsskolan elementary school in Stockholm, Sweden, Thursday, Aug. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/David Keyton)</span></div>
<p>"Sweden's students need more textbooks," Edholm said in March. "Physical books are important for student learning."</p>
<p>The minister announced last month that the government wants to <strong>reverse</strong> the decision made by the National Agency for Education to make digital devices required in preschools. The ministry told the Associated Press that it plans to stop digital learning for children under the age of six<em>.</em></p>
<p>Sweden's students score above the European average for reading ability. But an international test of fourth grade reading levels, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, showed Sweden's children had lost ground between 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>Some learning loss might have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. The losses could also be a result of a growing number of immigrant students who do not speak Swedish as their first language. But an overuse of electronic devices during school lessons may cause kids to fall behind, education experts say.</p>
<p>Sweden's Karolinska Institute is a medical school centered on research.</p>
<p>"There's clear scientific evidence that digital tools <strong>impair</strong> rather than <strong>enhance</strong> student learning," the institute said in a statement last month. The institute added that schools should instead center on teaching using printed <strong>textbooks</strong> and teacher knowledge. Information from digital sources may not be <strong>accurate</strong>, it said.</p>
<p>The expansion of digital learning tools in schools also has drawn concern from the United Nations' education and culture agency.</p>
<p>In a report published last month, UNESCO issued an "urgent call for <strong>appropriate</strong> use of technology in education." The report urged countries to speed up internet connections at schools. But it also warned that technology in education should be used in a way so that it never replaces in-person, teacher-led instruction.</p>
<p>Online instruction is a highly debated subject across Europe and in other parts of the world. Poland, for instance, just launched a program to give a <strong>laptop</strong> paid for by the government to each student starting in fourth grade.</p>
<p>In the United States, the coronavirus pandemic pushed public schools to provide millions of laptops to students. But there is still a digital divide, which is part of the reason why American schools often use both print and digital textbooks, said Sean Ryan. He is president of the U.S. school division at textbook publisher McGraw Hill.</p>
<p>Educators are less likely to use only digital textbooks because some households lack the technology or internet connection at home, he added.</p>
<p>To answer Sweden's decline in 4th grade reading performance, the Swedish government announced $64.7 million in book purchases for the country's schools this year. Another $45.3 million will be spent yearly in 2024 and 2025 to speed up the return of textbooks to schools.</p>
<p>Not all experts think Sweden's move away from digital technology is only about what is best for students.</p>
<p>Criticizing the effects of technology is "a popular move with conservative politicians," Neil Selwyn said. He is a professor of education at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>"The Swedish government does have a <strong>valid</strong> point when saying that there is no evidence for technology improving learning, but I think that's because there is no straightforward evidence of what works with technology," Selwyn added. "Technology is just one part of a really complex network of <strong>factors</strong> in education."</p>

            <title>Biden Joins Striking Autoworkers in Michigan  (2023/9/27)</title>

<p>American President Joe Biden joined members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) on a <strong>picket </strong>line as they continued their strike against U.S. carmakers Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden's action represents the strongest presidential support in history for striking workers.</p>
<p>"You <strong>deserve</strong> the <strong>significant</strong> raise you need," Biden said after arriving at a General Motors parts center west of Detroit, Michigan. He walked along the picket line, exchanging <strong>fist bumps</strong> with striking workers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="U.S. President Joe Biden joins striking United Auto Workers on the picket line, in Van Buren Township, Michigan on Sept. 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c3a36e93-0d38-4ed7-a6de-38dd1fbce287_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">U.S. President Joe Biden joins striking United Auto Workers on the picket line, in Van Buren Township, Michigan on Sept. 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)</span></div>
<p>He said "yes" when asked if UAW members deserved a pay increase, one of the demands that the union has made. "No deal, no wheels!" workers said loudly as Biden arrived. "No pay, no parts!"</p>
<p>Candidates have appeared at strikes to show support for union members. During his 2020 Democratic primary campaign, Biden and others joined a picket line of<strong> casino</strong> workers in Las Vegas, Nevada. But sitting presidents have to balance the rights of workers, businesses and economic concerns. They have long avoided such appearances.</p>
<p>"No president has ever walked a picket line before," said Erik Loomis, a professor at the University of Rhode Island and an expert on U.S. labor history. Loomis added that presidents "saw themselves more as <strong>mediators</strong>. They did not see it as their place to directly intervene in a strike or in labor action."</p>
<p>Biden's action represents the strongest presidential support for striking workers since 1902. In that year, University of Texas historian Jeremi Suri said, President Theodore Roosevelt invited striking coal workers to the White House.</p>
<p>Biden joined the striking workers one day before former President Donald Trump plans another event with auto workers in Detroit. Trump is the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and will likely face Biden in the general election.</p>
<p>The UAW strike against three major American carmakers started 12 days ago on September 14. The UAW targeted General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler and Jeep. Thirteen-thousand auto workers went on strike that day. And another 5,600 joined them last week.</p>
<p>The labor union is asking for fewer working hours, improved <strong>benefits</strong> and a 36 percent raise in pay over four years. The group is also asking for union representation at new electric vehicle <strong>battery</strong> factories.</p>
<p>The group said workers had given up raises for many years to help auto companies through the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. American auto companies also received government support at the time but have since become very profitable. The three companies have received <strong>net income</strong> of $164 billion since and $20 billion this year.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden said "I think the UAW gave up an incredible amount back when the automobile industry was going under. They gave everything from their <strong>pensions</strong> on, and they saved the automobile industry." He added that workers should benefit from carmakers' riches.</p>
<p>Republicans believe Biden's push for electric vehicles (EVs) is unpopular with auto workers. In a statement on Tuesday, Trump accused Biden of "stabbing" autoworkers in the back. Biden's EV push, he said, will hurt the U.S. auto industry and cost jobs.</p>
<p>The auto industry and its labor unions usually play an important part in elections in Michigan and other midwestern states.</p>
<p>In 2016, Trump captured the White House by winning the state of Michigan among others. Biden won Michigan in 2020.</p>

<p>A <strong>capsule</strong> carrying <strong>asteroid</strong> material captured in space three years ago has arrived safely on Earth.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft released the capsule Sunday during a pass by Earth. A parachute floated the capsule down to the surface as it landed in a restricted military area in the Utah desert.</p>
<p>NASA officials said the capsule arrived as planned with no observable damage. Within two hours of landing, it was already inside a temporary clean room belonging to the U.S. Defense Department.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Recovery team members carry a capsule containing NASA's first asteroid samples to a temporary clean room at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah on Sunday, Sept. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-0e9f-08dbbdecbbbc_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Recovery team members carry a capsule containing NASA's first asteroid samples to a temporary clean room at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah on Sunday, Sept. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)</span></div>
<p>The <strong>sealed</strong> container holding the <strong>samples</strong> was being flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. It will then be closely examined in a new, specially designed laboratory.</p>
<p>Dante Lauretta, with the University of Arizona, is the project's lead scientist. He told reporters he got so emotional after the successful sample recovery that he "broke into tears." Lauretta said his team cannot wait to start examining the material. "For me, the real science is just beginning." Lauretta will stay with the samples all the way to Texas.</p>
<p>NASA's planetary science director, Lori Glaze, said she thinks the samples will be a "treasure" for scientific examination "for years and years to come."</p>
<p>Osiris-Rex began its <strong>mission</strong> in 2016. It reached Bennu, about 320 million kilometers from Earth, two years later. The spacecraft completed its asteroid sample operation in October 2020. Its robotic arm touched the asteroid Bennu for a few seconds to produce dust and rock samples for collection.</p>
<p>At the time, scientists said Osiris-Rex had captured much more asteroid material than they had expected. NASA reported in 2020 that some material had spilled out and floated away during the collection process.</p>
<p>Japan is the only other country to bring back asteroid samples from space. Those collection efforts resulted in much less material being captured. The rock and dust samples that arrived Sunday represent the largest space samples reaching Earth besides material returned by NASA in the past from the moon.</p>
<p>Engineers have estimated the capsule holds about 250 grams of material from Bennu. But it will likely take a few weeks to get an exact measurement, said NASA <strong>curator </strong>Nicole Lunning. NASA said it plans to discuss details about the captured samples next month.</p>
<p>Osiris-Rex is already on its way to another asteroid, Apophis, which it is expected to reach in 2029.</p>
<p>Scientists say the asteroid samples contain remains from the building blocks of our early solar system. Researchers say the samples' present-day chemistry and mineral makeup are mostly unchanged since forming about 4.5 billion years ago. This means the samples likely hold valuable data about the early development of rocky planets such as Earth.</p>

<p>Millions of people in the Americas will be in a position to see a solar eclipse on October 14.</p>
<p>Weather permitting, viewers will be able to see the moon as it is passing in front of the sun during the eclipse. The astronomical event can be seen in parts of the United States, Mexico, and several countries in Central America and South America.</p>
<p><strong>What is an annular solar eclipse?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An annular eclipse at a waterfront park in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Shuji Kajiyama)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-ba53-08dbbdc4fa05_cx8_cy9_cw89_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An annular eclipse at a waterfront park in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Monday, May 21, 2012.

<p>A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between Earth and the sun. The moon blocks the view of some or all of the sun's face as it passes in front of the sun.</p>
<p>The one that will happen on October 14 is called an "annular solar eclipse." This happens when the moon passes between Earth and the sun at a time when the moon is at or close to its farthest point from our planet.</p>
<p>Because the moon is farther than usual from Earth during an annular solar eclipse, the moon will not completely cover the sun like a "total eclipse."</p>
<p>It will instead look like a dark circle on top of the sun's larger, bright face in the sky. As a result, the eclipse will momentarily look like a "<strong>ring</strong> of fire" surrounding the dark circle of the moon. A total eclipse will happen on April 8, 2024. It will pass over Mexico, the United States, and Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Where can it be seen?</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. space agency NASA says the path in the United States where the <strong>maximum</strong> amount of sun will be covered runs through several states beginning at 16:13 GMT. It will start in the state of Oregon, and then pass through California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>The path then crosses over parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil before ending at sunset in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>People in much larger parts of North America, Central America, and South America will be able to see less of the sun covered, but it is still something to witness.</p>
<p><strong>What is the safest way to watch an eclipse?</strong></p>
<p>Experts warn that it is unsafe to look directly at the bright sun without using specialized eye protection designed for seeing the sun. Eyes can become damaged when looking at the sun without protection.</p>
<p>Because the sun is never fully blocked by the moon in an annular solar eclipse, it is never safe to look directly at it without such eye protection.</p>
<p>Viewing it through a camera, binoculars, or telescope, without making use of a special <strong>filter</strong> for the sun can cause severe eye injury, experts say.</p>
<p>They advise using safe viewing glasses for the sun or a safe handheld viewer for the sun at all times during an annular solar eclipse. They note that regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the sun.</p>

<p>For many years, preventing dengue fever in Honduras has meant teaching people to avoid mosquito bites. Now, Hondurans are being taught a more effective way to control the disease — and it goes against everything they have learned.</p>
<p>Recently, a small group of people cheered as Hector Enriquez freed mosquitoes from a glass <strong>jar</strong>. Enriquez did that to bring attention to a program to suppress the viral disease dengue fever. He did so by releasing millions of special mosquitoes in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</p>
<p>Scientists <strong>bred</strong> the mosquitoes. The small insects carry bacteria called Wolbachia that stop the spread of the disease. When these mosquitoes reproduce, they pass on the bacteria and reduce future outbreaks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Lourdes Betancourt prepares a jar containing mosquito eggs to hang from a tree in her yard, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Aug. 23, 2023.

<p>The nonprofit World Mosquito Program based in Australia launched the new plan for battling dengue. And it is being tested in more than 10 countries. With more than half the world's population at risk of dengue infection, the World Health Organization is watching the mosquito releases in Honduras and other places closely in order to expand the plan worldwide.</p>
<p>In Honduras, about 10,000 people are known to be sickened by dengue each year. The health organization Doctors Without Borders is partnering with the mosquito program over the next six months to release 9 million mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacteria.</p>
<p>"There is a desperate need for new approaches," said Scott O'Neill, founder of the mosquito program.</p>
<p><strong>Dengue infection rising</strong></p>
<p>Scientists have made progress in recent years to reduce the threat of infectious diseases, including diseases spread by mosquitos, like malaria. But dengue is the exception: Its rate of infection keeps going up.</p>
<p>Public health studies estimate that around 400 million people across about 130 countries get infected each year with dengue. An estimated 40,000 people die each year from it.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of preventing mosquito-<strong>borne</strong> illnesses have not been effective against dengue.</p>
<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that most commonly spread dengue are resistant to <strong>insecticides</strong>. They are most active during the day when people are not protected by bed <strong>nets</strong>. And the dengue virus is harder to control through vaccines.</p>
<p>"We need better tools," said Raman Velayudhan, a researcher from the WHO's Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Program. "Wolbachia is definitely a long-term, sustainable solution."</p>
<p>Velayudhan and other experts from the WHO plan to promote further testing of Wolbachia bacteria in other parts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Wolbachia bacteria</strong></p>
<p>The Wolbachia bacteria exist naturally in about 60 percent of mosquitoes but not in the Aedes aegypti.</p>
<p>About 40 years ago, scientists aimed to use Wolbachia to drive down mosquito populations. Because male mosquitoes carrying the bacteria only produce <strong>offspring</strong> with females that also have it, scientists would release infected male mosquitoes into the wild to breed with uninfected females.</p>
<p>But they made a surprising discovery: Mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia did not spread dengue — or other related diseases, including yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. And since infected females pass on Wolbachia to their offspring, they will eventually "replace" a local mosquito population with one that carries the virus-blocking bacteria.</p>
<p>This involves a change in thinking. Scientists are now replacing mosquitoes instead of killing them.</p>
<p>O'Neill's laboratory first tested the replacement plan in Australia in 2011. The World Mosquito Program has run tests affecting 11 million people across 14 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Fiji and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In 2019, a large field test in Indonesia showed a 76 percent drop in reported dengue cases after Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released.</p>
<p>Scientists are still not sure how Wolbachia bacteria blocks the spread of the virus. And it is not clear whether the bacteria will work equally well against all versions, or strains, of the virus. It also is not clear if some strains might become resistant over time.</p>
<p>Bobby Reiner is a mosquito researcher at the University of Washington. He said, "It's certainly not a <strong>one-and-done</strong> fix, forever guaranteed."</p>
<p><strong>Raising Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes</strong></p>
<p>The World Mosquito Program breeds 30 million mosquitoes a week at a factory in Medellín, Colombia. Once workers confirm that the new mosquitoes are infected with Wolbachia, their eggs are dried and sent off to test areas for release.</p>
<p>The Doctors Without Borders team in Honduras recently went around Tegucigalpa to enlist local help in <strong>incubating</strong> mosquito eggs bred in the Medellin factory.</p>
<p>They received permission to hang glass jars from tree branches that contained water and mosquito eggs. After about 10 days, the mosquitoes would <strong>hatch </strong>and fly off. That same day, workers from Doctors Without Borders released thousands of dengue-fighting mosquitoes into the air.</p>
<p>Some of the most common questions from the community were about whether Wolbachia would harm people or the environment. Workers said that the bites from the special mosquitoes were harmless.</p>
<p>María Fernanda Marín is a 19-year-old student working for Doctors Without Borders. She showed neighbors a photo of her arm covered in bites to help earn their trust.</p>
<p>Lourdes Betancourt is a 63-year-old volunteer with the Doctors Without Borders team. She had been sickened by dengue several times and was not sure about the new plan at first. But Betancourt now urges her neighbors to let the "good mosquitoes" grow in their yards.</p>
<p>"I tell people not to be afraid, that this isn't anything bad, to have trust," Betancourt said. "They are going to bite you, but you won't get dengue."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) said Sunday that it had reached an agreement with Hollywood movie and television studios. The announcement signaled that the group's five-month strike is nearing an end.<br/>
美国编剧协会周日表示，已与好莱坞影视工作室达成协议。这标志着该组织为期五个月的罢工行将结束。</p>
<p>The WGA is the labor group that represents writers in the United States who work on many movies and television programs.<br/>
美国编剧协会是一家劳工组织，它代表着美国从事诸多影视节目的编剧。</p>
<p>The writers' group said its members will not yet return to work, but they will no longer protest – or picket – outside movie studios.<br/>
该编剧团体表示，其成员尚未返回工作岗位，但他们将不再在电影制片厂外抗议。</p>
<p>The WGA said it reached an agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television producers for a tentative three-year deal. It is called "tentative," which means not certain, because it must still be approved by the WGA's leaders and members. A vote could happen this week.<br/>
美国编剧协会表示，它与电影电视制片人联盟达成了一项为期三年的暂定协议。它被称为“暂定”，意思是不确定，因为它仍然必须得到美国编剧协会领导人和成员的批准。投票可能在本周进行。</p>
<p>The WGA said its labor stoppage lasted more than 140 days. If it had gone five days longer, the strike would have been the longest in WGA history.<br/>
美国编剧协会表示，其停工持续了140多天。如果罢工时间再延长五天，这次罢工将是美国编剧协会历史上持续时间最长的一次。</p>
<p>When the new contract is approved, programs that depend on writers who have not been working could be back on television within days. Those include nightly comedy programs such as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live!.<br/>
当新合同获得批准后，那些依赖于罢工编剧的节目可能会在几天内重回屏幕。其中包括每晚的喜剧节目，如吉米·法伦和吉米·金梅尔的《今夜秀》！。</p>
<p>The news made some media experts think the actors' group – known as SAG-AFTRA – could be close to ending its strike.<br/>
这一消息让一些媒体专家认为，美国电影电视演员工会可能即将结束罢工。</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA congratulated the WGA on reaching its agreement. It used words such as "strength, resiliency and solidarity" to describe the writers' group's decision to hold out for a good deal.<br/>
美国电影电视演员工会祝贺美国编剧协会达成协议。它用“力量、韧性和团结”等词来形容编剧团体坚持要求达成协议的决定。</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA added, "We remain committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members." It also said it wants the studio leaders to "return to the table and make a fair deal that our members deserve and demand."<br/>
美国电影电视演员工会补充道，“我们仍然致力于为我们的会员达成必要条款。”它还表示，希望好莱坞影视工作室领导人“回到谈判桌上，做出我们会员应得和要求的公平交易。”</p>
<p>The writers and studio heads made their agreement without intervention from government officials. That has happened in the past.<br/>
编剧和好莱坞影视工作室负责人在没有政府官员干预的情况下达成了协议。这种情况过去也曾发生过。</p>
<p>State and local government leaders congratulated the two groups on their new plan. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was "grateful the two sides have come together."<br/>
州和地方政府领导人对这两个团体的新计划表示祝贺。加州州长加文·纽瑟姆表示，他“很感激双方走到了一起。”</p>
<p>One of the main issues that caused the strike was how writers are paid by streaming video services such as Netflix. Another issue was the use of artificial intelligence technology in the creation of scripts. The strike stopped production on a number of daily television programs and delayed upcoming television shows and movies that had been planned for production.<br/>
导致罢工的主要问题之一是作家如何通过Netflix等流媒体视频服务获得报酬。另一个问题是在脚本创作时使用人工智能技术。这场罢工停止了一些日常电视节目的制作，并推迟了原本计划制作的即将播出的电视节目和电影。</p>
<p>The writers started their strike on May 2. Film and television actors stopped working on July 14. The two groups had not gone on strike at the same time since 1960.<br/>
编剧们于5月2日开始罢工。电影和电视演员于7月14日停止工作。自1960年以来，这两个团体从未同时举行过罢工。</p>

            <title>Study: Drug Could Block Bone Loss in Astronauts in Space  (2023/9/25)</title>

<p>Researchers say a new drug compound has been found to prevent bone loss in humans visiting space.</p>
<p>The drug was tested on mice on the International Space Station (ISS). A new study reports the compound was engineered to help increase the formation of new bone material.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA has long studied the effects of space travel on human health. Astronauts who have spent long periods in space <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/study-long-periods-in-space-can-shrink-the-heart/5838247.html" target="_blank">have taken part in major studies</a> that looked at their health before, during and after their trips, or missions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by NASA shows astronaut Frank Rubio floating inside the cupola, the International Space Station's " ap="" for="" holds="" longest="" now="" record="" rubio="" spaceflight.="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-d6c6-08dbbb7820b6_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" the="" to="" u.s.="" via="" window="" world.=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by NASA shows astronaut Frank Rubio floating inside the cupola, the International Space Station's "window to the world." Rubio now holds the record for the longest U.S. spaceflight. (NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>NASA announced that American astronaut <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/frank-rubio-year-in-space" target="_blank">Frank Rubio</a> recently set the agency's record for the longest single spaceflight by a U.S. astronaut. Rubio, who is set to return to Earth on September 27, has spent 371 days in space. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei set the earlier record in March of 2022 after living in space for 355 days.</p>
<p>Some of the main health problems for humans are related to the gravitational conditions in space. Past studies have shown the low gravity environments in space can greatly reduce or stop the formation of new bone material.</p>
<p>NASA has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/b4h-3rd/hh-preventing-bone-loss-in-space">estimated</a> that astronauts spending more than six months in space can lose between six and 10 percent of bone matter. Some experiments in astronauts measured changes in their upper leg. Development of new bone can take at least three or four years after astronauts return to Earth, NASA says.</p>
<p>The conditions astronauts experience in space can result in bone loss up to 10 times more than is seen in human patients dealing with the bone loss disease osteoporosis, NASA notes.</p>
<p>Currently, physical exercise is the main method astronauts use to reduce bone loss during long periods in space. Generally, crew members aboard the ISS spend about 2.5 hours each day exercising in an effort to reduce the gravitational effects of space.</p>
<p>Past research on the subject has suggested a group of drugs widely used to treat osteoporosis, called bisphosphonates, have shown promise in Earth-based experiments on bone loss. That research continues.</p>
<p>But the new study shows success combining a bisphosphonate with another substance that has shown promise in helping to regrow bone material. That substance is called NELL-1. It was discovered by scientist Kang Ting at the Massachusetts-based Forsyth Institute.</p>
<p>The study was led by a team from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/engineered-compound-shows-promise-preventing-bone-loss-space">In a statement</a>, the research team said the resulting compound, a molecule called BP-NELL-PEG, was given to mice aboard the ISS to test its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The experiments were carried out by astronauts who arrived on the ISS in June 2017. Half the mice remained on the ISS for nine weeks, while the rest were flown back to Earth four-and-a-half weeks after launch. Both sets of mice were given either BP-NELL-PEG or a salt solution containing no medicine.</p>
<p>The researchers reported both sets of mice who were given the BP-NELL-PEG compound showed "a <strong>significant </strong>increase in bone formation" during the experiment period. The team added that neither the mice treated on Earth nor those that received the drug in space experienced any observable side effects.</p>
<p>Chia Soo is with UCLA's School of Medicine and helped lead the research. She said the findings hold great promise for, in her words, "the future of space exploration, particularly for missions involving extended stays in microgravity."</p>
<p>Another member of the team was former UCLA engineering professor Benjamin Wu. He noted that the study could open the door to the same compound being used to treat patients with extreme osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions on Earth.</p>
<p>The scientists are still examining data on the live mice who returned to Earth halfway through the experiment. Researcher Soo said they hope the data "will provide some <strong>insight</strong> on how to help future astronauts recover from longer... space missions."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Australia's government has placed sensors in parts of the Great Barrier Reef in an effort to record water quality.<br/>
澳大利亚政府在大堡礁部分区域安装了传感器以记录水质。</p>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef covers about 344,000 square kilometers of area off Australia's northeast coast. It contains hundreds of islands and thousands of natural structures, known as reefs.<br/>
大堡礁位于澳大利亚东北海岸，面积约344000平方公里。它包含数百个岛屿和数千个珊瑚礁。</p>
<p>The sensors measure levels of sediment and carbon materials flowing from the Fitzroy River into Keppel Bay in Queensland state. The area sits within the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. Such substances can damage sea life.<br/>
这些传感器负责测量从菲茨罗伊河流入昆士兰州吉宝湾的沉积物和碳物质的水平。该地区位于大堡礁的南部。上述物质会破坏海洋生物。</p>
<p>The Australian government agency Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) operates the program. The agency says the effort uses the sensors and satellite data to measure changes in water quality.<br/>
澳大利亚政府机构联邦科学与工业研究组织负责该项目。该机构表示，这项工作利用传感器和卫星数据来测量水质的变化。</p>
<p>Experts say the quality of Australia's coastal and inland waterways is being threatened by warming temperatures, urbanization, deforestation and pollution.<br/>
专家表示，澳大利亚沿海和内陆水道的水质正受到气温升高、城市化、森林砍伐和污染的威胁。</p>
<p>The reef is one of seven test areas of CSIRO's AquaWatch Australia Mission. The research team hopes to establish 15 testing areas by 2026.<br/>
大堡礁是澳大利亚联邦科学与工业研究组织水质监测任务的七个试验区之一。研究小组希望在2026年前建立15个试验区。</p>
<p>Alex Held leads the program. He told VOA that sediments can be harmful to ocean life because they can block sunlight from the seafloor. The lack of sunlight can hurt the growth of sea plants and other organisms. Sediments can also settle on the tops of coral reefs, affecting sea life there as well.<br/>
亚历克斯·赫尔德领导该项目。他告诉美国之音，沉积物可能对海洋生物有害，因为它们会阻挡海底的阳光。缺乏阳光会损害海洋植物和其他生物的生长。沉积物也会沉积在珊瑚礁顶部，影响那里的海洋生物。</p>
<p>Held said the sensors and satellites will be used to measure the effectiveness of programs meant to reduce the flow, or runoff, of river sediment into the sea.<br/>
赫尔德表示，这些传感器和卫星将用于衡量旨在减少河流沉积物流入大海流量项目的有效性。</p>
<p>Held noted that the Australian government already operates a series of programs aimed at reducing the effects of sediments on sea life. These include efforts to keep plants growing along riverbeds and other bodies of water to help keep sediments out.<br/>
赫尔德指出，澳大利亚政府已经实施了一系列旨在减少沉积物对海洋生物影响的计划。这些措施包括努力让植物沿着河床和其他水体生长，以帮助阻挡沉积物。</p>
<p>Environmentalists have warned that the Great Barrier Reef faces a number of threats. These include climate change, pollution and runoff of agricultural products. The reef – which runs about 2,300 kilometers – has been on the United Nations World Heritage List since 1981.<br/>
环保人士警告说，大堡礁面临许多威胁。其中包括气候变化、污染和农产品径流。该珊瑚礁全长约2300公里，自1981年以来一直被列入联合国世界遗产名录。</p>

<p>She said it is not that she does not know how to take care of these houseplants, she just <strong>neglected</strong> them. She added that the plants are among the hardest to keep alive.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This Sept. 18, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a low-maintenance Aloe vera plant in Syosset, NY.

<p>As a result, Damiano chooses houseplants that need the least amount of care for her home. She looks for plants that deal well with too little water, that grow well with limited light, and can be moved around. Also, these sorts of houseplants are best for beginners to grow.</p>
<p>Damiano's spider plant needs only two things: moderate to bright sunlight and <strong>moist</strong> soil. She said she keeps it by a window, and she pours in whatever water she has left over from the night. Some days, she does not water the plant. And the spider plant creates many plants for replanting, even with one or two fertilizer treatments a year.</p>
<p>Another plant, a pothos, is perfectly happy nowhere near a window. It gets the light it needs from a kind of light <strong>bulb </strong>called an LED. She gives the plant a good amount of water each time the soil completely dries out. She said the plant is doing well, with leaves growing halfway to the floor.</p>
<p>Chinese evergreen is a beautiful houseplant that does well in low-light conditions. Damiano said all you need to do is keep the plant's soil lightly moist at all times and fertilize every other month over the winter and every month for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Catching Z's means to sleep. And the ZZ plant, Zamioculcas zamiifolia, requires so little care that you can almost sleep while taking care of it, Damiano said. It does not like a lot of water or bright light. Make sure the soil <strong>drains</strong> well. The plant actually does best in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The cast iron plant is about as resistant as its name sounds. Damiano said it does not even want your attention. Avoid providing too much sunlight. It prefers electric light or light from a north-facing window. Permit the soil to dry out between waterings and fertilize every other month in summer and autumn and just once during the winter.</p>
<p>One houseplant, the aloe plant, can be used for treating burns. When needed, just cut open a leaf and use the watery <strong>gel</strong> from within on an injury. That liquid not only protects burned skin, but also the plant, reducing its dependency on you. Just place it by a window that provides bright, indirect sunlight and water every three weeks, and less often during winter.</p>
<p>Similar plants called succulents share aloe's ability to store water within their leaves. These sorts of plants usually do well inside where conditions are dry and warm. Most also share aloe's lack of requirements, making them a good fit for new, or neglectful, plant parents.</p>

            <title>Why Rural Hospitals in the US Are Closing Maternity Centers  (2023/9/25)</title>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">24 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Alisha Alderson is a 45-year-old woman from rural eastern Oregon. In August, she was pregnant and just a few weeks from having her baby.</p>
<p>But that month, the only hospital <strong>maternity</strong> center near to her closed. She decided to stay with her brother in the city of Boise, Idaho to be close to a hospital.</p>
<p>In the United States, many rural hospitals have been closing <strong>maternity</strong> centers. The centers are areas of the hospital used only for mothers to give birth to their babies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Katie O'Brien holds her son, Bennett, on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2023, in the birthing room where she delivered him in July at the Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn.

<p>Fewer than half of rural hospitals are now believed to have maternity units. That means pregnant women might have to travel long distances to have their babies under hospital supervision in specialized centers.</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press </em>(<em>AP</em>) reports that birth centers are now increasing in the U.S. A midwife is a person who is trained to help women give birth but who is not a doctor. These centers however still need a hospital nearby in case of serious problems.</p>
<p>More than 2 million women of childbearing age live in places that some observers call "maternity care deserts." These are mainly rural areas that do not have hospitals with specialized maternity centers or obstetricians. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in the health of pregnant women.</p>
<p>Some doctors and researchers say that having fewer maternity units makes having babies less safe. A 2019 study of information from 2007 to 2015 said that rural <strong>residents</strong> have a nine percent greater chance of facing life-threatening problems or death from pregnancy and birth "compared with urban residents."</p>
<p>Dr. Eric Scott Palmer specializes in helping babies born early and newborns with high-risk <strong>complications</strong>. He used to serve as a doctor at Henry County Medical Center in rural Tennessee before the hospital ended obstetric care in September 2023.</p>
<p>He said, "Moms have complications everywhere. Babies have complications everywhere."</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for closures</strong></p>
<p>Peiyin Hung is with the University of South Carolina's Rural and Minority Health Research Center. She said that there are several reasons why maternity units are closing.</p>
<p>Hung said there has been a decrease in the number of births in the United States. There are few workers in hospitals. And there are other reasons. For example, health care providers say government health <strong>insurance</strong> for the poor, called Medicaid, does not pay them enough for their services.</p>
<p>The chief of Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tennessee, John Tucker, said that closing the obstetrics, or OB, unit of the hospital was necessary to save the hospital itself.</p>
<p>Tucker said that 70 percent of the births there were covered by Medicaid. That number is above the national average of 42 percent. Tennessee's Medicaid program only pays the hospital $1,700 for each baby born.</p>
<p>Private insurance usually pays more. In the state of Oregon in 2021, the <strong>median</strong> payment to hospitals for a <strong>cesarean section</strong>, or C-section, was $16,000. That is five times more than what Medicaid would provide for the same operation.</p>
<p>Tucker also said there were problems with having the right number of workers. He said when there are fewer births, hospitals lose money because their costs are fixed. "Whether we've got one baby on the floor or three, we still <strong>staff</strong> at the same level because you...have to be prepared for whatever comes in."</p>
<p><strong>A solution for some</strong></p>
<p>Corina Fitch is a midwife at The Farm Midwifery Center in Summertown, Tennessee. It is an independent center where pregnant women can receive maternity care. Fitch measures women's stomachs, takes their blood, listens to fetal heartbeats, and gives nutritional information.</p>
<p>These kinds of centers could be an answer to the lack of maternity care choices in rural areas. Many states are now taking steps to support more independent birth centers. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont signed a law that will <strong>license</strong> these centers letting them provide care for low-risk pregnancies.</p>
<p>A 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said there is a lack of data about independent birth centers. It said researchers do not fully understand the relationship between birth settings and maternal death or complications. That is partly because there are a small number of births at independent centers.</p>
<p>The Farm Midwifery Center reported that fewer than two percent of women decided to get a C-section. Five percent of patients were transported to hospitals in the center's first 40 years. Usually, women give birth at the center or at their homes.</p>
<p>Fitch said, "We always have a backup plan because we know birth is unpredictable and things can come up."</p>
<p>Some doctors told the <em>AP</em> that rural hospitals still need to be part of any answer. They think that state governments need to do more.</p>
<p>This June in Oregon, Baker City hospital announced that it was going to close its maternity center. Oregon politicians got involved.</p>
<p>They suggested temporarily using obstetric nurses from the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. The Corps is a group of military health care workers within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The group usually helps with natural disasters and disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>However, that did not happen. The public health service sent officials who advised establishing an independent birth center among other things.</p>
<p>Alisha Alderson — the woman who had to go to Idaho for pregnancy care — is married to Shane Alderson. He said that rural communities should not have limited health care because of their size or because of the number of people on Medicaid.</p>
<p>Alderson said, "That's not equitable. People can't survive like that."</p>

            <title>Programs Aim to Increase Number of Black Doctors  (2023/9/24)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 September 2023</span><br/>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The American Medical Association (AMA) recently said the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action dealt a "serious blow" to the medical field's goal of increasing the number of Black doctors.</p>
<p>Affirmative action describes the idea that it is good for society to favor people who come from groups thought to have been discriminated against in the past.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the nation's high court ruled it is unlawful for colleges and universities to consider race in choosing students.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Dr. Starling Tolliver, a dermatology resident at Wayne State University, works at Wayne Health in Dearborn, Michigan, on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/ba325e7e-2b9d-438c-90d7-34cbd4accccc_cx15_cy1_cw84_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Dr. Starling Tolliver, a dermatology resident at Wayne State University, works at Wayne Health in Dearborn, Michigan, on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)</span></div>
<p>Because the Supreme Court's decision includes medical schools, the AMA said the ruling will hurt "gains made in the battle against health <strong>inequities</strong>.</p>
<p>Many medical schools used affirmative action ideas to increase the number of Black students. But even with those efforts, a University of California at Los Angeles study in 2021 said the percentage of Black doctors had only increased by four percent from 1900 to 2018.</p>
<p>Experts believe increasing the number of Black doctors could help Black people's health. Right now, only six percent of physicians in the U.S. are Black but 13 percent of the population is Black.</p>
<p><strong>'A crisis of humanity'</strong></p>
<p>A series of reports by the <em>Associated Press</em> (<em>AP</em>) said that Black people do not get taken care of as well as white people starting at birth. The <em>AP </em>reported that patients said doctors ignored or brushed aside their concerns partly because of <strong>bias</strong> and racism within the U.S. medical system.</p>
<p>Uché Blackstock is an emergency doctor in New York City. He wrote a book called <em>Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>He called the low number of Black doctors "a crisis of humanity."</p>
<p>Starling Tolliver is a 30-year-old Black doctor trying to influence people's opinions. She is in her final year of residency – or training – in dermatology. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the skin. She is training at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p>As a girl growing up in the Midwestern city of Akron, Ohio, she felt like her dream of being a doctor was out of reach. She did not often see doctors who looked like her when she went for treatments for a condition that caused her to lose her hair.</p>
<p>She stayed with her goal of becoming a doctor because she made an agreement with two friends. When they were young, they all said they wanted to be doctors, so they could help other Black people.</p>
<p>One of the friends, Charmaine, became a nurse and one, Maria, died as a teenager. Tolliver said Maria's death made her work harder.</p>
<p>"I'm going to continue to go on this path of medicine," Tolliver said. "Not only for myself, but for Maria, and to <strong>potentially</strong> help others in the future from similar backgrounds..."</p>
<p><strong>Minorities less likely to seek care for skin problems</strong></p>
<p>Tolliver's plan of being a skin doctor might be a good way to help Black people. The Association of American Medical Colleges says just 65 of almost 800 applicants for residencies in dermatology were Black in 2020. But many Blacks do not go to dermatologists for treatment.</p>
<p>The AP reports that minority patients are half as likely to see dermatologists when compared to white patients. Also, more Black men die from skin cancer compared to men of other races. That information came from a study published earlier this year in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</em>.</p>
<p>Dr. Ashley Wysong was one of the writers. She said 75 percent of white men survive skin cancer but only 52 percent of Black men do.</p>
<p>She said if there is a difference in results for patients being treated for the same problem, "we have to look at ways that we are falling short."</p>
<p><strong>Efforts to support minorities in dermatology</strong></p>
<p>Some education experts say ending affirmative action might increase interest in medical schools at HBCUs, or historically black colleges and universities. Morehouse College, in Atlanta, receives over 7,000 medical school applications each year for only 115 openings. The medical school's president and CEO is Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice. She said she expects the number of <strong>applicants</strong> to rise at Morehouse and other HBCU medical schools.</p>
<p>Tolliver, the dermatology resident, said financial aid programs that target minority students who are interested in becoming doctors are important. The American Academy of Dermatology has a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.aad.org/member/career/diversity/diversity-pathways">program</a> called Pathways. Its goal is to increase the number of minority dermatology residents from 100 in 2022 to 250 by 2027. The program aims to help young people who are interested in medicine and guide them into dermatology.</p>
<p>It targets high school students and supports them as they go to college and medical school. Some receive financial aid.</p>
<p>Tolliver received financial aid from Ohio State University for her studies, but she also believes Pathways was important for her later training.</p>
<p><strong>Financial aid and mentoring</strong></p>
<p>Azariah Providence is a 17-year-old high school student who lives in the U.S. Virgin Islands. She hopes to be a dermatologist one day. She joined the Pathways program last month. She wants to be a skin doctor so she can help other girls who have skin problems like she did.</p>
<p>She said she never had a chance to talk with and learn from minority college students and doctors before. Providence said it is important for Black people to learn to care for skin because some problems appear differently on Black skin than white skin.</p>
<p>She hopes more people who look like her can get "a correct <strong>diagnosis</strong>...and the correct treatment," from dermatologists.</p>
<p>Adam Friedman is a dermatologist and the leader of the department at George Washington School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. He said updating textbooks is important, but programs such as Pathways are very important.</p>
<p>As Tolliver finishes her training, she said she hopes she can push dermatologists to seek better outcomes – especially for Black women. She said her goal since childhood has been "for Black women to see the beauty of themselves, within themselves."</p>

<p>Now it's time for <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples and notes on usage.</p>
<p>Before we talk about today's idiom, let's talk about words that you will need to know – gilt and gild.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A lily is seen on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in London, Britain, May 23, 2016. (REUTERS/Toby Melville)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/09320000-0a00-0242-0869-08db0a0935ba_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A lily is seen on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in London, Britain, May 23, 2016. (REUTERS/Toby Melville)</span></div>
<p>"Gilt" as a noun is the gold, or something that looks like gold, laid on a surface. It can also be an adjective. "Gild" is a verb. It means to cover with a fine layer of gilt. Sometimes we add gilt to a plain material like wood to make it look better. In fact, entire buildings can be gilded to make them more pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Word experts say American writer Mark Twain created the term "Gilded Age." In the 1873 novel, <em>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today</em>,<em> </em>he and co-writer Charles Dudley Warner made fun of newly rich people. They discussed how these people would cover wood and other objects with a thin <strong>layer</strong> of gold to make them look more costly.</p>
<p>So, when you gild something you could be trying to cover up something <strong>ugly</strong>. But sometimes we may try to improve something that cannot be improved. It is already wonderful just the way it is. And our attempts to make it better can make it worse.</p>
<p>Take for example, a lily. Lilies are beautiful flowers. Like many beautiful things in nature, they do not need any additions to make them more beautiful.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the idiom <u>gild the lily</u>.</p>
<p>If I "gild the lily," I add some unnecessary <strong>decoration </strong>to something already beautiful. The thing I add is <strong>superfluous</strong>. It is not needed.</p>
<p>Imagine if someone added a really bright shiny gold frame to the Mona Lisa painting. The frame is so bright that it is hard to see the smile on the famous woman. That would be <u>gilding the lily</u>.</p>
<p>However, we use this expression to talk about anything, not just artwork or objects. We gild the lily anytime we try to improve something that is already excellent.</p>
<p>For example, my friend has good bone structure and lovely skin. She's just gilding the lily when she wears makeup.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Once I went to a beautiful garden. It had flowers of every height and color. It had a fish pond and was completely lined with beautiful trees and bushes. The garden was beautiful and peaceful. It was perfect. And then the owners built a tall structure in the middle of it. The structure was made almost of entirely of <strong>stained glass</strong>, like church windows. And while it was beautiful, it was truly gilding the lily. When the sun shone through it, you could not see one flower.</p>
<p>Here are some expressions that are similar: To go overboard, to overdo it, or to get carried away. Listen to this example.</p>
<p><em>A: I got carried away with the decorations on the birthday cake. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Yeah, you really went overboard with the <strong>sprinkles</strong>. The cake was so pretty and now I can't even see it!</em></p>
<p>Experts on the website Meriam Webster explain where the expression came from. The website says that "gild the lily" comes from Shakespeare. But the expression has changed over the years. In his play <em>The Life and Death of King John</em> the line is actually "to paint the lily."</p>
<p>Here is the shortened form from that play -- Act 4, Scene 2: "To gild refined gold, to paint the lily / To throw a <strong>perfume</strong> on the violet.... / Is wasteful and <strong>ridiculous</strong> <strong>excess</strong>."</p>
<p>These days we just say "gild the lily."</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Herbert Hoover. He took office in 1929.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Herbert Hoover" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1b6d12d8-ba04-4363-b77e-28046d51100f_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Herbert Hoover</span></div>
<p>Hoover was president for the early years of what Americans call the Great Depression. During those years, the United States economy slid into a severe recession.</p>
<p>Many banks and businesses failed. At times, nearly one in four people in the U.S. workforce were unemployed. Millions of people lost their homes and savings.</p>
<p>Hoover did not cause the depression. The conditions had been in place before he took office.</p>
<p>But many Americans blamed Hoover for their suffering. They believed he permitted the economic crisis to continue – and even deepen – during his time in office.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Herbert Hoover was born in a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nps.gov/heho/index.htm">small house</a> in the state of Iowa. His parents were Quakers. Their religion valued simplicity, hard work, equality among people, and peaceful resolution of conflict.</p>
<p>Hoover and his brother and sister were influenced by these beliefs, even after their parents died.</p>
<p>By the time young Herbert Hoover was nine, he was an <strong>orphan</strong>. He moved to the state of Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest, and lived with an uncle.</p>
<p>Hoover did not <strong>thrive</strong> in that situation. Reports say that he usually kept to himself. And he did not do particularly well in school.</p>
<p>Yet one official from Stanford University liked what he saw in the young man – hard work and a desire to learn new things. At the time, Stanford University was just getting established. It admitted Hoover into its first class.</p>
<p>Hoover had to work hard at Stanford, both in class and to earn money to pay tuition. But the experience brought many <strong>benefits</strong>.</p>
<p>Hoover studied geology, and went on to work as a mining engineer. The job led to positions in Australia, China and other parts of the world. He became an internationally-known expert on mining. He also wrote a leading textbook on mining.</p>
<p>These experiences, along with good business investments, led to great wealth for Hoover.</p>
<p>At Stanford, he also met the woman who would become his wife. Her name was Lou Henry. She was the <a class="wsw__a" href="http://125.stanford.edu/early-stanford-women/">first woman from Stanford</a> to complete a study program with a degree in geology.</p>
<p>The Hoovers went on to have two sons.</p>
<p><strong>Humanitarian work</strong></p>
<p>During World War I, the Hoovers' lives changed dramatically. The family was living in London when the war began. U.S. government officials asked Hoover to organize an evacuation effort for American tourists who were in Europe. In only a few weeks, Hoover's committee succeeded.</p>
<p>Later, he helped get food and supplies to people in Belgium.</p>
<p>As a result, Hoover earned a public image as a smart, skilled humanitarian.</p>
<p>When the United States entered World War I, President Woodrow Wilson asked Hoover to lead the government's Food Administration.</p>
<p>In that position, Hoover led an effort to change Americans' behavior in order to support the war effort. He asked them to limit the kinds of food they ate and goods they bought.</p>
<p>The effort was, for the most part, successful. Americans called their moves to limit their <strong>consumption</strong> "to Hooverize."</p>
<p>Hoover went on to organize programs to aid other countries, including Russia. He also helped parts of the U.S. recover after terrible flooding.</p>
<p>And, as secretary of commerce, he pushed businesses, researchers, and government officials to work together. Hoover aimed to reduce "<strong>boom and bust</strong>" cycles and keep the U.S. economy healthy.</p>
<p>In all his efforts, Hoover urged Americans to choose to participate. He did not believe in using government requirements to force cooperation.</p>
<p>Instead, he supported "<a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.hooverpress.org/American-Individualism-P635.aspx">individualism</a>" – the idea that Americans must protect the qualities of creativity, equal <strong>opportunity</strong>, and service to others.</p>
<p>Hoover's beliefs were popular with many Americans at the time – and with many Americans today.</p>
<p>In the election of 1928, Hoover easily won the presidency. He promised to continue leading the country down the path of <strong>prosperity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>When Hoover took office in 1929, he <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/hoover-delivers-presidential-inaugural-address-march-4-1929-219984">said</a>, "I have no fears for the future of our country. It is bright with hope."</p>
<p>That was in March.</p>
<p>In October, <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/topics/1929-stock-market-crash">the U.S. stock market crashed</a>. Thousands of investors lost their savings.</p>
<p>The event was part of a sharp downturn in the economies of the United States and of many other countries.</p>
<p>At first, Hoover believed the downturn would pass. But as time went on, the situation grew worse. Businesses could not expand their workforce. Farmers could not afford to harvest their crops. Everyday people had too little money to pay for housing costs and, in some cases, food. And then banks across the country began to fail.</p>
<p>President Hoover worked hard to fix the problems. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933">tried many approaches</a>: creating government agencies, urging private and public groups to cooperate, and working to balance the federal budget.</p>
<p>But Hoover did not want to use federal money to provide direct aid to Americans. He worried that such actions would make people dependent on the government, and reduce people's individual power and <strong>morale</strong>.</p>
<p>Nor did he want to use the federal government to try to control the economy. Government intervention, he said, would lead to socialism, and eventually destroy the country's founding beliefs.</p>
<p>Instead, Hoover tried to support states and businesses indirectly and urged people to find ways to help one another.</p>
<p>Yet many lawmakers and members of the public rejected Hoover's measures as <strong>insufficient</strong>, and even cruel.</p>
<p>Some used his name differently than they had before he took office. Now, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://millercenter.org/president/hoover/campaigns-and-elections">they called</a> the dirty shelters where hungry and homeless people lived "Hoovervilles."</p>
<p>And they called men's empty pockets "Hoover flags."</p>
<p>Although Hoover tried to persuade Americans that he was protecting their interests in the long run, voters refused to elect him for a second term.</p>
<p>Instead, they overwhelming chose a president who promised an activist federal government and a hopeful "new deal" for Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>After they left the White House, the Hoovers retired to their home in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>Lou Henry Hoover died in 1944. But Hoover lived 20 more years, many of them working for the public good. He helped international relief efforts, advised the U.S. government, and led committees to reform the presidency.</p>
<p>Hoover also commented on later presidents and their policy decisions. He was especially critical of government programs set up to provide aid and intervention in Americans' lives.</p>
<p>Until his death from cancer at the age of 90, Hoover remained committed to his beliefs. He spoke for limiting the power of the federal government and for supporting freedom of opportunity for individuals.</p>
<p>But in the eyes of many Americans, Hoover is linked to the failure of the federal government to lessen the Great Depression.</p>

            <title>Flying Taxis to be Made in Ohio, Home of Wright Brothers  (2023/9/23) | 空中的士将在莱特兄弟故乡量产</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202309/flying-taxis-to-be-made-in-ohio-home-of-wright-brothers.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The same area where the Wright brothers developed the first airplane will soon see electric planes that take off and land vertically.<br/>
在莱特兄弟发明第一架飞机的同一片土地上，很快将能看到电动飞机垂直起降。</p>
<p>The planes, called "flying taxis" will be produced under an agreement between the state of Ohio and Joby Aviation at Dayton International Airport.<br/>
这些被称为“空中的士”的飞机将根据俄亥俄州和乔比航空公司在代顿国际机场达成的协议被生产出来。</p>
<p>Ohio Governor Mike DeWine told The Associated Press, "When you're talking about air taxis, that's the future."<br/>
俄亥俄州州长麦克·德温告诉美联社：“说起空中的士，这就是未来。”</p>
<p>Around the world, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, or flying taxis, are becoming more common. Still, questions remain about noise levels and charging demands.<br/>
在世界各地，电动垂直起降飞机或空中的士正变得越来越普遍。尽管如此，噪音水平和充电需求仍然存在疑问。</p>
<p>Developers say the planes are nearing the day when they will provide a way to move individual people or small groups from the top of buildings and parking spaces to their destinations.<br/>
开发商表示，这些飞机即将提供一种将个人或少部分人从建筑物顶部和停车场地运送到目的地的方式。</p>
<p>The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived and worked in Dayton, Ohio. In 1910, they opened the first U.S. airplane factory there. To connect with this history, Joby's official announcement Monday took place at Orville Wright's home, Hawthorn Hill, and ended with a special flight of a copy of the Wright Model B Flyer.<br/>
莱特兄弟奥维尔和威尔伯在俄亥俄州代顿生活和工作。1910年，他们在那里开设了第一家美国飞机工厂。为了与这段历史联系起来，乔比航空周一在奥维尔·莱特位于霍索恩山的故居正式宣布了这一消息，并以一架莱特B型飞行者飞机的特别飞行结束。</p>
<p>Engineers designed Joby's production aircraft to transport a pilot and four passengers at speeds of up to 321.87 kilometers per hour. The aircraft can cover a distance of up to 160.93 kilometers. It is a quiet machine that can barely be heard in most cities, the company said. The plan is to place them in aerial ridesharing networks beginning in 2025.<br/>
工程师们设计了乔比航空的量产飞机，它以每小时321.87公里的速度运送一名飞行员和四名乘客。这架飞机的飞行距离可达160.93公里。该公司表示，这是一台安静的机器，在大多数城市几乎听不到它的噪音。该公司计划从2025年开始将它们纳入空中的士网络。</p>
<p>Joby Aviation is a 14-year-old company that went public in 2021 and became the first eVTOL firm to receive a special kind of permission, or certification, from the U.S. Air Force. Its production efforts are supported by partnerships with Toyota, Delta Air Lines, Intel and Uber.<br/>
乔比航空是一家成立14年的公司，它于2021年上市，并成为第一家获得美国空军特别认证的电动垂直起降飞机公司。它的生产工作得到了与丰田、达美航空、英特尔和优步合作的支持。</p>
<p>The $500 million project is supported by up to $325 million in payments from the state of Ohio. With the money, Joby plans to build an Ohio facility capable of delivering up to 500 aircraft a year and creating 2,000 jobs. The U.S. Department of Energy has invited Joby to apply for a loan to support development of the facility as a clean energy project.<br/>
这个价值5亿美元的项目得到了俄亥俄州高达3.25亿美元的资金支持。有了这笔钱，乔比航空计划在俄亥俄州建造一座工厂，每年可交付500架飞机，并创造2000个就业机会。美国能源部已邀请乔比航空申请贷款，以支持该设施作为清洁能源项目的开发。</p>
<p>Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt told the AP that the company chose Ohio after a large and competitive search. Ohio's financial deal was not the largest, but the chance to bring the operation to the birthplace of aviation — with a workforce experienced in the field — led to the deal, he said.<br/>
乔比航空首席执行官乔本·贝维特告诉美联社，该公司在进行了大规模竞争性的搜索后选择了俄亥俄州。他说，俄亥俄州的金融交易并不是最大的，但有机会将业务带到航空业的发源地，以及拥有该领域经验丰富的员工，这些优势最终促成了这笔交易。</p>
<p>The announcement comes as a group of Ohio's congressional representatives has recently increased efforts to draw the U.S. Air Force's new U.S. Space Command headquarters or Space Force units to Ohio. There, too, state leaders point to the history of the Wrights, as well as Ohio-born astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong.<br/>
俄亥俄州的一群国会代表最近加大了将美国空军新的美国太空司令部总部或太空军部队吸引到俄亥俄州的力度。州领导人也提到了莱特兄弟的历史，以及俄亥俄州出生的宇航员约翰·格伦和尼尔·阿姆斯特朗。</p>

<span class="byline">By Gena Bennett</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">22 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Artwork has been a part of federal structures almost since the founding of the United States.</p>
<p>A good example is the U.S. Capitol Building with its <strong>domed</strong> <strong>ceiling</strong>, paintings and statues. And the Washington Monument to honor the nation's first president was completed in 1888.</p>
<p>Jennifer Gibson is the director of the Center for Fine Arts at the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency that supervises federal buildings. She says art in federal buildings is a record of the past and "creates a <strong>dynamic</strong> presence in towns and cities and border stations across the country."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="For US, Art in Federal Buildings Is a Must" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a685-08dbb08b118d_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">For US, Art in Federal Buildings Is a Must</span></div>
<p>In the 1960s, a presidential committee stated that "...fine art should be <strong>incorporated</strong> into the designs of federal buildings with emphasis on the work of living American artists."</p>
<p>Today, the government still spends about 0.5 percent of the federal budget to commission, or order, new artwork for federal spaces.</p>
<p>The commissions are decided by a group that includes the lead designer of the building, those who will occupy the space, community members, arts professionals, and the GSA. Artists are given details about the building project and asked to propose artwork they think is best for the space.</p>
<p>New York artist James Carpenter created two artworks for federal buildings. They included a ceiling for a courtroom in Phoenix, Arizona, and a <strong>sculpture</strong> for another courthouse in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Carpenter said, "My work is really about how to <strong>enhance</strong> or influence, in a very positive way, people's experience of spaces..."</p>
<p>For some artists, requests to provide art for federal buildings may not be related to making money. Artists can make commissions as much as $1 million from non-government artworks. The average commission for art in federal buildings is around $100,000. And the process can take several years, limiting an artist's ability to work on other art projects. Carpenter said the Salt Lake City project took a total of 12 years.</p>
<p>"They're looking at it as a way to <strong>participate</strong> in what's going on in the nation and to be part of its history," Gibson says. "This is for the nation. This is permanent. We will take care of it. And it's your way to participate."</p>
<p>The commissioned artworks can be found in 428 federal buildings across the country. Overall, the GSA's fine art collection contains 26,712 works, including some that date back to the 1850s.</p>
<p>Most of the artworks are paintings, <strong>sculptures</strong> and<strong> photographs </strong>created in the 1930s. That was the time the government employed artists during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The collection belongs to the American people as a record of the history of American culture.</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "in time" and "on time?"</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Dear VOA,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-8322-08dbba1f71d9_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>What is the difference between "in time" and "on time?" I appreciate that you can help me understand them. I'm looking forward to seeing your answer.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Nguyen</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for this great question, Nguyen! Both "on time" and "in time" have to do with being <strong>punctual</strong> and deadlines. Sometimes people use these expressions interchangeably, but they are different. And "in time" has a few more uses.</p>
<p>Let's look at each one.</p>
<p><strong>On time</strong></p>
<p>"On time" is an expression that includes a preposition (on) and a noun (time). If something is "on time" it arrives at or by an exact time or deadline. It is not late. You can think of "on time" as when something happens. And if it happens at that exact time, then it is "on time."</p>
<p><em>Jordan did not submit her homework on time, so she received 5 points off. </em></p>
<p><em>The train is always on time so I am never late to work. </em></p>
<p>Let's move onto "in time."</p>
<p><strong>In time</strong></p>
<p>"In time" is also an expression that includes a preposition (in) and the noun "time." Like "on time," it is used to talk about deadlines and times.</p>
<p>It means early enough or not too late for something to happen. Often, we use it to talk about something in relation to another event or thing using another preposition "for" after the expression.</p>
<p><em>Even though my train was late, I got to work in time for the meeting. </em></p>
<p><em>We made it home in time to watch our favorite show. </em></p>
<p>"In time" is also used two other ways.</p>
<p>In music, "in time" means to keep a <strong>rhythm</strong> or speed.</p>
<p><em>The tap dancer was able to keep time with the musicians. </em></p>
<p> </p>

            <title>Saudi Arabia Aims to Meet Water Needs with Solar Power  (2023/9/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Saudi Arabia is a dry place. In many areas, people there depend on turning saltwater from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea into drinkable, fresh water. That process is called <strong>desalination</strong>.</p>
<p>Desalination centers supply drinking water to cities and towns in the kingdom. However, observers say the process of desalination is not good for the environment because it mostly uses oil and gas.</p>
<p>One goal of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is to make Saudia Arabia a leader in business and <strong>tourism</strong>. For this, the country must meet growing demands for water.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Asian laborers of the Saudi National Water Company working at a construction site in a road in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. (Fayez Nureldine / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4e5d-08dbb781444e_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Asian laborers of the Saudi National Water Company working at a construction site in a road in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. (Fayez Nureldine / AFP)</span></div>
<p>But Saudi Arabia's environmental goal is to reach <strong>net-zero emissions</strong> by 2060. So, the country's leaders say they want to reduce the amount of carbon gases produced. Some people say carbon gases are warming the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>A desalination plant in the eastern part of the country uses <strong>solar panels</strong>. The Jazlah plant is the first in Saudi Arabia to use solar power for desalination on a large <strong>scale</strong>. Officials said the panels will help save 60,000 tons of carbon emissions each year.</p>
<p>More projects like Jazlah are needed because Prince Mohammed has another goal. He wants to increase the population to 100 million people by 2040. The country's current population is about 32.2 million.</p>
<p>Marco Arcelli is chief of ACWA Power, the company that operates the Jazlah plant. He said, usually "the population grows, and then the quality of life of the population grows." That means more water will be needed in the future.</p>
<p>Using desalination is a "do or die" issue, said historian Michael Christopher Low. He has studied the kingdom's struggle with water at the University of Utah in the United States. Low said this issue is a matter of survival for Saudia Arabia. At the same time, he added, "there are limits" to how desalination can be done so that it does not affect the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Current use of fossil fuels</strong></p>
<p>The Saline Water Conversion Corporation (or SWCC) is a government company that operates desalination and power plants in Saudi Arabia. The company says it produces 11.5 million cubic meters each day at 30 centers. But growth has come at a cost, especially at centers that use oil or gas.</p>
<p>The AFP press agency reports that, by 2010, Saudi desalination plants were using 1.5 million <strong>barrels</strong> of oil per day. That is more than 15 percent of today's production.</p>
<p>The SWCC said it wants to cut 37 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2025. The company hopes to do this by moving away from plants that use heat to separate water from salt to plants like Jazlah that use solar electricity-powered systems.</p>
<p>The SWCC said in its latest report that solar power is expected to expand to 770 megawatts compared to 120 megawatts today. But how long that will take is unclear.</p>
<p>In the future, there is little doubt Saudi Arabia will be able to build the systems required to produce the water it needs.</p>
<p>"They have already done it in some of the most <strong>challenging</strong> settings, like massively desalinating on the Red Sea and providing desalinated water up to the highlands of the holy cities in Mecca and Medina," said Laurent Lambert. He is with the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>At desalination plants across the kingdom, Saudi employees understand how important their work is.</p>
<p>The Ras Al-Khair center produces 1.1 million cubic meters of water per day with 740,000 from heat technology and the rest from another process. The plant struggles to make enough fresh water because of high demand.</p>
<p>Much of the water goes to Riyadh. That city requires 1.6 million cubic meters per day. It could require as much as 6 million cubic meters a day by 2030, said one employee who was not permitted to talk to the media and remains unidentified.</p>
<p><strong>A short history of Saudi desalination</strong></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia first turned to desalination more than 100 years ago. During the rule of the Ottoman Empire, administrators used <strong>filtration</strong> machines for Muslim travelers observing the Hajj who had to deal with a lack of water and cholera.</p>
<p>Drinking water has been a problem for Saudi Arabia since its founding in 1932. This led to geological studies that also helped identify the country's huge supplies of oil and gas. Leaders since have supervised the birth of the kingdom's modern desalination systems beginning in 1970.</p>

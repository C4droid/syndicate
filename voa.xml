        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">08 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>India has proposed an alliance to speed up the development of biofuels to support energy <strong>transition</strong> worldwide.</p>
<p>Biofuel is a kind of fuel produced from agricultural products or organic waste.</p>
<p>India plans to announce the alliance at the G-20 gathering in New Delhi. It is expected that more than 15 countries will sign up to be part of the alliance. The United States, Canada, and Brazil are among a few of the countries expected to join India in such an alliance.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Sprawling fields of sugar cane are visible near Meerut, India, on August, 30, 2023.

<p><strong>What are biofuels?</strong></p>
<p>Humans have used biofuels since ancient times. For example, humans burn wood and animal waste for cooking, heating, and light. They have gained popularity in recent years for their possibility to deliver cleaner energy than some other sources.</p>
<p>Biofuels are grouped based on their source. Each group is known as a "generation." First-generation biofuels come from food crops like corn and sugar cane. Second generation come from non-food crops and agricultural waste. And third-generation come from small plants called algae.</p>
<p>Ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas are popular kinds of biofuels. They can be produced from any of these sources and are grouped based on the source from which they are produced. For example, ethanol produced from farm-grown corn is grouped as first-generation ethanol.</p>
<p><strong>Are biofuels always a source of clean energy?</strong></p>
<p>Biofuels are not always a clean source of energy. But it depends on how it is produced. A biofuel made from waste, for example, with <strong>renewable</strong> energy to power the production, would have little or no <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> production, making it a clean fuel. But when crops are grown to just produce biofuels, the fertilizer and nonrenewable fuels needed to produce the fuel make it much less clean.</p>
<p>"If you look at the full life <strong>cycle</strong> of producing biofuels, it's many times not clean," said Lydia Powell. She is an energy policy researcher at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. She has followed developments related to biofuels for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Biofuels can also mean land that could have produced food is being used for energy. They can add to deforestation when land is cleared for their production.</p>
<p>Powell noted Europe's imports of plant-based palm oil from Indonesia and other East Asian countries to make biodiesel for cars and trucks. Those imports greatly fell after the European Union banned the sale of palm oil and other palm-based products when they could be linked to deforestation.</p>
<p>"They were destroying natural forests to plant palm trees so you produce oil to export to Europe. When you destroy forests, you destroy large <strong>chunks</strong> of carbon sinks," Powell said.</p>
<p>Those problems have led to debates about exactly how sustainable biofuels are.</p>
<p><strong>What are biofuels used for?</strong></p>
<p>Biofuels are often used for transportation of people and products.</p>
<p>Experts say once they are made, biofuels produce little to no greenhouse gases when used. The same cannot be said with the <strong>fossil fuels</strong> they are mixed with.</p>
<p>But there is a hope that biofuels might completely replace fossil fuels to power airplanes and ships.</p>
<p>"They are one<strong> option </strong>among a larger set of solutions," said Jane O'Malley of International Council on Clean Transportation, a Washington-based independent nonprofit.</p>
<p>O'Malley said it is important to use the right kind of biofuel for the right purpose. She said it is important for countries using biofuels to move as quickly as possible to produce them with little to no greenhouse gas production.</p>

<p>
The Rolling Stones said this week that their first new collection of songs in almost 20 years comes out on October 20.</p>
<p>The album will be called <em>Hackney Diamonds</em>. The name comes from broken glass often seen on the streets of east London's Hackney area.</p>
<p>Three of the band's <strong>original</strong> members - Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood – came to the Hackney Empire, a historic theater, for the announcement.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rolling Stones band members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood attend a launch event for their new album Hackney Diamonds, at Hackney Empire in London, Britain, September 6, 2023.

(REUTERS/Toby Melville)</span></div>
<p>The Rolling Stones are still traveling the world and performing concerts, but they have not made an album since 2016. That recording did not include new material.</p>
<p>Richards, 79, said the band only made a new album because Jagger wanted to sing. So they went to record new songs after almost 20 years.</p>
<p>"When you have a singer that wants to sing," Richards said, "you <strong>grab</strong> him and throw him in the studio." Richards said the songs came together with "energy and urgency."</p>
<p>Jagger, who is 80, said, "we are quite pleased," with the new album. He said the group would not have put a recording together if "we hadn't really liked it. We said we had to make a record we really love ourselves ... we hope you all like it."</p>
<p>They released the first song, called <em>Angry</em>, this week. But Jagger said the rest of the songs are not angry. He said the album contains "love songs, <strong>ballads</strong>, country..." sounds.</p>
<p>The new recording includes songs with Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder and Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones <strong>drummer</strong> who died in 2021. Watts recorded sounds for two songs in 2019. Steve Jordan is the drummer for the other 10.</p>
<p>"Of course, he's missed incredibly," Richards said about Watts. But he added that Jordan was Watts' suggestion for a <strong>replacement</strong>.</p>
<p>Jagger said the addition of Lady Gaga to the album was unplanned. The Stones were recording at a <strong>studio</strong> in Los Angeles and Lady Gaga just happened to be in the studio next door. So, she recorded the song <em>Sweet Sound of Heaven</em> with the band.</p>
<p>"She walked in next to me and we started singing together," Jagger said.</p>
<p>Wood said McCartney of the Beatles played the bass guitar on one <strong>track</strong>. "You know, he was loving it." McCartney's band was perhaps the Rolling Stones' biggest <strong>rival</strong> in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Taric Fioravanti was one of the fans who lined up outside hoping to see the band arrive. He is from Brazil. "I love these guys," he said. "They're 80 years old. Most bands have stopped making music by that age," he added.</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones started in 1962. They celebrated their 60th year with a tour of Europe in 2022 and they said they have plans to visit North America in 2024.</p>
<p>Wood, 76, plays guitar. He said the idea of retirement is "Impossible. You've got to keep playing," he added.</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">08 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "mandatory," "compulsory," and "obligatory."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello. My name is Nelson, and I'm from Nicaragua.<br/>
Can you help me to understand the difference between "compulsory," "mandatory" and "obligatory?"<br/>
Thank you in advance,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mandatory, Compulsory, and Obligatory " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a5ad-08dbae4c5d99_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Mandatory, Compulsory, and Obligatory </span></div>
<p>Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>This is a great question, Nelson. These three adjectives have the same meaning, so they are synonyms. They share a basic definition of "required." But there are some slight differences in how often we use each. Let's start with the most common, "mandatory."</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory</strong></p>
<p>Mandatory comes from the word "mandate," which means to give <strong>authority</strong> to act or as a noun means an official order. Something that is "mandatory" is the result of that action or order. It usually comes from a law or rule.</p>
<p>This is the most common of the three words in question because it is often used in everyday conversations. We use it to describe something that is required by a mandate, law, or rule.</p>
<p><em>In most public high schools, there is mandatory testing every year.</em></p>
<p><em>Seatbelts are mandatory in the U.S. If you do not wear a seatbelt, you are breaking the law. </em></p>
<p><strong>Compulsory</strong></p>
<p>"Compulsory" is the second most common adjective out of the three, so it is used less often than "mandatory. It also means required by law. We often use it to describe education and military service.</p>
<p><em>Many countries in the world have compulsory military service like Ukraine, South Korea, and Egypt. </em></p>
<p><em>Massachusetts became the first place in the United States to have compulsory schooling for children in the year 1642.</em></p>
<p><strong>Obligatory </strong></p>
<p>The least common adjective is "obligatory," but it is the most formal of the three. It means the same as "mandatory" and "compulsory," but also has other meanings.</p>
<p>We use "obligatory" not just for laws or rules, but we use it to describe <strong>obligations </strong>that are based on moral or social instances.</p>
<p><em>Social media is now the obligatory way to message friends because young people do not like to talk on the phone. </em></p>
<p>Another way we use obligatory is when we are talking about something that people have stereotypically used but is not really needed.</p>
<p><em>Many movies for young people feature obligatory dance<strong> </strong>scenes at the end of the film. </em></p>
<p><em>The obligatory two-week notice before you quit your job is common in the U.S. but not required by law. </em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Nelson.</p>

<p>A small recording room outside the Congolese capital Kinshasa has become a safe space for homeless <strong>teenagers</strong>. They sing about their life on the streets and dream of a better future.</p>
<p>The homeless sing about sexual abuse, stealing, theft, and dealings with the police at the Mokili Na Poche cultural center. It is a safe space that permits young people and children to wash, eat, and learn.</p>
<p>"It really makes me happy when I sing," said 19-year-old Osé Mavakala. He has slept on the streets for years. There are more than 20,000 homeless children in Kinshasa, UNICEF, the U.N. agency, has found.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cedrick Tshimbalanga, 32, the founder of Mokili Na Poche cultural centre, uses his phone while talking to homeless teenagers during a lunch at the cultural center in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo September 5, 2023.

<p>Other teenagers looked on with<strong> </strong>happiness as Mavakala <strong>rapped</strong> into the recording equipment at the center in late August.</p>
<p>Mavakala dreams of bigger goals after having the chance to record in a real recording space. He said, "It <strong>encourages</strong> me and I tell myself - ah, life belongs to the <strong>courageous</strong>." He added that U.S. rapper Lil Wayne and Congolese star Fally Ipupa influenced his music.</p>
<p>He has been coming to the center for the past three years, taking part in the music, art, and reading classes it offers throughout the day. Founder Cedrick Tshimbalanga hopes these skills and daily experiences will help the children build a base for their life and their voices.</p>
<p>"With music...young people are able to talk about their daily experience - everything they live through daily: rape, theft, <strong>trauma</strong>, attacks," said Tshimbalanga, who plans to release their music soon.</p>
<p>The classes are also a chance for young people to make up for lost possibilities in life. While the Democratic Republic of Congo has made progress in education, over 7 million children aged between five and 17 still do not have schooling, UNICEF found.</p>
<p>"Break free from the criminal life, my friend, it's time to see what the future holds for you," Mavakala rapped during an emotion-filled performance at the center in August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The U.S. Department of State says that nearly 90,000 Afghans have come to the United States through a special federal program since 2021. The program is called Operation Allies Welcome.<br/>
美国国务院表示，自2021年以来，已有近9万名阿富汗人通过一项特殊的联邦计划来到美国。该项目名为“欢迎盟友行动”。</p>
<p>The U.S. government created Operation Allies Welcome to help resettle Afghans who had worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan until it withdrew.<br/>
美国政府创建了“欢迎盟友行动”项目，以帮助重新安置在美国撤军前曾在阿富汗与美国合作的阿富汗人。</p>
<p>Farzana Jamalzada fled Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of the country in August 2021. Jamalzada feared that her work with the U.S. government put her in danger.<br/>
2021年8月塔利班控制阿富汗后，法扎娜·贾马尔扎达逃离了该国。贾马尔扎达担心她与美国政府的合作会将她置于危险之中。</p>
<p>Jamalzada settled in New York City. The government program gave her permission to live and work in the U.S. for two years. She got a job with an organization that helps people in need, a charity. The job provided her with money to pay for a place to live and other necessities. But the two years ended at the end of August.<br/>
贾马尔扎达在纽约市定居。该政府项目允许她在美国生活和工作两年。她在一家帮助有需要的人的慈善机构找到了一份工作。这份工作为她提供了钱来支付房租和其他必需品。但到8月底这两年时间就结束了。</p>
<p>She and her family are waiting for an immigration interview for their application to live and work in the U.S. permanently. The document that permits this is known as a green card.<br/>
她和她的家人正在等待移民面试，以申请在美国永久生活和工作。这种许可文件被称为绿卡。</p>
<p>Reuters news agency reported that President Joe Biden's administration extended the permission for two more years in June. But the permission to stay in the country is still temporary.<br/>
路透社报道称，拜登政府于6月将该许可延长了两年。但是，留在该国的许可仍然是暂时的。</p>
<p>Difficulty with immigration documents is common for many Afghans who were resettled through Operation Allies Welcome. Their path to legally living in the U.S. permanently is not simple.<br/>
对于许多通过“欢迎盟友行动”重新安置的阿富汗人来说，通常很难获取这份移民文件。他们在美国合法永居的道路并不平坦。</p>
<p>A group of U.S. lawmakers from both political parties, men and women who served in the U.S. military and others are working to support a new law to help Afghan immigrants.<br/>
一群来自两党的美国议员，包括美国服役人员以及其他人员，正在努力支持一项帮助阿富汗移民的新法律。</p>
<p>The Afghan Adjustment Act aims to create a direct path for Afghans to live and work in the U.S. permanently. The goal would be for many Afghans to become citizens in the future.<br/>
《阿富汗调整法案》旨在为阿富汗人在美国永久生活和工作创造一条直接途径。目标是让众多阿富汗人在未来成为公民。</p>
<p>But the legislation has not made progress in the House of Representatives or in the Senate.<br/>
但这项立法在众议院和参议院都没有取得进展。</p>
<p>Danilo Zak is with Church World Service, a group that assists refugees. Zak said there are many Afghans who simply do not have money for, or cannot find, immigration assistance.<br/>
达尼洛·扎克是帮助难民的世界教会服务组织的成员。扎克说，许多阿富汗人根本没有钱或找不到移民援助。</p>
<p>Unlike some others, Jamalzada and her husband do have a path to a green card. They can request a Special Immigrant Visa. The Special Immigrant Visa is for translators, interpreters and others who assisted the U.S. government in the war in Afghanistan.<br/>
与其他人不同，贾马尔扎达和她的丈夫确实有获得绿卡的途径。他们可以申请特殊移民签证。特殊移民签证适用于在阿富汗战争中协助美国政府的翻译、口译员和其他人员。</p>
<p>But Jamalzada had to flee Afghanistan so suddenly that her visa was not fully processed. To get a green card, Jamalzada and her husband must attend a government interview on September 12. Until that time, she and her husband may not legally work.<br/>
但贾马尔扎达不得不突然逃离阿富汗，她的签证没有得到完全处理。为了获得绿卡，贾马尔扎达和她的丈夫必须在9月12日参加政府面试。在此之前，她和丈夫可能无法合法工作。</p>
<p>Jamalzada said she hopes the U.S. Congress passes the Afghan Adjustment Act. She said she wants her friends and family already in the U.S. to not have to worry about their ability to live and work in the country.<br/>
贾马尔扎达说，她希望美国国会能通过《阿富汗调整法案》。她说，她希望已经在美国的朋友和家人可以不必担心他们在美国的生活和工作能力。</p>
<p>"You never know what's gonna happen to you," she said.<br/>
她说：“你永远不知道在你身上会发生什么。”</p>

            <title>Australian Vote Could Give 'Voice' to Indigenous Communities  (2023/9/8)</title>

<p>Some of Australia's <strong>Indigenous</strong> communities are hoping a national vote that would change the country's constitution could give native people more of a voice in the government.</p>
<p>The vote, known as a referendum, would put in the nation's constitution a way for Indigenous people to advise Parliament on policies that affect their lives. The vote, officially called "Voice to Parliament," will be held on October 14.</p>
<p>Leaders of some Indigenous groups are looking to the process to help save their cultures and languages. Clark Webb is seeking to do that for his native, or Aboriginal, community, the Gumbaynggirr people.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Educator Clark Webb performs a song with children including his daughter Jayalaani, at the Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom School, a bilingual school teaching the Gumbaynggirr language, in Coffs Harbour, Australia June 1, 2023.

<p>Webb recently led a class of schoolchildren as they danced to native songs. "Opening our own schools, that's <strong>sovereignty</strong> in action," Webb said.</p>
<p>He and others want to bring back the Indigenous language spoken in Coffs Harbor, a coastal town about 500 kilometers north of Sydney. "And so we need that 'Voice' there to <strong>lobby</strong> for that."</p>
<p>Webb started the Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom School last year. It was the first bilingual Indigenous school in Australia's most populous state of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The effort is part of an attempt to bring back dozens of languages that are close to dying out. It is being supported by federal and state governments.</p>
<p>Many of Australia's Indigenous people see the recovery of languages as very important to the survival of their cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Oldest culture</strong></p>
<p>Australia's Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities are perhaps the world's oldest. They have a history on the continent dating back tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>After colonization by Great Britain in 1788, the people increasingly faced discrimination, which continued long after Australia became a nation in 1901.</p>
<p>Government officials often moved Indigenous people from their traditional lands, known as Country. They forcibly separated Indigenous children from their families, resulting in a "stolen generation" from the mid-19th century to the 1970s.</p>
<p>As late as the 1980s, officials punished Indigenous people for speaking their languages.</p>
<p>"I think, growing up, I knew there was something missing from my life," Webb said. "And as I got older, I realized that ... was our language."</p>
<p>Webb estimates there are now about 30 <strong>proficient</strong> or highly proficient speakers of Gumbaynggirr. Among them is his nine-year-old daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Language revival</strong></p>
<p>Australia has one of the world's highest rates of language loss in the world.</p>
<p>At the time of European colonization, more than 250 Indigenous languages, including 800 <strong>dialects</strong>, were believed to have been spoken on the continent.</p>
<p>But the most recent population data shows that more than 150 languages were still being spoken in 2021. However, just 9.5 percent of indigenous Australians reported speaking one or more languages at home.</p>
<p>Ray Ingrey is one of a handful of people fluent in Dharawal. It was the first language heard by British explorer Captain James Cook when he landed in Australia in 1770.</p>
<p>Ingrey heads the Gujaga Foundation. It was founded in 2019 to bring back the language. He said government policies in those days severely hurt the ability to pass the language on from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>Officials had barred the grandparents of Webb and Ingrey from speaking their native languages. And some relatives were threatened by the police for speaking it anywhere.</p>
<p>Author and teacher Jasmine Seymour is leading efforts to revive the Dharug Aboriginal language among hundreds of schoolchildren in Sydney. Most of the children are non-Indigenous.</p>
<p>Seymour is related to<strong> </strong>Maria Lock, the first Aboriginal person to marry a European settler and one of the first admitted to a school to learn English.</p>
<p>"To be at the other end of history, where my language is being <strong>revitalized</strong> in school, is completely <strong>profound</strong>," she said.</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">07 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of many news reports this year. It has also been part of many everyday discussions.</p>
<p>It will likely continue to be a popular subject of discussion in the coming years, too.</p>
<p>So, how might one talk about artificial intelligence? What kinds of terms and structures should you use?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: DIscussing Artificial Intelligence" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d40f-08dbae161aba_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: DIscussing Artificial Intelligence</span></div>
<p>In this week's Everyday Grammar, we will explore a point of connection between grammar and technology. You will learn how to ask questions about artificial intelligence. You will also learn some ways to express your own opinions about AI.</p>
<p><strong>Questions – open ended </strong></p>
<p>Let's start with questions. Questions generally come in two forms – yes or no questions and open-ended questions.</p>
<p>Yes or no questions ask for a yes or a no answer.</p>
<p>Open-ended questions are seeking more information than a simple yes or no answer.</p>
<p>Open-ended questions are the secret to good discussions. By asking open-ended questions, you can learn much more about the thoughts and opinions of others.</p>
<p>We often use question words to ask open-ended questions. When we discuss artificial intelligence, a few question words will be especially useful. These are what, why, and how.</p>
<p>Consider these three questions:</p>
<p><em>What do you think of artificial intelligence? </em></p>
<p><em>Why are people concerned about artificial intelligence? </em></p>
<p><em>How will artificial intelligence affect our lives? </em></p>
<p>Note that there is a general structure to all of these questions. They begin with the question word. Then, they involve some kind of helping verb: do, be, or will. Then we have the subject of the sentence, the main verb, and the rest of the sentence. If we reduced these ideas into a kind of math formula, you might say the following:</p>
<p><em>Open-ended question = A question word + a helping verb + a subject + a main verb + the rest of the sentence </em></p>
<p>We can ask open-ended questions in different tenses. For example, we could ask about the past, as in:</p>
<p><em>How did you first hear about artificial intelligence?</em></p>
<p>In this case, we changed the helping verb do into its past form, did.</p>
<p>We can also ask about the future, as in:</p>
<p><em>How will artificial intelligence change our lives over the next 20 years? </em></p>
<p><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p>We have explored questions. But how can we answer such questions?</p>
<p>One way to think of your answer is in terms of good, bad, and mixed. You might use terms such as positive, negative, optimistic or pessimistic.</p>
<p>Consider this question:</p>
<p><em>What do you think of artificial intelligence? </em></p>
<p>You might have a positive opinion and say something like this:</p>
<p><em>I am optimistic about artificial intelligence. </em></p>
<p>You might have a negative opinion and say something like this:</p>
<p><em>I am pessimistic about artificial intelligence. </em></p>
<p>If your views go both ways, you might say:</p>
<p><em>I have mixed opinions about artificial intelligence. </em></p>
<p>Of course, after all of these answers, you should be prepared to give more details. We often use the word "because" followed by a clause – a subject and predicate group.</p>
<p>So, you might say</p>
<p><em>I am optimistic about artificial intelligence because people will be more productive with it. </em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>I am pessimistic about artificial intelligence because I think it will hurt the labor force in a powerful way. </em></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts </strong></p>
<p>In today's lesson, we explored a few ways to ask questions and give answers about artificial intelligence. Such discussions could take place in an everyday discussion or as part of an English test.</p>
<p>Let's end today with a homework assignment. Write an answer to the question you heard earlier in the report:</p>
<p><em>How will artificial intelligence change our lives over the next 20 years? </em></p>
<p>Before writing your answer, be sure to consider what views you have. Ask yourself if you see the future in a positive way, a negative way, or in a mixed way. Send us your answers at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com" target="_blank">learningenglish@voanews.com</a></p>

<span class="datetime">06 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says Earth just had its hottest summer ever in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Summer ends on September 22 this year in the world's northern half.</p>
<p>Last month was the hottest August ever recorded with modern equipment since 1979. It was also the second hottest month ever measured, behind only July 2023. The WMO and the European climate service Copernicus made the announcement Wednesday.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A man cools off from the intense heat in Lisbon, Portugal on Aug. 6, 2023. UN weather agency says Earth had the hottest summer ever in the northern hemisphere.

<p>August was about 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the limit world leaders have said the world must not pass. Scientists, however, are more concerned about temperature increases over many years and not just a few months.</p>
<p>So far, Copernicus said 2023 has been the second hottest year that it has recorded, behind only 2016. But the University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer, a website, reported that daily September temperatures are higher than those recorded for the same period in earlier years.</p>
<p>The WMO also said the world's oceans were the hottest ever recorded at nearly 21 degrees Celsius. Water covers more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>"The dog days of summer are not just <strong>barking</strong>, they are biting," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. "Dog days of summer" is an expression used to describe the time of hot and humid weather during the summer. The expression might have come from ancient Greece when extreme heat was said to drive both dogs and humans insane.</p>
<p>Scientists blame the heat on the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and the added influence from El Nino for the warming climate. El Nino is a temporary warming of the southern Pacific Ocean that affects weather worldwide. The weather event changes weather around the world and even more so in its second year.</p>
<p>Climatologist Andrew Weaver was not surprised by the numbers. He said governments have not taken global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will forget the issue when temperatures fall again.</p>
<p>"It's time for global leaders to start telling the truth," said Weaver who is a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. "We will not limit warming to 1.5 Celsius; we will not limit warming to 2.0 Celsius. It's <strong>all hands on deck</strong> now to prevent 3.0 Celsius global warming."</p>
<p>Copernicus Climate Change Service Director Carlo Buontempo said the high temperatures were "not only new extremes" but continuing "record-breaking conditions."</p>
<p>While the world's air and oceans were setting records for heat, Antarctica continued to set records for low amounts of sea ice, the WMO, the United Nations weather agency, said.</p>
<p>"Antarctic sea ice extent was literally <strong>off the charts</strong>, and the global sea surface temperature was once again at a new record," WMO's secretary-general, Petteri Taalas, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Taalas added, "It is worth noting that this is happening BEFORE we see the full warming <strong>impact</strong> of the El Nino event."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>India has changed the look of its capital, New Delhi, substantially in preparation for a meeting of international leaders this week. The two-day meeting of the Group of Twenty (G20) opens Saturday.<br/>
印度大幅改变了首都新德里的面貌，为本周举行的国际领导人会议做准备。为期两天的二十国集团会议将于周六开幕。</p>
<p>The Indian government spent about $120 million on the New Delhi project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "beautification process." But, many of the city's poor say that process destroyed homes and small businesses, leaving them displaced and without a way to make money. They say they feel erased, treated like the many dogs and m<i>onkey</i>s removed from neighborhoods in the city.<br/>
印度政府在新德里项目上花费了约1.2亿美元。总理纳伦德拉·莫迪称之为“美化过程”。但是，该市的许多穷人表示，这一过程摧毁了房屋和小企业，使他们流离失所，没有办法赚钱。他们说，他们觉得自己被抹去了，受到了像城市里许多被赶出社区的狗和猴子一样的待遇。</p>
<p>About 20 million people live in New Delhi. India's total population is 1.4 billion.<br/>
大约有2000万人生活在新德里。印度总人口为14亿。</p>
<p>Since January, hundreds of houses and small roadside businesses have been destroyed, displacing thousands of people. Dozens of poor neighborhoods called shantytowns were crushed to the ground. In many cases, residents did not receive timely warnings about the planned destruction.<br/>
自1月份以来，数百所房屋和路边小企业被毁，数千人流离失所。数十个被称为棚户区的贫困社区被夷为平地。在多数情况下，居民没有及时收到关于计划破坏的警告。</p>
<p>Officials say they carried out the demolitions against illegal properties. Rights activists and the displaced citizens say the destruction has pushed thousands more into homelessness.<br/>
官员们表示，他们对非法财产进行了拆除。人权活动人士和流离失所的公民表示，这场破坏使成千上万的人无家可归。</p>
<p>Now, New Delhi roads are newly smooth and paths are brightly lit. The city's buildings have fresh paint and colorful flowers are everywhere.<br/>
现在，新德里的道路变得更加平坦，道路上灯火通明。这座城市的建筑刷上了新油漆，到处都是五颜六色的花朵。</p>
<p>The G20 includes the world's 19 wealthiest countries and the European Union. The leaders meeting, or summit, will take place at a new conference center near the famous India Gate monument.<br/>
二十国集团包括世界上最富有的19个国家和欧盟。这场领导人会议或峰会将在著名的印度门纪念碑附近的一个新的会议中心举行。</p>
<p>Similar shantytowns were also destroyed in other Indian cities where lower-level G20 meetings are taking place.<br/>
在印度其他正举行20国集团低级别会议的城市，类似的棚户区也被摧毁。</p>
<p>In July, a report by a rights activist group found that preparations for the G20 summit resulted in the displacement of nearly 300,000 people. Many were from neighborhoods where diplomats were expected to visit for G20 events.<br/>
7月，一个维权组织的报告发现，20国集团峰会的筹备工作导致近30万人流离失所。许多人来自外交官预计将前往参加20国集团活动的社区。</p>
<p>The report also said the government destroyed at least 25 shantytowns and night shelters to establish parks in their place. And, it said the government offered no shelters for the newly homeless.<br/>
报告还说，政府摧毁了至少25个棚户区和夜间避难所，在这些地方建造公园。它还说，政府没有为这些新近无家可归的人提供容身之地。</p>
<p>Abdul Shakeel is with the activist group Save Colony Forum. He said people's lives are being destroyed to better the city's "appearance."<br/>
阿卜杜勒·沙克尔是激进组织“拯救群居地论坛”的成员。他说，人们的生活正在被破坏，以改善城市的“外貌”。</p>
<p>"The money used for G20 is taxpayers' money. Everyone pays the tax," he said, including those made homeless by the demolitions.<br/>
他说：“G20用的是纳税人的钱。每个人都要纳税。”这里面就包括那些因拆迁而无家可归的人。</p>
<p>Rekha Devi lost her home in the project. She appealed to the government to save her house. She offered to provide documents to prove that generations of her family lived in the same house for almost 100 years.<br/>
瑞卡·德维在这个项目中失去了她的家。她呼吁政府保留她的房子。她主动提出提供文件，证明她家几代人在同一所房子里住了近100年。</p>
<p>The government refused to consider the papers and destroyed Devi's home.<br/>
政府拒绝考虑这些文件，并摧毁了德维的家。</p>

<p>Kelly McKernan's paintings are often striking images of female figures in bright colors of green, blue, pink or purple.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old artist from Nashville, Tennessee calls her works "<strong>surreal</strong>." She says they are "dealing with <strong>discomfort</strong> in the human journey."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Refik Anadol's Unsupervised exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023, in New York.

<p>Surviving as an artist is difficult enough. The pandemic made it worse. But now McKernan faces another threat: artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>McKernan uses the pronoun they instead of his or her to call themself. About a year ago, McKernan began seeing online images strangely similar to their own. They soon learned that companies were feeding artwork into AI systems to train software programs to create similar images.</p>
<p>McKernan told the Associated Press, "I didn't give my <strong>consent </strong>for my name or work to be used this way."</p>
<p>McKernan said they even tried to contact some of the companies to say "Hey, little artist here, I know you're not thinking of me at all, but it would be really <strong>cool</strong> if you didn't use my work like this." But there was no answer.</p>
<p>In January, McKernan, and two other artists, Karla Ortiz and Sarah Andersen, started legal action against three image-<strong>generator</strong> companies: Stability AI, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. They also named the online gallery DeviantArt in the case.</p>
<p>The artists are seeking to protect their <strong>copyrighted</strong> works and their careers. They say the AI image-generators violate the rights of millions of artists by using their artworks for training and then producing similar works that compete against the <strong>originals</strong>.</p>
<p>The artists are seeking damages and a court order to stop AI companies from using their works without permission.</p>
<p>McKernan said, "At the end of the day, someone's profiting from my work. I had <strong>rent</strong> due yesterday, and I'm $200 short... And it just doesn't feel right."</p>
<p>Stability AI would not comment to the <em>Associated Press </em>(<em>AP</em>) for the story. In a court document, the company said it uses simple words to create "new and <strong>unique</strong> images." The company added the program creates new works and does not violate copyright.</p>
<p>A Stability AI company official appeared before a U.S. Senate hearing in July. He said that artists are not paid for the images used to train AI software.</p>
<p>Midjourney and DeviantArt did not return emailed requests for comment.</p>
<p>Karla Ortiz works in the entertainment industry. Her work has been used in several well-known movies, including <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> and<em> Jurassic World</em>.</p>
<p>She feared that companies would think artists cost too much. Why, she asked, would companies employ artists if they can pay $30 a month for AI-generated works?</p>
<p>McKernan agreed: "Will I even have work a year from now?"</p>
<p>A federal judge in San Francisco will decide the case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a temporary win for human artists last month, another federal judge agreed with the decision by the U.S. Copyright Office not to issue copyright for AI-generated artwork.</p>

            <title>TV Show Explores Teaching at an Urban Public School  (2023/9/6)</title>

<p>An American TV show called <em>Abbott Elementary</em> is a <strong>comedy</strong> about teachers in a Philadelphia elementary school.</p>
<p>The show has been praised for being funny, <strong>smart</strong> and heartwarming and for dealing with important education issues. Over two seasons of 35 <strong>episodes</strong>, the show has explored education issues like school budgets, <strong>charter schools</strong> and teacher mental health.</p>
<p>The show is on ABC, one of the biggest American television networks. The show is being aired at a time of teacher shortages and debates about how race issues and history should be taught.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Quinta Brunson plays second-grade teacher Janine on ABC's Abbott Elementary (ABC/Gilles Mingasson)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-ddba-08db8c806273_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Quinta Brunson plays second-grade teacher Janine on ABC's Abbott Elementary (ABC/Gilles Mingasson)</span></div>
<p>The creator and star of the show is Quinta Brunson. Brunson's mother was a public school teacher in Philadelphia. Brunson plays a young, second-grade teacher named Janine at Abbott Elementary. The show follows several other teachers at Abbott, which is a badly supervised and majority-Black school that does not have enough money. Although the teachers often run into trouble with students and the administration, they care about their jobs and try to help their students.</p>
<p>Brunson said in an interview with <em>Education Week</em> that two writers on the show are former teachers. She said she wanted all the writers to have "a healthy relationship to education."</p>
<p>She added that since the COVID-19 pandemic, education has been a subject on the minds of everyone.</p>
<p>"Three years ago, no one was talking about teachers as much as they are now," Brunson said. "And now, everywhere we look, we're talking about education...I hope that it leads us into a better place in this country with our treatment of education, specifically public education."</p>
<p>Sara Jones is a professor of elementary education at Illinois State University. Next spring, she will be teaching a class on <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. At each class, students will watch an episode of the show then discuss an issue related to urban education that appeared in that episode. The class will also read related research papers from education experts.</p>
<p>Jones is a former elementary school teacher and has researched urban education. She said the show covers many issues that come up in her research like teacher shortages, teacher training and unfair use of public money.</p>
<p>"I immediately fell in love with the <strong>characters</strong> and the storytelling and that connection to my own teaching experience," Jones told VOA.</p>
<p>The class is part of the university's honors program instead of the education school, so it will have students from different areas of study. Jones added that the show is funny and interesting but deals with issues in a simple way that people who are not involved in education can understand.</p>
<p>A repeated issue in the show's second season is the charter school movement. Charter schools receive public money but operate outside the public school system. Charter schools also receive private money. Businessmen like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Microsoft chief Bill Gates have invested money in some charter schools. In <em>Abbott</em>, a group called Legendary Charter schools threatens to turn every public school in Philadelphia into a charter school.</p>
<p>Charter schools do not have the same operating requirements as local government-operated public schools. Critics argue that charter schools receive local tax money that could go to traditional public schools.</p>
<p>In one episode, the teachers discuss the threat of Legendary charter schools. One of the older teachers, Barbara, says, charters "take our funding. Not to mention the private money from wealthy donors with <strong>ulterior</strong> <strong>motives</strong>."</p>
<p>But the principal, Ava, who is often portrayed as foolish says, "<strong>Weird</strong> cash swirling around? Don't threaten me with a good time."</p>
<p>Jones said the story explores urban school issues better than most shows on television, including the news media.</p>
<p>"I hope students will get from (this class) a deeper understanding of those issues and perhaps a shift in <strong>perspective</strong> about particularly urban schools."</p>
<p>Brunson said she hopes people who watch the show will be more likely to support schools and teachers.</p>
<p>"It's a public service," Brunson said of teaching. "Who are we without teachers? Who are we without the people who teach us how to read?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Officials at the U.S. Military Academy West Point in New York state recently opened a time capsule that is 195 years old live on the internet.<br/>
纽约州西点军校官员最近通过网上直播打开了一个有195年历史的时间胶囊。</p>
<p>The event on August 28 caused disappointment because the container appeared to contain nothing more than dirt. But West Point officials said last Wednesday that the box did contain hidden treasure after all.<br/>
8月28日的这次活动让人们失望，因为盒子里似乎除了泥土什么都没有。但西点军校官员上周三表示，这个盒子里确实藏着宝藏。</p>
<p>A time capsule is a container that is filled with objects and buried or hidden. The capsule is meant to be opened by people living many years in the future.<br/>
时间胶囊是指装满物体并被掩埋或藏起来的容器。这个容器将被生活在多年之后的人们打开。</p>
<p>The lead box is believed to have been put in place by West Point military students. It was discovered inside the base of a memorial to Revolutionary War hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko.<br/>
据信，这个铅盒是西点军校学生放置的。它是在独立战争英雄撒迪乌斯·科希丘什科纪念碑的基座内发现的。</p>
<p>The capsule contained six silver American coins dating from 1795 and 1828 and a medal, West Point said in a news release. The ceremonial opening of the box happened at the military school in New York state.<br/>
西点军校在一份新闻稿中表示，这个容器内装有六枚1795年至1828年的美国银币和一枚奖章。开箱仪式在这所位于纽约州的军校举行。</p>
<p>Speaking of the event, West Point archeologist Paul Hudson said: "When I first found these, I thought, man, you know, it would have been great to have found these on stage." After the opening, he took the box back to his laboratory and began carefully looking through the remains.<br/>
西点军校考古学家保罗·哈德森在谈到这次活动时表示：“当我找到这些东西时，我想，要是能在台上（直播时）发现它们就好了。”打开盒子后，他把盒子带回了实验室，然后开始仔细查看残留物。</p>
<p>He said he then found the edge of a coin in the dust inside the box. "I thought, well that's OK. That's something, that's a start," Hudson said.<br/>
他称自己随后在盒子里的灰尘中发现了一枚硬币的边缘。哈德森说：“我想，好吧，没关系。这是一个开始。”。</p>
<p>He said he felt let down like everyone else by the lack of results from the live opening. The crowd that gathered at the U.S. Military Academy hoped to see historical military objects or documents when experts opened the top and pointed a camera inside.<br/>
他说，对于在直播打开时没有发现，他和其他人一样感到失望。聚集在这所美国军事学院的人群希望在专家打开盒盖并将相机对准内部时能够看到历史军事物品或文件。</p>
<p>It was probably better to remove the coins and medal in a controlled setting, added Hudson. He still plans to study the remains for possible answers to what else might be inside.<br/>
哈德森补充道，最好在可控的环境中移去硬币和奖牌。他仍然计划研究这些残留物，以期找到答案，弄清楚里面可能还有什么。</p>
<p>It appears that moisture and possibly dirt entered the box through a damaged edge. The conditions could have destroyed materials like paper or wood.<br/>
看上去水汽和泥土是通过损坏的边缘进入了盒子。这种情况可能会破坏纸张或木材等材料。</p>
<p>What did survive was a five-cent coin from the year 1795, an 1800 Liberty Dollar, an 1818 25-cent coin, 10-cent, and 1-cent coins from 1827, and an 1828 50-cent coin. There was also a medal remembering the Erie Canal from 1826.<br/>
残留下来的是一枚1795年的5美分硬币、一枚1800年的自由银币、一枚1818年的25美分硬币、1827年的10美分硬币和1美分硬币各一枚，以及一枚1828年的50美分硬币。还有一枚纪念1826年伊利运河的奖章。</p>
<p>The discoveries seem to confirm school officials' theory that the box was put in place by military students in 1828 or 1829. The monument to Kosciuszko, which included a statue of him, was completed at about that time.<br/>
这些发现似乎证实了学校官员推测的盒子是1828年或1829年由军校学生安放的。科希丘什科纪念碑，包括他的雕像，大约是在那个时候造好的。</p>
<p>A group of five military students, or cadets, was involved in the ceremony dedicating the monument. One of them was U.S. Civil War general Robert E. Lee who graduated in 1829.<br/>
一个由五名军校学员组成的小组参与了纪念碑的落成仪式。其中一位是1829年毕业的美国内战将领罗伯特·E·李。</p>
<p>Kosciuszko had designed wartime fortifications for the Continental Army at West Point during the Revolutionary War. He died in 1817. The statue of Kosciuszko was added to the monument in 1913.<br/>
科希丘什科在独立战争期间为大陆军在西点军校设计了战时防御工事。他于1817年去世。科希丘什科的雕像于1913年被添加到纪念碑中。</p>
<p>The historical preservation and research of the time capsule will continue.<br/>
对时间胶囊的历史保存和分析将继续进行。</p>
<p>"I think there's more that we can learn from this," Hudson said.<br/>
哈德森说：“我认为我们可以从中学到更多东西。”</p>

            <title>US Extends Protection for Migrants from Six Countries  (2023/9/6)</title>

<span class="datetime">05 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden recently announced it is extending temporary protection from <strong>deportation</strong> to migrants from six countries.</p>
<p>Nationals of Sudan, Ukraine, El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua can remain in the United States under the extended policy.</p>
<p>The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program permits migrants, whose home countries are considered unsafe, to live and work in the United States. They can do so under the program although they do not have normal legal permission to be in the country. However, they can only be in the U.S. for a set period of time, and they must meet U.S. government requirements.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Demonstrators participate in the March for TPS (Temporary Protected Status) Justice during a protest in support of permanent residency, outside the White House in Washington, Feb. 12, 2019. (Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01460000-0aff-0242-4fb4-08da65d00dde_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Demonstrators participate in the March for TPS (Temporary Protected Status) Justice during a protest in support of permanent residency, outside the White House in Washington, Feb. 12, 2019.

<p>Daniel Costa is director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, an organization based in Washington, D.C. Costa said current TPS holders have high employment rates and add billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year.</p>
<p>"TPS raises <strong>wages</strong> through...work <strong>authorization</strong> for people who don't have it...Higher wages also mean more spending back in the economy, which creates more jobs," he said.</p>
<p>The United States first gave Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador Temporary Protected Status more than 20 years ago. When the Biden administration extended TPS for those countries in June, it was for people who were current TPS holders.</p>
<p>If the Biden administration again gives those countries temporary protected status, it would expand TPS for many people. It would permit any qualifying migrant who entered the U.S. during the last 20 years to receive TPS.</p>
<p>A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-value-of-temporary-protected-status-as-a-u-s-policy-tool/" target="_blank">report by the Niskanen Center</a>, a Washington-based policy research organization, said the "<strong>vast</strong> majority" of TPS holders are employed.</p>
<p>"More than 94 percent of TPS holders were in the labor force as of 2017," the report stated. It said that they worked in industries including sales and health care. The 2017 report warned that ending TPS for just El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti would cause the U.S. economy to lose over $160 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Adding new countries</strong></p>
<p>Immigrant organizations have called for the U.S. to give new TPS <strong>designations</strong>. They hope the government will add Mauritania and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the program.</p>
<p>Nils Kinuani is the immigration coordinator for the Congolese Community of Washington Metropolitan. He told VOA the group had conversations with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials in April.</p>
<p>"We have been also working with congressional leaders to push for this designation," Kinuani said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State says the DRC is suffering a humanitarian crisis marked by over 20 years of civil war and conflict.</p>
<p>Leaders of Black Mauritanians say the U.S. had an earlier policy of not deporting Mauritanians because of the country's human-rights record. Haddy Gassama is with the organization UndocuBlack Network. She wrote that the abuses "include the practice of enslaving Black people" and keeping a system of apartheid.</p>
<p>Apartheid is a political system of racial separation.</p>
<p>In January, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown and Republican Representative Mike Carey sent a letter to Biden and other government officials to support TPS for Mauritanians living in the U.S. without legal permission.</p>
<p>Congress established TPS in 1990. Currently, 16 countries are <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status" target="_blank">designated for the program</a>.</p>
<p>Current TPS holders who want to extend their protection must register again during the 60-day registration period for their country's designation. Re-registration opens soon for four countries, starting with El Salvador on September 10.</p>
<p>TPS designations are set for six, 12, or 18 months. About two months before a country's TPS ends, the DHS secretary has to decide if the U.S. will end or extend the TPS.</p>
<p>The TPS program does not lead to permanent U.S. <strong>residency</strong>. As of March, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/RS20844.pdf" target="_blank">about 610,000 foreign nationals</a> held temporary protected status.</p>
<p>TPS holders who leave the U.S. without first getting a travel authorization may lose their TPS status and may not reenter the country.</p>

            <title>Scientists: Maine’s Puffin Bird Population Is Recovering  (2023/9/5)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">04 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Scientists studying the Atlantic puffin population off the coast of Maine say the birds are now recovering after suffering major losses in 2021.</p>
<p>Atlantic puffins look and walk similarly to penguins. Wildlife officials say reproductions for the animals on islands off the coast of Maine fell sharply in 2021. But last year, about two-thirds of puffins in the area produced young. While the numbers did not reach that same level this year, the birds still had a better year than in 2021.</p>
<p>The main reason for the decreasing numbers is a drop in the population of small fish puffins feed on, such as herring. Two years ago, puffin colonies suffered one of the lowest reproduction rates in many years because of a lack of those fish. Only about one-quarter of the birds were able to raise young in 2021.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An Atlantic puffin brings a beak full of baitfish to feed its chick in a burrow under rocks on a small island off mid-coast Maine, Sunday, Aug. 5, 2023. (AP Photo/Robert F.

<p>Environmental groups have linked the lower fish populations in the area to warming ocean temperatures. The Gulf of Maine, which has puffin colonies on its islands, is warming faster than most of the world's oceans. Some recent years have been especially warm and local climate officials have said this summer appears to have been "still unusually warm."</p>
<p>Bill Sydeman is the president and chief scientist at the Farallon Institute, a <strong>conservation</strong> organization based in California. He told The Associated Press the reasons for the puffin population drop include deadly heat waves, loss of food, loss of islands to sea level rise and an inability to reproduce, or breed.</p>
<p>"The problem with climate change is these breeding failures and low breeding productivity years are now becoming <strong>chronic</strong>," Sydeman said. "There will be fewer young birds in the population that are able to <strong>recruit</strong> into the breeding population."</p>
<p>Maine's puffins are the only breeding Atlantic puffins in the United States. Worldwide, the species lives in the North Atlantic from Maine and Canada to Europe. Other countries with large puffin populations, such as Iceland, have also seen their bird populations drop.</p>
<p>The Maine puffin population once fell to only about 70 pairs in an area known as Matinicus Rock. Hunters who went after the birds for their meat and feathers had nearly destroyed them by the early 1900s. Stephen Kress is a scientist with the Audubon Society who has sought to grow puffin colonies since the 1970s. His attempts included moving young puffins from Canada to Eastern Egg Rock, another small island in the area.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials say adult birds in the colonies appear fairly strong, and it's "likely the population is stable, and it could still be growing," said Don Lyons. He is the director of conservation science at the National Audubon Society's Seabird Institute in Bremen, Maine.</p>
<p>The difficulties facing seabirds make successful breeding seasons especially important, said P. Dee Boersma. She is a University of Washington professor of biology and director of the university's Center for Ecosystem Sentinels.</p>
<p>"What that means is we should be more <strong>cautious</strong> and concerned about reproductive failures and things like that to make sure that in good years everyone that wants to has a chance to breed, and do well," Boersma said.</p>

<p>Brynn Schulte nearly died two times when she was a baby. At one point she needed emergency <strong>surgery</strong> for bleeding in her brain.</p>
<p>No one knew what was wrong. Then, a test that looked at her full genetic details found a rare bleeding disorder. Catching the disorder early saved her life.</p>
<p>"You have this hopeless feeling when you don't really know what's going on," said her father, Mike Schulte. He noted that the test made a difference in finding the cause and "getting her the right care that she needed almost immediately."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Courtney Chase, a nurse at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, listens to 4-year-old Brynn Schulte's heart before the girl gets an infusion of medication to treat a rare genetic bleeding disorder, Aug. 3, 2023, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<p>Brynn, now 4, got the genetic testing as part of a <strong>clinical </strong>trial. The results of which were published recently in <em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.</p>
<p>Testing all of the details of a person's genes is called "whole genome" testing. Whole genome tests are much better than narrowly targeted tests when it comes to finding genetic differences, called abnormalities, that can cause disease.</p>
<p>The study found 49 percent of these abnormalities, compared to 27 percent with more commonly used tests targeting only some genetic diseases.</p>
<p>Whole genome tests could solve the problem of doing several narrowly targeted tests on babies, which still might not find the disorder. Experts warn there are some problems because labs vary in how they understand results. Also, whole genome tests are costlier and less likely to be covered by <strong>insurance</strong>.</p>
<p>But researchers hope that whole genome tests will at some point be used for millions of hospitalized babies with rare and difficult conditions. The U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute has found that around 350 million people around the world live with rare disorders. And it found that about 80 percent of the more than 7,000 conditions are genetic.</p>
<p>"I've been doing clinical trials of babies for over 40 years," said study writer Dr. Jon Davis, chief of newborn medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. "It's not often that you can do something that you feel is going to really change the world and change clinical practice for everyone."</p>
<p><strong>No one was sure about Brynn's condition</strong></p>
<p>The night Brynn was born, she had difficulty breathing. There was also some bleeding in her brain. So, doctors gave her blood <strong>transfusions</strong> and tests for different bleeding problems. When Brynn was a month old, she had surgery after a huge brain bleed.</p>
<p>Her mother Lindsay Schulte said no one was sure about her condition. "I don't think we slept. I mean, watching your child nearly die in front of your eyes <strong>twice</strong> is a memory I'll never <strong>erase</strong>," she said.</p>
<p>Then the Schulte family learned about the clinical trial. Brynn and both parents got the whole genome testing. The results came in less than a week later: She had a rare bleeding disorder. It affects an estimated 1 in 2 million to 1 in 3 million live births. She also had another condition that caused a severe reaction to some drugs.</p>
<p>Doctors said the correct results would likely have taken more time or even missed with several narrow, targeted tests.</p>
<p>That is because targeted tests cover maybe 1,700 out of 20,000 genes. But whole genome testing "captures more things," said Dr. Paul Kruszka of GeneDx. It is a company that provides whole genome testing but was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>Dr. Jill Maron is a study writer and a chief of children's medicine at Women &amp; Infants Hospital in Rhode Island. She said full genome tests generally cost about three times more than narrow tests and are not covered by public insurance in most U.S. states.</p>
<p>Experts like her say that greater <strong>access</strong> to full genome tests is necessary if more children are going to be helped.</p>

            <title>London Artist Paints Crushed Chewing Gum  (2023/9/5)</title>

<p>Lying on London's famous Millennium Bridge, British artist Ben Wilson paints on a piece of dried <strong>gum</strong>. It has been crushed flat into the ground.</p>
<p>"The important thing is the gum is below the metal<strong> tread</strong>," said the 60-year-old Wilson. "The beauty of it is they're all different shapes and sizes...," he continued, describing pieces of gum.</p>
<p>Wilson sees possibility in things most people avoid looking at. The flattened gum is a chance to turn a piece of waste into something beautiful.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ben Wilson, artist, paints on the Millennium Bridge, London, Britain, August 21, 2023. (REUTERS/Anna Gordon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/331959f3-3b17-4880-b14c-138894efe4a5_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ben Wilson, artist, paints on the Millennium Bridge, London, Britain, August 21, 2023. (REUTERS/Anna Gordon)</span></div>
<p>The artwork also is a way to surprise walkers and get them to take a closer look at the path they are on.</p>
<p>"By painting a picture which is so small, those that see it then discover a hidden world beneath their feet," Wilson said.</p>
<p>Back in his north London art room, Wilson paints on the surface of a small <strong>mosaic tile</strong>. It will be part of a collection that he is creating on the walls of London's Underground train platforms. The images are more personal than the chewing gum works, Wilson says, and represent a kind of "visual <strong>diary</strong>."</p>
<p>"The pictures are a celebration of my life and those that I care dearly about," he said. "They are a process of visual inquiry - trying to make sense of the world," he added.</p>
<p>Wilson was born in London to artist parents. He remembers working with <strong>clay</strong> from the age of three. He had his first art show when he was around 10 or 11 years old.</p>
<p>He began making sculptures and large pieces for display in nature settings. Then his interest turned to waste, also called trash. He has been painting gum and other pieces of trash for 19 years.</p>
<p>The top surface of the dried gum is not subject to local or national laws. As a result, the dried gum surface creates a space where Wilson says he can paint without damaging public property.</p>
<p>"I found this little space where I could create a form of art where I could be <strong>spontaneous</strong> and do something which evolves out of the place in which it's created," Wilson said.</p>
<p>Government officials have removed much of the artist's public street art. But the hundreds of gum paintings on Millennium Bridge remain for all to see.</p>

            <title>US City Turns to Science to Help Reduce Gun Violence  (2023/9/5)</title>

<p>"That's where I got shot," said Rashaad Woods, pointing toward a small store in the city of Knoxville in the state of Tennessee. Nearby are a <strong>nightclub</strong> where some people were shot and killed and a church with bullet holes in the walls.</p>
<p>"There was a point in time I wasn't <strong>comfortable</strong> standing here," said Kodi Mills. "But that time is passing."</p>
<p>The two men work for Turn Up Knox, a community-based organization that began operating in July of 2022. It mentors children and teenagers on how to prevent conflicts from becoming violent. The project is a central part of city efforts to use research-based methods to reduce gun violence.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Knoxville Deputy Police Chief Tony Willis talks with Terry Walker-Smith after a meeting of the Violence Reduction Leadership Committee on Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023, in Knoxville, Tenn.

</span></div>
<p>Turn Up Knox began operating after a sharp rise in shooting deaths in Knoxville. The larger city effort to reduce gun violence includes policy changes in policing and other action.</p>
<p>However, it does not depend on restrictions to gun ownership. That was important, since Tennessee has repeatedly moved to loosen gun restrictions.</p>
<p>In 2021, Tennessee started letting people carry handguns in the open or hidden, without a permit. This year, the minimum age for carrying handguns dropped to 18.</p>
<p><strong>Turning to research for answers</strong></p>
<p>Indya Kincannon is the city's mayor.</p>
<p>"I wanted to be able to fix it," she said of the rising gun violence.</p>
<p>As the gun violence goes up in the United States, so has research into how to stop it. Researchers estimate there were more than 48,000 gun deaths last year, with gun-related killings and suicide rates not seen since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Gun-related incidents are now the leading cause of death among American children and teenagers.</p>
<p>Now, researchers say they know more about which public health strategies help reduce gun violence and which ones do not.</p>
<p>A report from the non-profit research group Rand Corporation points to policies that it found help reduce gun violence. These steps include laws that permit the charging of adults who let children have unsupervised <strong>access to</strong> guns. The researchers say strong background checks on gun purchasers also helps reduce gun violence. Another helpful measure involves banning guns from people with a legal record of family violence, Rand reported.</p>
<p>The RAND report also noted policies that do not help reduce gun violence. For example, it said <strong>concealed</strong> carry laws increase gun killings, as do gun buyback programs.</p>
<p><strong>East Knoxville and trusting police </strong></p>
<p>About 16 percent of Knoxville's population is Black and about 40 percent of that group is very poor. Many of them live in East Knoxville, where the firearm violence has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Like other American cities, violence increased in Knoxville during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, there were around 20 shooting deaths per year. The number rose to 38 in 2020 and grew again to 41 in 2021.</p>
<p>As shootings increased, Kincannon, the city's mayor, looked to ideas by Thomas Abt, a crime researcher at the University of Maryland. His plan includes having police and community organizations work closely together.</p>
<p>Abt's Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction at the University of Maryland worked with an outside researcher to study Knoxville's violent crime.</p>
<p>The study contained a few surprises, said Knoxville Deputy Police Chief Tony Willis.</p>
<p>Just 12 percent of killings by gun were related to organized criminal groups alone. That suggests many of the shootings only involved personal disagreements.</p>
<p>The city's plan centered first on areas in East Knoxville with high rates of gun violence. The effort involves church leaders and community organizations. It also included a new police chief, an investigative division centered on homicides and shootings, and officers who work mostly in areas with many shootings.</p>
<p>A goal is to increase public trust in law enforcement, which had been low.</p>
<p>"We would have someone get killed in broad daylight, with a lot of witnesses, but no one wanted to talk," Kincannon said. "That means we need more partnership in the community, to build trust."</p>
<p>That is where Turn Up Knox is expected to help. It involves ex-offenders, victims and other community members assisting. They help identify those most likely to be shot or to become shooters. They also mentor teenagers and operate a <strong>lawn</strong> service that gives jobs to kids. And, they teach families how to settle conflicts and deal with shooting events.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when someone is in danger of becoming the victim of a<strong> revenge</strong> shooting, Turn Up Knox gives the person a bus ticket to leave town for a few days.</p>
<p>However, some experts say programs built around Thomas Abt's ideas do not deal with enough of the problem. They note that the programs do not deal with suicide by gun nor the issue of poverty as a risk for gun violence.</p>
<p>Charlene Roberts' 25-year-old daughter, Jessie, was shot and killed in 2019 while sitting in a car. Her son Kevin, 33, was killed in 2021 in gunfire at a birthday party.</p>
<p>She is now raising Jessie's son, Princeton. She says he is strong but that he has also changed.</p>
<p>"He always had the biggest smile, just like his mother," she said. "It breaks my heart. He <strong>fakes</strong> a smile now. He don't have that smile anymore."</p>

<p>Sky watchers around the world were <strong>treated</strong> this month to two full moons, a supermoon and a blue moon.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/922/what-is-a-supermoon/">explains</a> a supermoon happens when the moon's orbit brings it closer than usual to Earth at the same time that the moon appears full from Earth. The first supermoon of 2023 was in July. The fourth and last one will be in September.</p>
<p>The last time two supermoons appeared in the sky in the same month was in 2018, The Associated Press reports. The next time a blue supermoon is set to arrive is 2037.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The supermoon rises behind the ancient temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Athens, Greece, Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d34a-08dbaa956c6f_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The supermoon rises behind the ancient temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Athens, Greece, Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis)</span></div>
<p>The first supermoon arrived on the first day of August, while the blue moon was seen beginning August 30. NASA noted that when the blue moon arrived, the planet Saturn was just a few days from its closest and brightest appearance of the year from Earth. Saturn appeared as a bright "star" to the upper right of the blue moon.</p>
<p>Italian astronomer Gianluca Masi, creator of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.virtualtelescope.eu/">Virtual Telescope Project</a>, held an online watch event as the blue supermoon was setting below the skyline of Rome. But he advised that, as long as the weather was good, world observers looking to the sky would not need any special equipment to see the moons.</p>
<p>"Warm summer nights are the ideal time to watch the full moon rise in the eastern sky within minutes of sunset," said retired NASA astrophysicist and moon expert Fred Espenak.</p>
<p>Full moons happen at the exact moment when the moon is opposite the sun, NASA says. Astronomers say a supermoon can appear about 14 percent larger and a bit brighter than other moons.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.almanac.com/">Old Farmer's Almanac</a> notes that the August full moon is known as the sturgeon moon. This is because of a traditionally large increase in fish in the American Great Lakes area during the month of August.</p>
<p>Although it is called a blue moon, it does not appear blue in color. Instead, the name means it is the second full moon to happen within one month or the fourth to take place in a season.</p>
<p>NASA says the moon takes 27.3 days to orbit Earth, but it takes 29.5 days to complete a full moon cycle. This is what makes it possible to see one full moon at the start of the month and another one right at the end.</p>
<p>Astronomers say, however, that the moon can look blue under the right conditions. For example, this can happen as a result of smoke or dust particles in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>While the blue supermoon brings the possibility for watching and taking beautiful pictures, its stronger gravitational pull also can influence higher tides. Weather experts advise people living in areas near shorelines to be aware of this, especially during storm activity.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of moons that appear at different times.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/full-moons/en/">says</a> a blood moon happens during a total lunar <strong>eclipse</strong>. This event is when Earth lines up between the moon and the sun, hiding the moon from sunlight. In addition, the term blood moon can also be used to describe a moon that appears reddish because of dust, smoke or <strong>haze</strong> particles in the sky.</p>
<p>A harvest moon is a full, bright moon that appears "closest to the start of autumn," NASA explains. This name dates from the time before electricity, when farmers depended on the moon's light to harvest their crops late into the night. The moon's light was especially important during fall when harvests are the largest.</p>

<p>Spain has spoken loudly through its government, politicians, soccer teams and ordinary citizens to condemn the leader of its soccer federation for kissing a player.</p>
<p>Luis Rubiales kissed soccer player Jenni Hermoso on the mouth just after Spain defeated England to win the women's soccer World Cup in August.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old Rubiales took the action during the awards ceremony following the game. Hermoso is one of the star players on Spain's team. The 33-year-old said she did not want or like the kiss.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Spain's Jennifer Hermoso celebrates with President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Luis Rubiales after the match, August 20, 2023. (REUTERS/Hannah Mckay)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9bdb-08dba391259e_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Spain's Jennifer Hermoso celebrates with President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Luis Rubiales after the match, August 20, 2023. (REUTERS/Hannah Mckay)</span></div>
<p>FIFA, the world soccer governing body, later suspended Rubiales for 90 days. The Spanish government is considering whether to push for his permanent removal from the job.</p>
<p>Some Spanish women who grew up playing soccer said kisses and unwanted touches from male leaders were common. They want the behavior to change.</p>
<p>Patricia Otero is 30. She is a high school teacher but still plays soccer in her free time. She said "we have seen that all our lives," when asked about Rubiales' actions.</p>
<p>She said male <strong>coaches</strong> would often touch her and say "you are like a daughter to me." Otero said she was too young to know it was wrong. "You think it is normal," she said.</p>
<p>People in Spain now say it is time to end sexism in soccer. They point to policies and actions that favor boys and men over women and girls in the sport. For example, Otero said she and her teammates had to raise money for their team and clean their own <strong>locker rooms</strong>. The boys did not have to do that.</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press</em> recently <strong>interviewed</strong> Spanish women working in soccer and other professions. Many said that Rubiales' behavior would have been ignored if the act had taken place 10 years earlier.</p>
<p>Maria Soleto is president of Spain's Women's Foundation. She said Spanish society has undergone a <strong>seismic</strong> shift.</p>
<p>At recent men's games in Spain's famous "La Liga," the country's top<strong> league</strong>, fans shouted repeatedly against Rubiales. They said he must leave his position. In Madrid, hundreds of people gathered in support of Hermoso.</p>
<p>The campaign of support is being called "Se Acabo" in Spain. It means "this is over." The male players on Sevilla's La Liga team wore the term on their soccer shirts.</p>
<p>The kiss may serve as a lesson for male leaders throughout the world. Lisa Banks is a civil rights and employment lawyer in Washington, D.C. She said men in sports now know "that an <strong>assault</strong> is an assault, even if it happens in a moment of <strong>jubilation</strong>."</p>
<p>Although the early reactions in Spain seemed to support Rubiales, the general opinion is now against him. The women's soccer team said it will not play any other games if he keeps his job. Government lawyers are deciding whether to open a case against Rubiales for sexual aggression. Some Spanish soccer federation officials are calling for his resignation.</p>
<p>Hermoso called the kiss "the <strong>final straw</strong>." She said the actions during the championship celebration "have been a part of our team's daily life for years."</p>
<p>Even before the kiss, the players had protested their treatment by soccer officials. Almost a year ago, 15 Spanish players said they would no longer play for <strong>coach</strong> Jorge Vilda if things did not get better. Spain's soccer federation sided with Vilda and replaced most of the players.</p>
<p>Other observers of women's sports hope the outcry over the kiss improves the financial conditions for women players. Some mid-level male soccer players earn close to $200,000 per year while the women only earn about $17,000.</p>
<p>Pilar Calvo of Spain's Association of Women in Professional Sports said she has seen five times the number of protests over inequality in recent days.</p>
<p>She said people have talked about inequality in prize money, poor training centers and a lack of financial support.</p>
<p>Others, including Tona Is, a former player and coach, say they feel <strong>vindicated</strong>. She was a top player on Spain's under-17 team in 2018 and an assistant to Vilda until she was dismissed in 2020.</p>
<p>She said she lost her job because she protested about bad behavior by male leaders.</p>
<p>"Time has finally shown that we were right, that there have been <strong>inappropriate</strong> <strong>episodes</strong> inside the federation for years," she said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The United Nations human rights office says criminal groups have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia into unlawful online scam operations.<br/>
联合国人权办公室表示，犯罪集团已迫使东南亚数十万人从事非法网络诈骗活动。</p>
<p>A scam is a dishonest way to make money by tricking people.<br/>
诈骗是指通过欺骗人们来赚钱的一种不正当手段。</p>
<p>The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights released a new report on the issue on Tuesday. It said that at least 120,000 people in Myanmar and about 100,000 in Cambodia "may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams."<br/>
联合国人权事务高级专员办事处周二就此问题发布了最新报告。报告称，缅甸至少有12万人，柬埔寨约有10万人“可能身处被迫实施网络诈骗的境地”。</p>
<p>Cybercrime scams have become a major problem in several Asian countries. Many workers are forced to join in scams targeting people over the internet. Criminal groups have increasingly targeted migrants. They offer false promises of real employment to the victims.<br/>
网络犯罪诈骗已成为几个亚洲国家的一个主要问题。许多工人被迫加入针对互联网用户的诈骗活动。犯罪集团越来越多地以移民为目标。他们向受害者提供真实就业的虚假承诺。</p>
<p>The U.N. rights office said it is hard to estimate how many people are caught up in such operations. It is also difficult to know how much money the criminal groups make through their scam operations. But it is believed to be in the billions of U.S. dollars every year.<br/>
联合国人权办公室表示，很难估计有多少人被卷入此类行动。也很难知道犯罪集团通过诈骗活动赚了多少钱。但据信每年都有数十亿美元。</p>
<p>Some victims have been subjected to torture, cruel punishments, sexual violence and other crimes, the rights office said.<br/>
人权办公室表示，一些受害者遭受了酷刑、残忍的惩罚、性暴力和其他罪行。</p>
<p>Pia Oberoi is a senior advisor on migration and human rights for the Asia-Pacific area at the U.N. human rights office. She described two kinds of victims: people who have lost large amounts of money and people trafficked into working for the scammers.<br/>
皮娅·欧贝罗伊是联合国人权办公室亚太地区移民和人权问题高级顾问。她描述了两种受害者：损失大量金钱的人士和被贩卖为骗子工作的人士。</p>
<p>Oberoi told reporters in Switzerland that many of the scams started during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns shut down casinos that were an important part of the economy along boarder areas and in Cambodia. The closures caused "economic distress" that left "middle class, educated...young people" out of work. Many of them got talked into working for the schemes.<br/>
欧贝罗伊在瑞士告诉记者，许多骗局始于新冠肺炎大流行期间。疫情封锁导致赌场关闭，这些赌场是边境地区和柬埔寨经济的重要组成部分。关闭造成了“经济困境”，导致“中产阶级、受过教育的年轻人”失业。他们中的许多人被说服为这些骗局效力。</p>
<p>In May, leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed in a meeting in Indonesia to increase border controls and law enforcement. And they agreed on increasing public education to fight criminal groups that traffic workers to other nations, where they join in the online scams.<br/>
5月，东南亚国家联盟领导人在印度尼西亚举行的一次会议上同意加强边境管制和执法。他们还同意加强公共教育，以打击将工人送往其他国家参与网络诈骗的犯罪集团。</p>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>International health officials are closely following a new version of COVID-19 as it spreads to more countries.</p>
<p>The version, or variant, is called BA.2.86. Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) say it has already been identified in several countries, including the United States, Switzerland, South Africa, Israel, Denmark and Britain.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently spoke to reporters about the latest COVID-19 developments. He said the new COVID-19 variants show that the virus remains a health threat around the world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, a student at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania demonstrates a viral RNA extraction on December 16, 2021. (REUTERS/Hannah Beier)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a292-08dba9a08485_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, a student at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania demonstrates a viral RNA extraction on December 16, 2021. (REUTERS/Hannah Beier)</span></div>
<p>Tedros noted the latest data show that COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations are decreasing. But he added that the agency had seen "increasing reports of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths in some countries." ICU is a short form for the term intensive care unit, part of a hospital that cares for very sick patients.</p>
<p>Maria Van Kerkhove is with the WHO's Health Emergencies Program. She said that, as of last week, only about 10 cases of the BA.2.86 variant had been found worldwide. But Van Kerkhove added that health officials are worried because the variant appears to have more than 30 genetic <strong>mutations</strong>.</p>
<p>She said the WHO is currently trying to closely follow the movements of the latest virus variants. The efforts include taking wastewater <strong>samples</strong> from different cities to follow where COVID-19 is spreading. In addition, such methods can help officials learn how fast current variants are spreading and how severe they are. "Governments cannot <strong>drop the ball</strong>," Van Kerkhove said.</p>
<p>Health officials say BA.2.86 broke off from the Omicron variant, which has been spreading in the U.S. at least since last year. It was first discovered in Denmark on July 24.</p>
<p>Some international scientists have said that while it is important to keep following BA.2.86, the variant was unlikely to cause a new, harmful wave of infections. This is because much of the population has built up defenses against COVID-19 because of vaccinations or previous infection.</p>
<p><strong>Testing new vaccines</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are currently testing how effective newly created COVID-19 vaccines will work against BA.2.86. Van Kerkhove noted that in the past, vaccines have been better at preventing severe sickness and death than blocking re-infections. U.S. health officials said earlier this month the latest COVID-19 vaccines are set to be released sometime in September.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) completed a risk report on the new variant last week. The report said BA.2.86 may be capable of causing infection in vaccinated people and those who had COVID-19 before. But officials noted there is so far no evidence that the new variant is causing more severe sickness than earlier ones.</p>
<p>The WHO said COVID-19 testing has dropped by 90 percent worldwide from the highest point of the pandemic. Testing rates have also fallen sharply in the U.S., and genetic <strong>sequencing</strong> is down by around 90 percent, said Dr. Ashish Jha. He served as the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator until June 2023.</p>
<p>Jha said data from hospital stays, emergency room visits, deaths, wastewater testing and sequencing efforts had given health officials improved information about current virus spread.</p>

            <title>West Virginia University to Cut Languages, Creative Programs  (2023/9/3)</title>

<span class="byline">By VOA</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>School leaders at West Virginia University recently proposed cutting almost 10 percent of the university's study programs and over 100 educators because of a $45 million budget deficit.</p>
<p>Included in the cuts were study programs, known as majors, in world languages, art history, jazz performance, creative writing, and degrees in math and education.</p>
<p>The languages include Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish. In addition, professors leading programs in <strong>linguistics </strong>and TESOL could be cut.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="West Virginia University students lead a protest against cuts to programs in world languages, creative writing and more amid a $45 million budget deficit outside Stewart Hall in Morgantown, W.Va., on Monday, Aug. 21, 2023.

<p><strong>‘Emotions are high'</strong></p>
<p>The university's Office of the Provost considered "several key <strong>metrics</strong>" to reduce or eliminate majors. The metrics included: the number of students interested in the majors, the <strong>ratio</strong> of students to professors in the program, the amount of money the programs bring to the school, and the future research plans each program had.</p>
<p>WVU released its plan in early August. The school permitted the affected programs to appeal the university's decision. The cuts resulted in a large protest on August 21.</p>
<p>The provost, one of the university's top leaders, is Maryanne Reed. At a meeting during the protests, she called the time "incredibly <strong>stressful</strong>," and noted, "emotions are very high right now."</p>
<p>The university's final plan will be announced in the middle of September.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal results</strong></p>
<p>The World Languages department appealed WVU's proposal on August 25, asking the university to reconsider part of its plan.</p>
<p>Lisa Di Bartolomeo is one of the professors in the department. She also attended the university as a student.</p>
<p>Before the appeal, she told VOA that cutting foreign language instruction would hurt students from West Virginia when they look for jobs. She said it would hurt their career earnings and hurt elementary and high school-aged children in West Virginia who depend on language teachers trained at WVU.</p>
<p>"The best and the brightest students don't see a future for themselves in West Virginia."</p>
<p>On August 29, WVU said it planned to follow through with much of its proposal. It is likely to cut all language majors but continue some teaching in both Spanish and Chinese. The university said it is important to continue with those languages because Spanish is in "high demand" and Chinese is a "critical need."</p>
<p>Reed said the university will remove a foreign language study requirement for students seeking Bachelor of Arts degrees. The university said it will work to support students who are interested in "<strong>immersive</strong> (language) experiences" through study abroad programs.</p>
<p><strong>Poor planning?</strong></p>
<p>Those who run the school are concerned about the state's decreasing population and the decreasing number of college-aged students. West Virginia is the only state in the U.S. with a population that is lower today than it was in 1950.</p>
<p>WVU has about 27,000 students. About 25,000 are at its main campus in Morgantown. That number is 10 percent lower than it was in 2015. That means the school takes in less money from students and taxpayers.</p>
<p>The population loss is one reason for the university's financial problems. New student housing and new academic buildings meant for a growing number of students are empty today.</p>
<p>E. Gordon Gee, the university president, said the cuts are needed so WVU can be "a competitive university on the national stage." He said the school is not taking its reduction proposal lightly. University leaders say study programs and professors are not all that are being cut.</p>
<p><strong>International students affected</strong></p>
<p>Among the 27,000 students at WVU, there are about 1,000 international students. Some of them are studying in the programs that might be <strong>eliminated</strong>. All of them will be permitted to finish their degrees. But no new students will come into the eliminated programs. That process is called a "teach out."</p>
<p>VOA Learning English spoke with two international students who are worried about their study programs: Jose Ramirez is a music and higher education graduate student from Colombia. Winda Melati is a higher education <strong>graduate</strong> student from Indonesia.</p>
<p>Ramirez also is a graduate of WVU's world languages program: he studied German.</p>
<p>He said the plan to take away most language teaching is "sad," and he wondered if the university no longer sees language learning as important.</p>
<p>Ramirez said:</p>
<p>"And it's also showing... like kind of the mentality of a lot of English speakers is that they don't need to learn another language because everybody (else) will learn English."</p>
<p>Melati said she is concerned for herself and other students who are in the U.S. on F-1, or student visas. Some, she noted, planned to stay at WVU to continue teaching or studying after completing their degrees. Now they may have to change their plans because of the cuts.</p>
<p>Melati and Ramirez both expressed concern about the programs and the value of their degrees if they are cut. Melati asked: "How can I be proud of (my work) if I graduate from a program that is no longer there?"</p>
<p>Ramirez said he feels lucky that he was able to study at WVU, but he feels sad that future students will not get the same instruction he did. They worry international students will not come to WVU after learning of the cuts.</p>
<p>But, Henry Oliver of the university's global affairs office believes the university will still appeal to international students.</p>
<p>"WVU has a really long-standing history and appeal for international students. And to be honest, I don't expect that to change."</p>
<p>He noted that popular WVU programs are safe. He listed most science, technology, engineering, math and business study programs. "These programs are still things that remain very strong at WVU and will continue to be strong," Oliver said.</p>
<p><strong>A compromise ahead?</strong></p>
<p>Many who are protesting the reductions say they would have liked to see the university do more to talk with professors, students, employees and West Virginians before announcing the cuts.</p>
<p>Both Di Bartolomeo and Ramirez are afraid there was not enough input from students, parents and graduates.</p>
<p>And Ramirez said, even with the appeal process, he believes most decisions have already been made.</p>
<p>"I would like to be wrong, but I think that everything is ... they are just seeing the numbers and the numbers are not making it."</p>

            <title>Explore from Your 'Armchair'  (2023/9/3)</title>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give definitions, examples, and notes on usage.</p>
<p>Today we talk about a piece of <strong>furniture</strong> used for sitting. As the name suggests, an armchair has extensions for resting your arms. So, armchairs are more <strong>comfortable</strong> than other chairs. In fact, they are so comfortable that people sit in them for hours.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pictured here is an traditional style armchair in front of some bookshelves." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-936e-08dbaa5c816c_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpeg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pictured here is an traditional style armchair in front of some bookshelves.</span></div>
<p>Besides being a kind of furniture, Americans use the word "armchair" in front of other words. They do this to describe different sorts of people and the experiences they might or might not have.</p>
<p>For example, some experiences can be called <strong>vicarious</strong>. If you live vicariously, you experience things through other people. You do not actually do the thing you are interested in yourself. Rather, you enjoy the activity by watching or reading about what others do.</p>
<p><u>Armchair detectives</u> are not real detectives investigating crimes. An armchair detective enjoys reading detective novels or watching true crime shows. Armchair detectives may even try to solve a crime. But all their efforts are done from the safety and comfort<strong> </strong>of their homes.</p>
<p>Living vicariously through others can be a wonderful chance to escape. Let's say you do not have the time or money to travel. But you still want to experience the pleasure of traveling. You can read about places that you would like to visit. You can watch travel <strong>documentaries</strong> about them too. And you can do these things from the comfort<strong> </strong>of your own home. So, you could call yourself an <u>armchair traveler. </u></p>
<p>If you enjoy watching and reading about people who do dangerous activities -- such as climbing Mount Everest or free diving into the depths of the ocean -- you might be an <u>armchair adventurer</u>.</p>
<p>However, we also use "armchair" to describe another sort of person. If someone does not have responsibility for a job but talks about it from a distance, we can use the word "armchair" to describe them. Also, if someone is not an expert in a subject, but gives advice anyway, we could use the word "armchair."</p>
<p>For example, an armchair <u><strong>strategist</strong></u> gives strategies that are more <strong>theoretical</strong> than <strong>practical</strong>. This means they are talking about a problem but are not actually involved in solving it.</p>
<p>In the same way, an <u>armchair general</u> gives advice on going into battle ... from a safe distance. Armchair generals are not involved in a real battle.</p>
<p>In the U.S., a favorite term comes from American football. <u>Armchair quarterbacks</u> comment on a football game from the comfort of their own chair. They criticize and insult the players who actually play the game while they themselves have never played it.</p>
<p>But the use of the term "armchair quarterback" goes far beyond the world of sports. So, you could hear the term used to describe anyone who does not do an activity or have responsibility but still makes sharp comments or criticizes others who work at the job every day.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Woodrow Wilson. He served two terms, from 1913 to 1921, and led the United States through the first World War.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Woodrow Wilson" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/92cf1972-5ba1-4b76-a2d3-807f2f365994_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Woodrow Wilson</span></div>
<p>Wilson might have seemed an unlikely war president. He was a university professor before he entered politics.</p>
<p>And, when the conflict began in Europe in 1914, Wilson strongly rejected the idea of the U.S. getting involved. He even campaigned for his second term on the slogan "He kept us out of the war."</p>
<p>But Wilson's idealism eventually made him believe the U.S. must enter the conflict. He famously said, "The world must be safe for democracy."</p>
<p>He spent the last months of his presidency fighting to create a league of nations that would prevent future wars.</p>
<p>Wilson did not succeed in that effort. But the effects of his presidency are still seen today in both the domestic and foreign affairs of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was born in the state of Virginia in 1856 and grew up in the South.</p>
<p>Wilson's father was a Protestant Christian minister who supported the views of the Confederacy during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Wilson's mother had been born in England but raised in the United States. She was reportedly warm and loving, especially to her husband and four children.</p>
<p>Wilson's early life was marked by poor health and a passion for learning. His education included tutoring by Confederate soldiers, classes with his father, a year at Davidson College, a bachelor's degree from the school now called Princeton, one year of law school, and a doctoral degree in history and political science from the University of Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>He remains, so far, the only president with a Ph.D.</p>
<p>Wilson's academic interests were in government, and how it could be most effective. Even as a young man, he supported the idea of a strong executive, either a prime minister or a president.</p>
<p>He wrote a number of books, including a biography of George Washington, and a history of the United States. He also taught popular classes at several colleges, including Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania, Wesleyan in Connecticut, and Princeton in New Jersey.</p>
<p>In time, Wilson became the president of Princeton. He made major reforms to the school until some faculty and alumni resisted his efforts.</p>
<p>Wilson had always been interested in political power. The Democratic Party in New Jersey became interested in Wilson when they were looking for a candidate with an honest public image.</p>
<p>In truth, party officials believed he would be a weak leader whom they could influence. Wilson surprised them by winning the seat as New Jersey governor easily, and then rejecting their efforts to control him.</p>
<p>He went on to pass major reform legislation in New Jersey that reduced corruption and protected the rights of workers. His actions drew the attention of Democratic Party leaders seeking a candidate for president in 1912.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency: first term</strong></p>
<p>Voters did not overwhelmingly choose Wilson in 1912. Although he did well in the Electoral College, he earned only a little more than 40 percent of the popular vote. Other votes were mostly divided between two former presidents, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-theodore-roosevelt/3986653.html" target="_blank">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americans-presidents-william-taft/3997949.html" target="_blank">William Taft</a>.</p>
<p>Yet Wilson quickly <strong>asserted</strong> authority over Congress and pushed through a number of laws aimed at dramatic reform.</p>
<p>Historian Kendrick Clements at the University of South Carolina <a class="wsw__a" href="https://millercenter.org/president/wilson/domestic-affairs">says</a> Wilson had a strongly progressive vision.</p>
<p>He was interested in "expanding economic <strong>opportunity</strong> for people at the bottom of society and <strong>eliminating</strong> special <strong>privileges</strong> enjoyed by the richest and most powerful members of society."</p>
<p>One of Wilson's most important acts was to create a new federal agency called the Federal Reserve Board. It still <strong>regulates</strong> American banks, credit, and money supply. He also created the Federal Trade Commission to ensure fair business practices, and the Department of Labor to protect workers' rights.</p>
<p>And he supported laws to reduce working hours for railroad employees, bar child labor, and offer government loans to farmers.</p>
<p>But even during Wilson's busy lawmaking, the threat of world war demanded his attention. Wilson had declared that the U.S. would remain neutral in the growing conflict between the Allied and Central Powers.</p>
<p>One of his reasons was that people in the U.S. were immigrants from the countries that were at war. Wilson did not want the conflict to divide Americans.</p>
<p>However, he permitted international trade, including with Britain and France. As a result, many believed the U.S. was favoring those countries.</p>
<p>In 1915, a German submarine sank a British ship called the Lusitania and killed more than 100 Americans on board.</p>
<p>Wilson protested several times to Germany about the sinking. He warned that the U.S. would not accept another such aggression. But two years later, Germany attacked U.S. <strong>commercial</strong> ships. It also invited Mexico to enter into an alliance against the United States.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Wilson's second term in office, he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency: second term</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. entered World War I on the side of the Allied Powers. The additional support came at an important time. American soldiers were able to help resist German troops in France.</p>
<p>In time, Germany asked for an <strong>armistice </strong>– an agreement to stop fighting.</p>
<p>Following the war, Wilson had a grand vision for how to gain lasting peace in Europe. In a speech known as "<a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wilson-outlines-the-fourteen-points">Fourteen Points</a>," he proposed that the countries that had won the war not punish Germany.</p>
<p>Wilson also wanted European colonies to rule themselves, and other areas be given immediate independence.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Wilson suggested a League of Nations that would guarantee the member countries' independence and safety.</p>
<p>But few world leaders agreed with his plan completely.</p>
<p>Even in the U.S., many Republican lawmakers in Congress resisted Wilson's idea for a League of Nations. Some strongly objected to any treaty that would limit the country's independence. Others did not want the country to be involved in world issues at all.So Wilson began a trip across the U.S. to raise public support for the League of Nations. He traveled more than 15,000 kilometers in 22 days and gave 29 speeches.</p>
<p>Wilson's doctors warned him that the trip was hard on his health. But Wilson was firm about pressuring Senate Republicans to adopt the agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, he collapsed from <strong>exhaustion</strong>. Shortly after, he suffered a major stroke. Although he recovered somewhat, he remained partly <strong>paralyzed</strong>. He rarely appeared in public again.Instead, Wilson communicated to Congress through his wife. When Republicans changed the treaty to deal with their concerns, Wilson told his supporters to reject it.</p>
<p>In the end, the U.S. never did join the League of Nations.</p>
<p>When a new president, Warren Harding, was sworn-in in 1921, Edith and Woodrow Wilson retired to a house in Washington, D.C. Three years later, the former president died quietly there, finally at peace.</p>

<span class="datetime">01 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>About an hour's drive from the tall buildings of Dubai is an empty village in the sands of the United Arab Emirates. It stands as a <strong>reminder</strong> of how fast the Middle Eastern country is changing.</p>
<p>Built in the 1970s, the village of al-Ghuraifa was left empty twenty years later. Oil wealth has turned the UAE, home to the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, into an international center of commerce and <strong>tourism</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent years, the empty village near the town of al-Madam in the Sharjah emirate has become more popular with visitors.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A house's entrance gate is buried under the sand at the Bedouin village of al-Ghuraifabout 100 km, 62 miles, southeast of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, Sunday, July 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)</span></div>
<p>The village, made up of two rows of homes and a religious center, "can teach us a lot of the modern history of the UAE," said Ahmad Sukkar of the University of Sharjah. Sukkar is part of a team studying the area.</p>
<p>Al-Ghuraifa was built as part of a public housing project after the 1971 establishment of the United Arab Emirates, a group of seven sheikhdoms. The discovery of oil 13 years earlier was just starting to reshape the country.</p>
<p>The village housed around 100 members of the al-Ketbi tribe, Sukkar said. They were one of several Bedouin groups that until then had led a semi-<strong>nomadic</strong> existence. They raised animals, traveled among the desert <strong>oases</strong> and visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi when they were small towns.</p>
<p>The modern cement houses were built with local details to ease the change to settled life. The inside walls were brightly colored, and some had <strong>mosaics</strong>. The homes also had spaces where village leaders could gather locals for meetings. One house had special paper known as wallpaper showing a land with green plants and trees - a big difference from the sandy environment outside.</p>
<p>It is unclear what exactly caused people to leave just twenty years after the homes were built. Some say that they were driven away by evil spirits. But Sukkar says it is more likely that people left to seek a better life in the UAE's fast-growing cities.</p>
<p>The village had limited electricity and water, and was often hit by sandstorms. Families would have also had to deal with long traveling times across the desert to reach government jobs and schools in Dubai.</p>
<p>Now, the desert is slowly taking back the village. Sand has blown into the homes. Only the religious center, or mosque, remains as it was, thanks to regular cleaning by workers from nearby al-Madam.</p>
<p>Some <strong>descendants</strong> of the camel-mounted Bedouin who once traveled the desert sands still live in the Emirates' rural areas. However, many now live in cities with tall buildings, large shopping centers, and modern roads.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals make up the majority of the UAE's population, and some have taken an interest in its history. It is also a place for them to record music videos and social media posts. On a recent day, groups of visitors walked through the abandoned village.</p>
<p>"I wonder why they left," said Nitin Panchal, an Indian living in the UAE. "Could it be a <strong>genie</strong>," could it be "black magic?" Panchal asked. "We'll never know."</p>
<p>The local government recently installed fencing along with a security gate, waste containers and a parking lot. Officials made the changes because past visitors had caused damage to the village.</p>
<p>The new measures have taken some of the mystery from the village.</p>
<p>Danny Booth is from the Isle of Man, a British Crown Dependency in the Irish Sea. He said he had decided to "come and have a look before things start to change here."</p>
<p>"Sometimes these places are better left<strong> undisturbed</strong>, as they lose their <strong>charm</strong> when they become crowded," he said.</p>

            <title>US Cities Answer Some Emergency Calls with Mental Health Teams  (2023/9/2)</title>

<span class="datetime">01 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Clear Creek County in Colorado is one of the latest places to begin using mental health teams to answer some emergency 911 calls.<br/>
<br/>
Mental health response teams are not new. Many large cities put such teams in place after the killing of George Floyd during his arrest by police in Minneapolis in 2020.<br/>
</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - WellPower clinician Jane Lemaux loads supplies into a STAR van in Denver on Oct. 20, 2022. The STAR program uses clinicians and EMTs or paramedics to respond to nonviolent mental health crises, instead of police.

Some people believe mental health response teams might be more successful in answering some emergency 911 calls than police. The job of a mental health worker is to help people who have emotional problems or mental sickness. The job of the police is to enforce laws. They are not trained to treat mental health conditions.<br/>
<br/>
In Clear Creek County, the case of Christian Glass received a lot of attention. News reports said Glass called the 911 emergency phone number when his car got <strong>stuck</strong> on the roadside. Police answered the call, but Glass refused to get out of his car.<br/>
<br/>
Later, the police broke the car window. Glass threatened them with a small knife. He was then shot and killed by police. The lawyer for Glass's parents said he was having a mental health crisis. He believed that <strong>supernatural</strong> beings meant to harm him.<br/>
<br/>
After legal action, Clear Creak County agreed to pay $19 million as a result of the case and two officers face criminal charges.<p></p>
<p>New York City officials said mental health response teams resolve half of their calls by talking to people or taking them to social services or community health centers. However, the Associated Press (AP) reported that workers for the city's mental health crisis program, called B-HEARD, have had difficulty dealing with the number of calls and cases. The program answered about two percent of the 171,000 calls throughout the city in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Carleigh Sailon was a mental health response team supervisor who used to work in a program in Denver, Colorado. She said mental health teams aim to meet the needs of the community and send the right experts to solve the problems.<br/>
<br/>
Mental health teams may also have more time to spend in response to an emergency call than police. That could be a reason that mental health response teams might be more successful than police in answering some 911 calls.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a mental health team responded to a 911 call about a homeless man in Denver, Colorado. The team spent three hours helping the man get a form of identification, food, and medications. They also took him to a shelter designed to house homeless people. Police might spend 10 to 90 minutes on a call.<br/>
<br/>
This would not be long enough to help a homeless person.<br/>
<br/>
At least 14 of America's 20 biggest cities are using mental health teams to answer some emergency 911 calls. New York City, Los Angeles; Houston, Texas; and Columbus, Ohio, spent almost $125 million on their programs. Smaller cities are also starting to use the teams.<br/>
<br/>
The AP reports that federal government information is incomplete on how effective mental health response teams are. But a recent study of a mental health response program in Denver from Stanford University suggested they have good results. The 2022 study found that, in some Denver neighborhoods where the programs were in place, few small crimes were reported while violent crimes remained unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
At a conference discussing mental health teams in Washington, D.C. this spring, officials from several cities discussed using mental health response teams. They said they faced difficulties in finding enough trained mental health workers, training workers at 911 call centers and sending unarmed civilians into situations that could be dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
However, an official for New York's B-HEARD program believes the effort is important.<br/>
<br/>
Laquisha Grant is with the New York Mayor's Office of Community Mental Health. She said, "We really think that every single B-HEARD response is just a better way that we, the city, are providing care to people."<br/>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">01 September 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "cheers" and "applause."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello VOA Learning English,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-6e7a-08dba9a1a624_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>I am Sina from Iran. I have been learning English with your app for two years. I have a question:</p>
<p>What is the difference between "cheers" and "applause?"</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing to us, Sina.</p>
<p>These two words can mean to express approval or excitement, but the way that these feelings are expressed is a little different.</p>
<p>Cheering uses your voice, and applauding uses your hands to clap and make a sound. But let's look a little closer at each.</p>
<p><em>"I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause, live for the-</em></p>
<p><em>Way that you cheer and<strong> scream</strong> for me</em></p>
<p><em>The applause, applause, applause..." </em></p>
<p>"Applause" is a noun that has two meanings. The first meaning is the approval or excitement marked by clapping hands together. The second meaning is the show of approval through<strong> praise</strong> or vocalizing.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga sang that she lives for the applause of her fans.</p>
<p>"Applaud" is the verb form and also has two meanings. When you applaud something, you are showing your approval or excitement by clapping your hands together. The verb can either take a direct object or not.</p>
<p><em>The crowd applauded the dancers during the show.</em></p>
<p><em>The <strong>audience</strong> applauded after the musical performance.</em></p>
<p>The second meaning of "applaud" is to praise or say that you like or agree with something that a person has done.</p>
<p><em>My professor applauded my work this year.</em></p>
<p>Let's move onto "cheer."</p>
<p>Much like "applaud," "cheer" as a verb means to show approval or excitement by vocalizing or shouting.</p>
<p><em>Parents cheered on their children at the soccer game.</em></p>
<p>To "cheer" also means to perform the act of cheerleading. Cheerleaders are people who lead the crowds at sporting events through cheering and applauding the teams. They encourage their team to win.</p>
<p><em>Kirstin cheered in school for the basketball team.</em></p>
<p>As a verb, "cheer" also means to be cheerful or to make glad or happy. We often use this verb with the preposition "up" in the command, "Cheer up!"</p>
<p><em>You look so unhappy, cheer up!</em></p>
<p><em>He cheered his girlfriend up with flowers.</em></p>
<p>Cheer is also a noun, and its meanings are closely related to the verb form.</p>
<p>"Cheer" is a shout of approval or excitement.</p>
<p><em>The cheers of the crowd grew louder as the football team started winning.</em></p>
<p>"Cheer" is the sport or activity of cheerleading.</p>
<p><em>There are different kinds of shoes needed in cheer depending on what position you are in.</em></p>
<p>"Cheer" also has other meanings as a noun, such as a mood or feeling, gladness or joy, or encouragement.</p>
<p><em>Holidays are a time for good cheer and making memories with family.</em></p>
<p>And we often say "cheers" before eating or drinking at a party or social gathering.</p>
<p><em>Cheers to the happy couple on their wedding day.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Sina.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Climate activists have spray painted a boat, blocked private planes from taking off and covered holes in golf courses over the summer.<br/>
今年夏天，气候活动人士向一艘船泼油漆，阻止私人飞机起飞，并填平了高尔夫球场的球洞。</p>
<p>These actions are part of a campaign against the lifestyles of very rich people who, the activists say, release a lot of carbon pollution into the atmosphere.<br/>
这些行动是反对超级富豪生活方式运动的一部分，活动人士称这些人向大气中释放了大量碳污染。</p>
<p>As flooding, storms, and wildfires take place around the world, climate activists have also turned to new measures to call attention to these bad weather events. Some activists glued themselves to a road in Germany. Others threw soup on a Vincent van Gogh painting in Britain. They caused delays in sporting events including a Formula One Grand Prix racecar competition and the Tour de France bicycle race.<br/>
随着洪水、风暴和野火在世界各地发生，气候活动家也转向了新的措施，以引起人们对这些恶劣天气事件的关注。一些激进分子把自己粘在德国的一条路上。有人在英国向文森特·梵高的画作泼汤。他们导致了包括一级方程式大奖赛和环法自行车赛在内的体育赛事延误。</p>
<p>Now, they are turning their attention to rich people after targeting oil and gas companies and businesses that invest in fossil fuels.<br/>
他们在瞄准石油和天然气公司以及投资化石燃料的企业后，现在又将注意力转向了富豪。</p>
<p>"We do not point the finger at the people but at their lifestyle, the injustice it represents," said Karen Killeen. She was protesting in Ibiza, Spain, a popular summer place for the wealthy.<br/>
克伦·基利恩说：“我们不是把矛头指向这些人，而是指向他们的生活方式以及它所代表的不公正。”她在西班牙的伊维萨岛抗议，那里是富人的避暑胜地。</p>
<p>Killeen and other climate activists spray painted a $300 million boat while holding up a sign that read, "You consume, others suffer." She said she was protesting unnecessary carbon releases such as superrich individuals picking up food by boat. "In a climate emergency, it's an atrocity," she said.<br/>
基利恩和其他气候活动家向一艘价值3亿美元的船泼油漆，同时举着一块牌子，上面写着：“你享受，他人遭罪。”她说她在抗议不必要的碳排放，比如超级富豪乘船吃大餐。她说，“这在气候危机下是一种暴行。”</p>
<p>In Switzerland, about 100 activists chained themselves to aircraft stairs and to an entrance at Europe's biggest private jet sales gathering in Geneva. Another group of activists spray painted a private jet on the island of Sylt in the North Sea. In Spain, activists plugged holes in golf courses to protest the sport's heavy water needs during hot, dry weather.<br/>
在瑞士，大约100名活动人士将自己锁在飞机舷梯上，以及在日内瓦举行的欧洲最大私人飞机展销会的入口处。另一群活动人士在北海的西尔特岛上向一架私人飞机泼油漆。在西班牙，活动人士堵住高尔夫球场的球洞，以抗议这项运动在炎热干燥的天气下对水的大量需求。</p>
<p>In the United States, Abigail Disney of the Disney family was arrested at East Hampton Town Airport in New York, in July along with 13 other protesters. They blocked cars from entering or leaving a parking area. The group also protested at a golf course, a museum event, and outside private homes.<br/>
在美国，迪士尼家族的阿比盖尔·迪士尼与其他13名抗议者于7月在纽约东汉普顿镇机场被捕。他们阻止汽车进出停车场。该组织还在高尔夫球场、博物馆活动和私人住宅外举行抗议。</p>
<p>"Luxury practices are disproportionately contributing to the climate crisis at this point," said American University social scientist Dana Fisher.<br/>
美国大学社会科学家戴纳·费舍尔表示：“目前，奢侈行为对气候危机的影响尤为严重。”。</p>
<p>In a 2021 report, the nonprofit organization Oxfam said the richest one percent of people would be responsible for around 16 percent of emissions by 2030.<br/>
非营利组织乐施会在2021年的一份报告中表示，到2030年，人类最富有1%要对约16%的排放负责。</p>
<p>Richard Wilk is an economic anthropologist at Indiana University. He criticized superyachts: large boats that come with a crew, a helicopter, submarines and swimming pools. Wilk said superyachts release about 6,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is over 1,500 times more than a family car, he said.<br/>
里查德·维尔克是印第安纳大学的经济人类学家。他批评了超级游艇这种配备船员、直升机、潜艇和游泳池的大型游艇。威尔克说，超级游艇每年释放约6400公吨二氧化碳。他说，这是家用汽车的1500多倍。</p>
<p>The environmental group Greenpeace estimated that private aircraft caused about 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution in Europe alone. That is the same as the average yearly CO2 emissions of over half a million people in the European Union.<br/>
绿色和平环保组织估计，私人飞机仅在欧洲就造成了约300万公吨的碳污染。这与欧盟50多万人的年均二氧化碳排放量相同。</p>
<p>But University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann warned not to take attention away from fossil fuel companies. "The solution is to get everyone to use less carbon-based energy," whether wealthy or lower-income people, he said.<br/>
但宾夕法尼亚大学气候科学家迈克尔·曼警告说，不要把注意力从化石燃料公司身上转移开。他说，“解决方案是让每个人都减少使用碳基能源”，无论是富人还是低收入人群。</p>
<p>David Gitman is president of Monarch Air Group, a private airline in Florida. He urged activists to think about whether their actions would bring real change "like sustainable aviation fuel, like carbon offsets."<br/>
大卫·吉特曼是佛罗里达州私人航空公司君主航空集团的总裁。他敦促活动人士思考他们的行动是否会带来真正的改变，“比如可持续的航空燃料，比如碳抵消。”</p>
<p>Gitman added, "Now, if they go out and they spray-paint a private jet in an airport in Europe, is that going to get those results? In my opinion, no."<br/>
吉特曼补充道，“现在，如果他们去欧洲的一个机场向一架私人飞机泼油漆，会得到这种结果吗？在我看来，不会。”</p>
<p>But as protests increase, Wilk said they could still bring changes in behavior.<br/>
但威尔克表示，随着抗议活动的增加，他们仍有可能带来行为的改变。</p>
<p>"Public shaming is one of the most powerful ways of controlling people," Wilk said. "It acts in a lot of different ways to embarrass people, to make them more conscious of the consequences of their actions."<br/>
威尔克说：“公开羞辱是控制人们最有力的方式之一，它以多种不同的方式让人们感到尴尬，让他们更加意识到自己行为的后果。”</p>

<p>Voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri can be helpful when asking about something like the weather. But if you want to save someone's life? Call emergency services for that.</p>
<p>Voice assistants often are not helpful when asked how to perform CPR, a study published Monday found. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR, is an emergency lifesaving process performed when the heart stops beating.</p>
<p>Researchers asked voice assistants eight questions that someone who may need to perform CPR might ask. In answer, the voice assistants said:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man holds an iPhone next to an Amazon Echo, center, and a Google Home, right, in New York on June 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c632eb65-7ee8-4f41-a528-c4ea4234a655_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A man holds an iPhone next to an Amazon Echo, center, and a Google Home, right, in New York on June 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)</span></div>
<p>— "Hmm, I don't know that one."</p>
<p>— "Sorry, I don't understand."</p>
<p>— "Words fail me."</p>
<p>— "Here's an answer ... that I <strong>translated</strong>: The Indian Penal Code."</p>
<p>Only nine of 32 answers suggested calling emergency services for help – an important step suggested by the American Heart Association. The American Heart Association is a nonprofit organization that supports heart medical research.</p>
<p>Some voice assistants sent users to web pages that explained CPR, but only 12 percent of the 32 answers included voiced <strong>instructions</strong>.</p>
<p>Voiced instructions are important because immediate action can save a life, said study co-writer Dr. Adam Landman. He is chief information officer at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>Chest</strong> compressions – pushing down hard and fast on the victim's chest – work best with two hands.</p>
<p>"You can't really be <strong>glued</strong> to a phone if you're trying to provide CPR," Landman said.</p>
<p>The study was published in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Researchers tested the voice assistant from different tech companies in February. They included Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana. They asked questions such as "How do I perform CPR?" and "What do you do if someone does not have a <strong>pulse</strong>?"</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, better questions meant better answers. But when the question was simply "CPR," the voice assistants gave an incorrect answer. One played news from a public radio station. Another gave information about a movie called "CPR." A third gave the address of a local CPR training business.</p>
<p>ChatGPT from OpenAI, a free web-based <strong>chatbot</strong>, performed better on the test. It provided more helpful information. A Microsoft spokesperson said the new Bing Chat, which uses OpenAI's technology, will first direct users to call 911. It will then give simple steps when asked how to perform CPR.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong> CPR instructions are needed across all voice assistant devices, Landman said. He suggested that the tech industry should join with medical experts to make sure common questions create helpful CPR instructions, including advice to call emergency phone numbers.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said the company recognizes the importance of working with the medical community and is "always working to get better." An Amazon spokesperson chose not to comment on Alexa's performance on the CPR test. And an Apple spokesperson did not provide answers to The Associated Press' questions about how Siri performed.</p>

            <title>Support Grows for Bioeconomy in Amazon  (2023/9/1)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">31 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Brazil's Amazon rainforest has long been home to small and mid-sized <strong>sustainable</strong> businesses. These companies use the area's nuts, fruits and other materials.</p>
<p>Now there is a push to increase the number of those businesses. And a new term has come about to describe these kinds of businesses: "bioeconomy."</p>
<p>Marcelo Salazar has a drink company called Mazo Mana Forest Food. The business partners with communities that live from the forest and gather the nuts, cocoa beans, acai, mushrooms, fruits and other ingredients that go into the drinks. They have received financial support from an investment group in Manaus, Brazil. The hope is that the bioeconomy counters an economy based on forestry and ranching.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="ARCHIVE - View of the forest on Combu Island on the banks of the Guam&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;225; River, near Bel&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;233;m, Par&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;225;, Brazil, August 6, 2023.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, Archive)</span></div>
<p>Leaders from Amazon countries used and heard the term repeatedly at an August meeting in Belem. The officials expressed interest for policies to protect the rainforest and provide paying work for tens of millions who live in it.</p>
<p>However, beyond general support for the idea, there was little agreement about what exactly a bioeconomy should look like. Salazar was on a team chosen by Brazil's environment ministry to speak about the subject.</p>
<p>The idea is not new. It is the latest term for sustainable development, also called the green economy.</p>
<p>Besides the Brazil nuts and acai harvesters, people are making chocolate from native cocoa. There is a sustainable fishery for one of the world's largest freshwater fish. A community of rubber gatherers is helping produce shoes.</p>
<p>"The challenge is <strong>scale</strong>," Para state Governor Helder Barbalho said. His state is believed to be the only in Brazil that has a complete bioeconomy plan. Para is Brazil's top producer of acai, yet its economy is far more dependent on iron ore exports to China. A large amount of land in Para is used by an estimated 27 million farm cows. The state emits more <strong>greenhouse gases</strong> than any Amazon country besides Brazil.</p>
<p>But when it comes to larger sustainable companies, there are few success stories. The best example has been skin product company Natura. Twenty years ago it started a product line using ingredients from traditional Amazon communities and family farms.</p>
<p>When the company started, local people were using ucuuba trees to make <strong>brooms</strong>. They greatly increased their earnings by leaving the trees standing and selling the seeds to Natura. The change helped conserve more than 2 million hectares of forest.</p>
<p>Natura bought goods from 41 communities – home to 9,120 families – who in 2022 received about $9 million.</p>
<p>Para State's plan for the bioeconomy names 43 forest products that could be exported, including acai, cocoa, cassava, pepper, fish species and essential oils for skin products.</p>
<p>And the neighboring Amazonas state is creating a bioeconomy plan with financial support from the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>But some earlier efforts reveal problems.</p>
<p>A state <strong>condom</strong> factory in the Amazon city of Xapuri opened in 2008. It was supposed to provide a market for hundreds of rubber-gathering families. But the factory closed 10 years later, after federal funding came to an end. Locals resorted to cattle ranching and today the area ranks high for deforestation.</p>
<p>Cocoa beans have also caused problems. The trees can be a way to let forest grow back where it has been cut down. But its appeal in places like the Ivory Coast and Ghana has meant massive deforestation to make way for the trees that earn more money.</p>
<p>Salazar, head of Mazo Mana, views his company as both social-minded and good for the economy. It keeps nearly 10 percent of its money for its partner community associations.</p>
<p>Salazar thinks the sustainable companies that succeed and grow big will be those with a mission to solve the Amazon's problems. He says those companies will drive an economy that sees the value of the forest.</p>

In today's Everyday Grammar, we finish our discussion of Fallout Boy's remake of the song We Didn't Start the Fire, which was written and performed by Billy Joel.

The new version of the song lists historical events from 1989 to the present, but the chorus is the same as Billy Joel's 1989 version. Today, we will look at verbal tenses in that part of the song.

Lyrics and the meaning

Everyday Grammar: More Tenses in "We Didn't Start the Fire"
Everyday Grammar: More Tenses in "We Didn't Start the Fire"
We didn't start the fire

It was always burning since the world's been turning

We didn't start the fire

No, we didn't light it but we're trying to fight it

The "fire" can be understood as bad things happening in the world. The song is talking about how bad things have existed throughout history and that one generation is not responsible for all of them. Joel was saying that his generation was doing its best to help by trying to fight "the fire."

Let's move on to verbal tenses in the chorus.

Verbal tenses in the chorus

In the chorus, the simple past tense in the negative is used in the 1st person plural or "we" form.

To form the negative simple past, we use:

Subject + did + not + base verb + the rest of the sentence.

In the song, the contraction of "did not" is used, "didn't."

We didn't start the fire.

No, we didn't light it...

Next, we see the past continuous tense in the 3rd person singular form. The past continuous is used to talk about ongoing things that happened in the past.

It was always burning...

To form the past continuous, we use:

Subject + past tense form of be (was or were) + base verb and present participle (-ing ending) + the rest of the sentence

It was always burning since the world's been turning.

In the second half of that sentence, we have a clause starting with "since" in the present perfect continuous. The present perfect continuous is used to talk about things that started in the past and are continuing today.

To form the present perfect continuous, we use:

Subject + has been or have been + base verb and present participle (-ing ending) + the rest of the sentence or clause

...since the world has been turning...

The contraction form is used in the song. In everyday English "has" sometimes appears as apostrophe "s" (‘s).

...since the world's been turning...

And lastly, we see the present continuous tense used in the second half of the last line of the chorus. It is in the first person plural using "we" in a contraction with "are."

No, we didn't light it, but we're trying to fight it

The present continuous tense is used to talk about actions that are happening now, occurring often and may continue into the future.

To form the present continuous, we use:

Subject + be (am, is, are) + base verb and present participle (-ing ending) +the rest of the sentence.

In the final chorus of the song, there is a conditional statement:

But when we are gone,

It will still go on...

This is a type one or first conditional. This type of conditional is used to talk about future situations that are possible or real.

The structure of type one conditionals is:

If or when + present simple tense verb, will + infinitive verb.

The word "gone" is a past participle adjective. This sentence means that the world will continue when this generation is no more.

Final thoughts

In today's Everyday Grammar, we closely examined other verbal tenses in the chorus of the song We Didn't Start the Fire. There were the past and present continuous tenses, the present perfect continuous and the simple past tense. We even talked about first conditional statements. Next time you are listening to a song, try to see which tenses are used or if there are any conditional statements.

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/google-launches-watermark-tool-to-identify-ai-created-images.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Google has launched a tool designed to mark identity on images created by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.<br/>
谷歌推出了一款工具，旨在给人工智能生成的图像标记身份。</p>
<p>The American-based search engine and online advertising company announced the new tool in a statement Tuesday. Google has already made the system available to a limited number of beta testers. Google plans to expand its use in the future.<br/>
这家总部位于美国的搜索引擎和网络广告公司周二在一份声明中宣布了这一新工具。谷歌已经向数量有限的测试人员提供了该系统。谷歌计划在未来扩大其使用范围。</p>
<p>A team at Google Deep Mind developed the tool, called SynthID, in partnership with Google Research. SynthID is designed to work with Google's AI image creator Imagen. That system creates full film-quality images from simple text commands. For now, only Imagen users will be able to use the AI identifying tool.<br/>
谷歌Deep Mind的一个团队与谷歌研究院合作开发了这款名为SynthID的工具。SynthID旨在与谷歌旗下的人工智能图像生成器Imagen搭配使用。该系统可以通过简单的文本命令生成全胶片质量的图像。目前，只有Imagen用户才能使用这款人工智能识别工具。</p>
<p>SynthID works by creating a hidden, digital "watermark" on images. Watermarks have long been used with paper documents and money as a way to mark them as being real, or authentic. With this method, paper can be held up to a light to see if a watermark exists and the document is authentic.<br/>
SynthID的工作原理是在图像上创建一个隐藏的数字水印。水印长期以来一直被用于纸质文件和货币，作为将其标记为真实的一种方式。使用这种方法，可以将纸张举到灯光下，查看水印是否存在以及文档是否真实。</p>
<p>A digital watermark serves the same purpose. But it uses technology to digitally embed hidden markers in images. These watermarks are hard to see by just looking at an image. Instead, special tools are needed to identify the watermark.<br/>
数字水印也有同样的作用。但它是使用技术在图像中数字化嵌入隐藏的标记。肉眼很难看到这些水印。相反，识别这种水印需要特殊的工具。</p>
<p>Google says the digital watermark is designed to help individuals and companies identify whether an image has been created by AI tools or not. This could help people recognize inauthentic pictures published online and also protect copyright-protected images.<br/>
谷歌表示，数字水印旨在帮助个人和公司识别图像是否由人工智能工具生成。这可以帮助人们识别网上发布的不真实图片，也可以保护受版权保护的图片。</p>
<p>Technology experts have identified these issues as two of the biggest problems with AI creation tools – they can increase the amount of misinformation online and they can violate copyrights.<br/>
技术专家认为这是人工智能创作工具的两个最大问题——它们可能会增加网上错误信息的数量，也可能侵犯版权。</p>
<p>Last month, Google's parent Alphabet joined other major technology companies in agreeing to establish watermark tools to help make AI technology safer.<br/>
上个月，谷歌母公司Alphabet与其他大型科技公司一道，同意创建水印工具，以帮助提高人工智能技术的安全性。</p>
<p>The companies – including Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft-backed AI developer OpenAI and online seller Amazon – made the agreement during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. They promised to fully develop and test watermarking tools for content including text, audio and video.<br/>
包括脸书母公司Meta、微软支持的人工智能开发商OpenAI以及网上卖家亚马逊在内的这些公司在白宫与美国总统乔·拜登会面时达成了协议。他们承诺将全面开发和测试文本、音频和视频等内容的水印工具。</p>
<p>Google said its system embeds a digital watermark directly into the details of an image. The tool can be used for "connecting people with high-quality information and upholding trust between creators and users across society."<br/>
谷歌表示，其系统将数字水印直接嵌入图像的细节中。该工具可用于“将人们与高质量的信息联系起来，维护全社会创作者和用户之间的信任”。</p>
<p>Developers of the SynthID system said it is built to keep the watermark in place even if the image itself is changed by creative tools designed to resize pictures or add additional light or color.<br/>
SynthID系统的开发人员表示，即使图像本身被设计用于调整图片大小或添加额外光线或颜色的创造性工具更改，它也能保持水印不消失。</p>
<p>The tool can add a hidden watermark to AI-produced images created by Imagen. SynthID can also examine an image to find a digital watermark that was embedded with the Imagen system.<br/>
该工具可以为Imagen生成的人工智能图像添加隐藏水印。SynthID还可以检查图像，找出Imagen系统所嵌入的数字水印。</p>
<p>Google says it will continue to test the watermarking tool and hopes to collect many user experiences from the current beta testers. And the company looks forward to adding the system to other Google products and making it available to more individuals and organizations.<br/>
谷歌表示，它将继续测试这款水印工具，并希望从目前的测试人员那里收集到许多用户体验。该公司期待着将该系统添加到谷歌的其他产品中，并将其提供给更多的个人和组织。</p>
<p>In addition to SynthID, Google also announced Tuesday the launch of additional AI tools designed for businesses and structural improvements to its computing systems. Those systems are used to produce AI tools, also known as large language models.<br/>
除了SynthID，谷歌周二还宣布推出更多为企业设计的人工智能工具，并对其计算系统进行结构改进。这些系统用于生成也称为大型语言模型的人工智能工具。</p>
<p>Google made public a new version of its self-designed AI computing chips. The company says the new chip, called TPU v5e, was built to train large computer models, but also more effectively serve those models. Google also released new versions of software and security tools designed to work with AI systems.<br/>
谷歌公开了其自行设计的新版人工智能计算芯片。该公司表示，这款名为TPU v5e的新芯片旨在训练大型计算机模型，但也能更有效地为这些模型服务。谷歌还发布了新版本的软件和安全工具，旨在与人工智能系统配合使用。</p>

            <title>Climate Change Has Sweden Growing its Wine Industry  (2023/8/31)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">30 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Most people would not connect the country of Sweden with the tradition of fine <strong>wine</strong> making. It is far north of the famous wine-growing areas in France, Italy or Spain, where the tradition is ancient.</p>
<p>However, climate change is making for warmer and longer growing seasons in Sweden. There are also new kinds of <strong>grapes</strong> created especially for the country's environment.</p>
<p>As a result, winemaking is a growing industry.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A tractor works at Kullabergs Ving&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;229;rd, in Nyhamnsl&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;228;ge, Sweden, Tuesday, July 25, 2023.

<p>Its growth comes as drought, rising heat and other extreme weather are forcing traditional winemaking areas to re-think their growing methods.</p>
<p>The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute reports temperatures in the country's south have increased by about 2 degrees Celsius over the past 30 years compared to the 30 years earlier. The experts also say Sweden's growing season has lengthened by about 20 days.</p>
<p>Felix <i></i>197;hrberg is the chief oenologist, or expert winemaker, at the 14-hectare Kullabergs Vingard, near the North Sea.</p>
<p>He noted that the rising temperatures are hurting vineyards in traditional winemaking countries. At the same time, "we are gaining <strong>momentum</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Kullabergs produces about 30,000 bottles of wine yearly. Some of their wines have won prizes in different competitions. Costly restaurants from Hong Kong to Europe sell the wine.</p>
<p>Even some oenologists from France are settling in Sweden to grow grapes and careers.</p>
<p>"It is the new <strong>frontier</strong> of wine making and grapes grow best on their coolest frontier," <i></i>197;hrberg said.</p>
<p>Emma Berto is one such winemaker from France who now works at Thora Vingard, about 20 kilometers from <i></i>197;hrberg's land.</p>
<p>She and her partner, Romain Chichery, moved to Sweden for the chance to lead a vineyard just after completing their education. They say Sweden's climate is more predictable than France's. There, the early spring weather can be too warm and the grapes begin to develop before they should.</p>
<p>In addition, Berto and Chichery said they want to use more <strong>sustainable</strong> grape-growing methods, including limits on insect poisoning.</p>
<p>Chichery said France has been making wine for so long, there are many rules winemakers must follow. In Sweden, it is a newer business so there is more freedom.</p>
<p>However, there is still a lot to learn about growing grapes in Sweden. The main grape grown in the country is Solaris, which began in Germany, and grows well in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>The winemakers treat the vines differently, too. In Sweden, the leaves are removed from the vines so the grapes can receive more sunlight. In France and Spain, sometimes winemakers are worried the grapes will get too much.</p>
<p>The Thora owners who hired the French winemakers are Johan and Heather Oberg. They depend on wine experts from the traditional winemaking countries because Swedish universities do not have study programs in the science and <strong>practice</strong> of winemaking.</p>
<p>Maarten van Aalst is a climate professor at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. He said businesses are often first to identify and react<strong> </strong>to climate change. He said it is good that "climate change is partly something we can <strong>adapt</strong> to."</p>
<p>But, he warned, it is not all good weather in Sweden. He pointed to recent heavy rains that caused flooding, resulting in $150 million in damage. He said bad weather is becoming more common because of human-caused climate change.</p>
<p>In Sweden, vineyards account for about 150 hectares of land. The number is one million in Spain and about 800,000 in France.</p>
<p>Swedish winemakers hope that as the industry grows, the government will make rules that help them expand their businesses. For example, right now in Sweden, wine makers cannot sell their own wine. People who want a bottle must purchase from a government-run store.</p>
<p>Mikael Molstad writes about wine. He said the Swedish government is not in favor of making it easier to buy alcohol.</p>
<p>"Politicians," he said, "still see alcohol as a social problem."</p>
<p>Goran Amneg<i></i>229;rd is a prize-winning winemaker who started 20 years ago. He is pleased to see more wineries opening in Sweden.</p>
<p>He thinks more people will come to take advantage of the warmer temperatures and longer growing time.</p>
<p>"I can see things growing here that were unthinkable 30 or 40 years ago," Amneg<i></i>229;rd said as he looked out over his small vineyard.</p>
<p>"We're seeing fruit trees like peaches and apricots. I'm getting beautiful peaches in August."</p>

<p>Military officers in oil-producing Gabon said they had seized power on Wednesday and had put President Ali Bongo under house arrest. The military seized control minutes after the Central African state's election body announced he had won a third term.</p>
<p>The officers said they represented the armed forces. They said on television that the election results were canceled. They also said the borders were closed and state <strong>institutions</strong> had broken up. The military takeover took place after a vote that was set to extend the Bongo family's 50-plus years in power.</p>
<p>The Gabon officers call themselves The Committee of Transition and the Restoration of Institutions. They said the country faced "a severe institutional, political, economic, and social crisis." They said the August 26 vote was not <strong>credible</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This video grab shows soldiers speaking on state television as they announce that they had seized power in Libreville, Wednesday Aug. 30, 2023.

</span></div>
<p>One of the officers is Brice Oligui Nguema. In a video he appeared to be the military's leader. He told French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> that he and other generals would meet on Wednesday to select someone to head the <strong>transitional</strong> government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people celebrated the military's intervention on the streets of Libreville, the Gabonese capital.</p>
<p>The officers said they had detained Bongo, who took over in 2009. Before that, his father Omar, had ruled Gabon since 1967. The officer also said they had arrested the president's son and others for corruption and treason.</p>
<p>Opponents say the family has done little to share the state's oil and mining wealth with its 2.3 million people. Violent unrest broke out after Bongo's disputed 2016 election win. There was a failed <strong>coup</strong> attempt in 2019.</p>
<p>The 64-year-old Bongo was last seen in public voting on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>French Condemnation</strong></p>
<p>France, Gabon's former colonial ruler, condemned the takeover. France has troops in the country.</p>
<p>"We condemn the military coup and recall our commitment to free and <strong>transparent</strong> elections," French government spokesman Olivier Veran said.</p>
<p>The coup creates more uncertainty for France's presence in the area. France has about 350 troops in Gabon. Its forces have been kicked out of Mali and Burkina Faso after coups there in the last two years.</p>
<p>The African Union's Peace and Security Council chair called for a meeting on the situation with Burundi, Senegal and Cameroon. China called for a peaceful resolution and Russia said it hoped for a quick return to <strong>stability</strong>.</p>
<p>Rukmini Sanya is an expert at the Economist Intelligence Unit. He said, "Mr. Bongo is not expected to be able to suppress the uprising." He said there was "widespread public discontent" against Bongo, his family and his ruling party.</p>
<p>Gabon produces about 200,000 barrels of oil a day. International companies include France's TotalEnergies and Anglo-French producer Perenco. French miner Eramet said it had halted operations in Gabon.</p>
<p>There were concerns about <strong>transparency</strong> regarding Saturday's vote. During the election, there was a lack of international observers and some foreign broadcasts were suspended. The government also cut internet service and put in place a nighttime curfew. On Wednesday, internet access appeared to be in place for the first time since the election.</p>
<p>Shortly before the coup, the election body had declared Bongo the election winner with 64.3 percent of the vote. His main opponent, Albert Ondo Ossa, received 30.8 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Hurricane Idalia made <strong>landfall</strong> on the west coast of the American state of Florida on Wednesday. Officials said the dangerous storm brought life-threatening <strong>storm surges</strong> and flooding to the area.</p>
<p>By early Wednesday morning, more than 200,000 people reportedly were without electricity as strong winds brought down trees and power lines. Along the coast, some homes were underwater, and structures were crushed in the storm surge.</p>
<p>"We have multiple trees down, <strong>debris</strong> in the roads, do not come," emergency officials in Cedar Key said. They said most of the streets around the downtown area were underwater.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Members of the Tampa Fire Rescue Dept., remove a street pole brought down during Hurricane Idalia Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023, in Tampa, Florida. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-b673-08dba97f9a2f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Members of the Tampa Fire Rescue Dept., remove a street pole brought down during Hurricane Idalia Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023, in Tampa, Florida. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)</span></div>
<p>Idalia landed in a lightly populated area near Keaton Beach at 11:45 UTC. The Category 3 hurricane came with <strong>sustained</strong> wind speeds as high as 205 kilometers per hour. The National Weather Service places hurricanes into five groups depending on wind speed. The strongest level, a Category 5 hurricane, can reach sustained wind speeds of 252 kilometers an hour or higher.</p>
<p>People who live along Florida's northwest coast had been ordered to leave the area before Idalia's arrival. On Wednesday morning, Governor Ron DeSantis told those who have not left to stay inside until the storm passes. He said, "Don't put your life at risk."</p>
<p><strong>A full moon could raise tides higher</strong></p>
<p>As the hurricane continues, a rare full moon, called a supermoon, could cause <strong>tides</strong> to rise higher than normal along Florida's coast.</p>
<p>When the moon is full, the sun and the moon are pulling in the same direction. This has the effect of increasing tides above normal, said Kerry Emanuel. He is an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The moon's gravitational pull is stronger when it is closer to the Earth, so the tides could be higher. Wednesday's supermoon is the closest to the Earth this year.</p>
<p>Brian Haines is head of the National Weather Service office in Charleston, South Carolina. He said, "I would say the timing is pretty bad for this one."</p>
<p>The storm surge is often the most dangerous event when a hurricane strikes. The National Hurricane Center estimated on Tuesday that ocean water levels could increase by 4.6 meters along parts of Florida's west coast. Farther south, a storm surge of up to 2.1 meters is expected in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
<p>Hurricanes get their energy from warm water. Idalia is feeding from warm water around Florida.</p>
<p>Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach called the water temperature of 31-32 degrees "rocket fuel for the storm." He added, "It's basically all systems go for the storm to intensify."</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Tallahassee called Idalia "an <strong>unprecedented</strong> event" since no major hurricanes on record have ever passed through the area around Big Bend. The state of Florida, however, is still dealing with damage from Ian, a Category 5 hurricane, last year. Ian was responsible for almost 150 deaths and damaged 52,000 structures.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said the 2023 hurricane season would be far more active because of extremely warm ocean temperatures. The season runs through November, with most storms taking place in August and September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A new environmental report says rising air pollution across South Asia can cut life expectancy rates by up to five years.<br/>
一份新的环境报告称，南亚各地日益严重的空气污染可能会使预期寿命缩短五年。</p>
<p>South Asia includes the world's most polluted countries, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. The area accounts for more than half of the total lives lost worldwide to pollution, the Energy Policy Institute said in its latest Air Quality Life Index. The institute is part of the University of Chicago.<br/>
南亚囊括了全球污染最严重的国家：印度、孟加拉国、尼泊尔和巴基斯坦。美国能源政策研究所在最新的空气质量生命指数中表示，该地区占全球因污染致死总人数的一半以上。该研究所隶属于芝加哥大学。</p>
<p>The report blames the air pollution dangers on fast industrialization and population growth across South Asia. Researchers estimate the area currently has particle pollution rates that are 50 percent higher than at the start of the century.<br/>
该报告将这种空气污染威胁归咎于南亚的快速工业化和人口增长。研究人员估计，该地区目前的颗粒物污染率比本世纪初高出50%。</p>
<p>Individuals living in Bangladesh, the world's most polluted country, stand to lose 6.8 years of life on average per person, the report found. This compares to 3.6 months in the United States. The information is based on satellite data used to estimate the effects of increased airborne fine particles on life expectancy.<br/>
报告发现，生活在孟加拉国这个全球污染最严重国家的个人平均每人将减寿6.8年。相比之下，美国为3.6个月。这些信息是基于用于估算空气中细颗粒物增加对预期寿命影响的卫星数据。</p>
<p>The report said India has been responsible for about 59 percent of the world's increase in pollution since 2013. In densely populated New Delhi, the world's most polluted large city, the average life expectancy had dropped by more than 10 years.<br/>
报告称，自2013年以来，印度占到了全球污染增长的59%左右。人口稠密的新德里作为全球污染最严重的大城市，平均预期寿命下降了10年以上。</p>
<p>The report called for cuts in worldwide levels of lung-harming airborne particles to levels sought by the World Health Organization (WHO). If these cuts were reached, it could raise average life expectancy rates by 2.3 years.<br/>
该报告呼吁将全球危害肺部的空气颗粒物水平降至世界卫生组织要求的水平。如果实现这些削减，平均预期寿命可能会提高2.3年。</p>
<p>A person living in Pakistan would gain 3.9 years from meeting WHO pollution guidelines, the report added. And in Nepal, a person would live 4.6 years longer if the guidelines were met.<br/>
报告补充道，如果达到世卫组织污染指导方针的标准，巴基斯坦人民的寿命将因此延长3.9年。如果尼泊尔符合该指导方针，个人寿命将延长4.6年。</p>
<p>The report noted that China has worked to reduce pollution by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. The researchers said this shows the need for governments to produce and share air quality data to help reduce inequalities in getting tools to fight pollution.<br/>
报告指出，中国在2013年至2021年间努力将污染降低了42.3%。研究人员表示，这表明政府有必要编制和发布空气质量数据，以帮助减少在获得对抗污染工具方面的不平等。</p>

<p>Researchers, using information gathered by satellites, say the loss of ice in Antarctica hurts the survival chances of rare seabirds.</p>
<p>The large flightless birds are called emperor penguins. They raise their young in groups, or colonies, on ice that forms around the continent. The ice partly melts during the summer months.</p>
<p>The British and French researchers studied satellite images to look at five breeding colonies of the birds in the area of the Bellingshausen Sea in 2022.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Emperor penguin chicks in Antarctica on Dec. 21, 2005. The loss of ice in Antarctica likely resulted in none of the emperor penguin chicks surviving in four colonies in that area.

<p>They said the images showed no sea ice was left in December during the Southern Hemisphere's summer. This also happened in 2021, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>The scientists said four of the five colonies they studied had been affected by early sea ice loss.</p>
<p>Emperor penguin <strong>chicks </strong>are born on the ice in Antarctica that forms during the winter there. The ice is important because penguin chicks do not develop waterproof feathers for one to two months after they are born.</p>
<p>Peter Fretwell is a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey who helped write the study. He said, "If the sea ice breaks up under them, the young chicks will drown."</p>
<p>The scientists published their research in the<strong> journal </strong><em>Communications Earth &amp; Environmen</em>t.</p>
<p>Fretwell's team also started a study of places where the penguins make their nests across Antarctica. They were able to identify the nesting places in satellite images because the birds' waste is darker than the surrounding snow. The scientists estimate that there are 300,000 <strong>breeding pairs </strong>of emperor penguins in Antarctica. The birds are the world's largest penguin.</p>
<p>Fretwell told the Associated Press that 30 percent of the 62 known penguin colonies were hurt by low levels of sea ice. He said 13 colonies likely failed.</p>
<p>Daniel Zitterbart studies Antarctica at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the state of Massachusetts. He was not involved in the study. But Zitterbart said he was not surprised by the results of the penguin study.</p>
<p>He said that, if penguins are not successful breeding in one place, they might look for another place next year. The population could recover.</p>
<p>But Zitterbart noted, "If you look further out <strong>down the line</strong>, how many <strong>suitable</strong> places will be left?"</p>

<p>A brain doctor in Australia received a huge surprise during an operation on a patient's brain last year:</p>
<p>"Gosh, what is that, it's moving. Take it out of my hands."</p>
<p>That is what Australian neurosurgeon Hari Priya Bandi said about finding a <strong>worm</strong>, or <strong>parasite</strong>, last year in a patient's brain.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated photo supplied by Canberra Health Services, shows a parasite in a specimen jar at a Canberra hospital in Australia. A neurosurgeon investigating a patient's mystery neurological symptoms pulled the worm from her brain. (Canberra Health Services via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/28076095-2206-4f21-b3df-3ddafd922035_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This undated photo supplied by Canberra Health Services, shows a parasite in a specimen jar at a Canberra hospital in Australia. A neurosurgeon investigating a patient's mystery neurological symptoms pulled the worm from her brain. (Canberra Health Services via AP)</span></div>
<p>Bandi was looking for the unexplained cause of <strong>symptoms</strong> in a 64-year-old woman.</p>
<p>She found the cause after drilling a small hole in the woman's skull and looking at her brain. Bandi performed the operation at Canberra Hospital in 2022. She discussed the discovery this week after publishing a study with Dr. Sanjaya Senanayake in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>
<p>The doctors said the worm was a roundworm native to Australia. It was about eight centimeters. Before the discovery, it was not known to affect humans. The worms are often found in carpet pythons, a kind of large snake found in Australia and on some Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Senanayake was on duty at the hospital last year when the worm was found.</p>
<p>"I got a call saying: ‘We've just removed a live worm from this patient's brain,'" he said.</p>
<p>The woman started medical treatment earlier in 2022 after saying she was experiencing depression and forgetfulness. Brain images showed changes over a three-month period.</p>
<p>Bandi's investigation was expected to show an infection or a cancerous <strong>tumor</strong>. Instead, she found the worm.</p>
<p>"Everyone in that operating theater was absolutely <strong>stunned</strong>," Senanayake said of the "<strong>wriggling</strong>" thing.</p>
<p>Before the operation, the patient had come to a hospital in New South Wales with stomach sickness, pain, and <strong>sweats</strong> at night.</p>
<p>Bandi said the patient did not show any problems from the worm removal. Her mental health is improving, too, but some problems continue.</p>
<p>"She was so <strong>grateful</strong> to have an answer for what has been causing her trouble for so very long," Bandi said. The patient has not been back to the hospital. Doctors gave her some medicine to kill parasites. Bandi said the doctors are continuing to watch the patient's overall health.</p>
<p>"We're keeping a close eye on her," Senanayake told an Australian broadcaster.</p>
<p>The doctors believe the woman may have accidentally eaten the worm's eggs. She lives in the same area as the carpet python. The python <strong>sheds</strong> the worms and their eggs in its waste. They believe it is possible that the woman gathered some native plants to eat, and they had the worm's eggs on them.</p>

<p>When talking about literacy, comprehension means understanding what we read. On the website Reading Rockets, literacy experts say: "To be able to accurately understand written material, children need to be able to (1) <strong>decode</strong> what they read; (2) make connections between what they read and what they already know; and (3) think deeply about what they have read."</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for comprehension</strong></p>
<p>Ways of teaching are sometimes called strategies. Comprehension strategies should do some of the following:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Comprehension" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-54a3-08db93831bf9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Comprehension</span></div>
<ul>
<li>Teach students what they understand and what they do not.</li>
<li>Teach the structure of a story – beginning, middle, and end.</li>
<li>Teach students to re-tell a story or parts of a story.</li>
<li>Teach students to ask questions about a text.</li>
<li>Use visual organizers such as Word Walls and Story Maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experts at Reading Rockets say teachers can show students the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to guess what is going to happen in a story.</li>
<li>How to re-tell a story in their own words.</li>
<li>How to use new lesson words often and in different ways.</li>
<li>How to ask themselves questions about a text as they read.</li>
</ul>
<p>These experts also suggest ways students can help themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>A child can use visual aids such as outlines and maps.</li>
<li>They can read with a friend and take turns <strong>summarizing</strong>.</li>
<li>As they read, they can ask themselves questions about it.</li>
<li>They can make mental pictures of the story. This strategy is called <strong>visualization</strong> or a "mind movie."</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents can talk about words, stories, and books with their children. Parents can also make connections between a child's experiences and what they read in a book.</p>
<p><u>Strategy: Story Map (a visual aid)</u></p>
<p>Story maps allow students to learn the story in a visual way. Students must read carefully to fill in the map. Story maps also may be used for math, social studies, and science.</p>
<p>There are different types of story maps. The most basic ones focus on the beginning, the middle, and the end of the story. More advanced story maps are about other story elements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>characters</li>
<li>setting</li>
<li>problem</li>
<li>solution</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Strategy: Active Reading </u></p>
<p>As you read a book to a child, talk about the story. This strategy turns a book into a lively conversation. Do not stop too much. If you do, the students may not understand the story. Keep it fun.</p>
<p>Ask questions about the story. This will help the child get more involved in the story. For early learners, ask easy questions. You can point to a picture in the book and ask, "What is this?" For more advanced learners, you can ask more difficult questions. For example, "What does this character want?"</p>
<p>When a student answers, give them feedback. "That's right! The character is sad because he is lost." Add to what the student said. "I was lost one time. And I felt really scared."</p>
<p><u>Strategy: Sequence</u></p>
<p>Putting events in the correct order (or <strong>sequence</strong>) is a great way to understand a story.</p>
<p>Why teach sequencing?</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps students of all levels to organize information. With beginning learners, you can use pictures too.</li>
<li>It teaches the structure of a story: beginning, middle, and end.</li>
<li>This strategy also tests a student's ability to re-tell a story in order or to summarize<strong> </strong>it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This strategy can be used with many kinds of writing. Students can sequence parts of a story or lines from a song or a poem. They can even sequence everyday activities - a math problem, or a <strong>recipe</strong> for making their favorite dish. Simply write or draw the text of a story or steps in a process. Then have students put the steps in order.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for comprehension</strong></p>
<p>There are many types of reading comprehension assessments. Generally speaking, if a learner cannot do the following, they may have a problem with comprehension.</p>
<ul>
<li>They cannot tell you the main idea.</li>
<li>They cannot describe the characters or setting.</li>
<li>They cannot explain a character's thoughts or feelings.</li>
<li>They cannot connect a story to real life.</li>
<li>They can tell you what happened in a story but not why.</li>
<li>They cannot re-tell the story in their own words.</li>
<li>They cannot tell the events of the story in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from testing and assessment, experts suggest that teachers, parents, and caregivers should pay attention to the skills of describing, explaining, and connecting while reading with a child.</p>
<p>Experts add that adults should pay attention to what a child says. Comprehension may be a problem if a child says, "I couldn't follow the story," or simply, "I don't get it!"</p>
<p>Use these tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve you and your learners. Change them to fit your students and teaching situation.</p>

<p>Octopuses are not communal animals. Most live alone their entire lives.</p>
<p>So, scientists were surprised to find thousands of pearl octopuses living together as they protected their developing eggs. The community is on the ocean floor off the California coast.</p>
<p>Now, researchers may have solved the mystery of the strange pearl octopus behavior.</p><div class="contentImage"><img a="" alt="FILE - This 2019 image from video provided by MBARI shows female pearl octopuses nesting at the " ap="" approximately="" at="" california="" coast="" davidson="" depth="" garden="" meters.="" near="" octopus="" of="" off="" seamount="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9f089725-ea39-40a5-a885-c935cbdad3ce_w268_r1.jpg" the="" via=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This 2019 image from video provided by MBARI shows female pearl octopuses nesting at the "octopus garden" near the Davidson Seamount off the California coast at a depth of approximately 3,200 meters. (MBARI via AP)</span></div>
<p>An inactive underwater volcano heats the area where the mother octopuses settle. Their eggs <strong>hatch </strong>faster as a result.</p>
<p>"There are clear <strong>advantages </strong>of basically sitting in this natural hot tub," said Janet Voight. Voight is an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. She co-wrote the study published in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://apnews.com/article/www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3247" target="_blank">Science Advances</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the area's warmth greatly reduced the time it took for eggs to hatch. As a result, the eggs had a reduced risk of being eaten by snails, shrimp and other animals.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered the <strong>nesting</strong> area in 2018, calling it an "octopus garden."</p>
<p>Researchers used a robotic underwater vehicle to film the group of nearly 6,000 octopuses living around 3 kilometers deep.</p>
<p>The octopuses lay their eggs on warm rocks and then remain there, protecting their young with their bodies.</p>
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist Andrew DeVogelaere was a study co-writer. He described what researchers saw: "It was completely<strong> incredible</strong> – we suddenly saw thousands of pearly-colored octopus, all upside down, with their legs up in the air and moving around."</p>
<p>The octopus were pushing away possible predators and turning their eggs for an even flow of water and oxygen, he explained.</p>
<p>But scientists still did not know exactly why the octopuses had gathered there.</p>
<p>Scientists observed the area for three years to understand the hatching process. They recorded both the developmental stage of eggs at 31 nests and the deaths of octopus mothers.</p>
<p>"After the <strong>hatchlings</strong> come out of the nest and swim off immediately into the dark, the mothers, who never left their nest and never appeared to feed during nesting, soon die," said James Barry. Barry is a biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and co-writer of the study.</p>
<p>The researchers found that eggs at this site hatch after about 21 months. The same process takes four years or more for other deep-sea octopuses.</p>
<p>"Usually, colder water slows down metabolism and embryonic development and extends life span in the deep sea. But here in this spot, warmth appears to speed things up," said Adi Khen. Khen is a biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>Mike Vecchione is a zoologist and octopus expert with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. He praised the researchers for gathering "so much detailed data about such a <strong>remote</strong> location."</p>
<p>Such octopus gardens "may be widespread and really important in the deep sea," he said. "There's still so much to discover in the deep sea."</p>

            <title>Japanese Company Develops Digital ‘Clones’ of Individuals  (2023/8/29)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>A Japanese company is developing digital "<strong>clones</strong>" of individuals designed to take over some of a person's daily online duties.</p>
<p>The company is Tokyo-based Alt Incorporated. It is working on creating a digital double – an <strong>animated</strong> image that looks and talks just like its human owner.</p>
<p>The company's chief executive, Kazutaka Yonekura, told The Associated Press he believes such a double could make people's lives easier by helping them get more things done.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kazutaka Yonekura, head of Tokyo startup Alt Inc., demonstrates his digital clone on a personal computer in Tokyo, Aug. 17, 2023. (AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-996c-08dba7c483bc_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Kazutaka Yonekura, head of Tokyo startup Alt Inc., demonstrates his digital clone on a personal computer in Tokyo, Aug. 17, 2023. (AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)</span></div>
<p>The digital clone, also called an avatar, could be used for things like carrying out early job interviews or communicating with a person's doctor ahead of a medical visit.</p>
<p>Yonekura said the main purpose of a digital double would be to "<strong>liberate</strong>" humans from the many daily duties. He showed AP reporters his own digital clone on a computer. It included an image and digitized version of his voice.</p>
<p>When his digital clone was asked, "What kind of music do you like," it waited several seconds before giving a long answer. The double explained that Yonekura favors lively music such as hip-hop or rock 'n' roll.</p>
<p>Yonekura argues that the technology he is developing is more personal than other digital assistants, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant. He said most importantly, the clone belongs to you and not the technology company that created it. Yonekura added that his developers had attempted to build tools into the system that are designed to prevent <strong>awkward</strong> social mistakes.</p>
<p>Currently, digital doubles are very costly. Each Alt clone costs about $140,000, so it will likely take time before there is a mass market for the clones.</p>
<p>Digital doubles are created by taking an individual's data from social media websites as well as publicly available records. The data is continuously changed and stored in the system. The data is designed to keep up with the individual's changing <strong>habits</strong> and activities.</p>
<p>Yonekura said he believes a digital clone could open the door for a society in which people can center on being more creative and waste less time on necessary daily activities.</p>
<p>The idea of a digital clone reportedly enjoys widespread appeal in Japan – the country that gave the world Pokemon, karaoke, Hello Kitty and emojis.</p>
<p>But Yonekura admits that cultures are different, and Westerners may not like the idea as much. "I can't tell you how many times I've been asked: Why does it have to be a personal clone, and not just a digital agent?" he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>In 2017, a workplace accident resulted in Phil Durst losing sight in his left eye.<br/>
2017年，一场工作事故导致菲尔·德斯特左眼失明。</p>
<p>He experienced severe pain from the incident which left him unable to tolerate light. He also experienced severe headaches four or five times a day.<br/>
这次事故让他感到剧烈疼痛，并导致他无法忍受光线。他每天还会出现四五次剧烈头痛。</p>
<p>Then he underwent an experimental operation that aims to treat severe injuries in one eye with stem cells from the other eye.<br/>
然后他接受了一项实验性手术，旨在用另一只眼睛的干细胞治疗另一只眼睛的严重损伤。</p>
<p>Durst said he went from being completely blind to seeing well enough to drive. Regaining his sight was an emotional experience for the 51-year-old from Homewood, Alabama.<br/>
杜斯特说，他从完全失明到视力足够驾驶汽车。对于这位来自阿拉巴马州霍姆伍德的51岁的老人来说，重见光明是一次激动人心的经历。</p>
<p>Durst was one of four patients to get stem cell transplants as part of the first study to test the method in the United States. Although additional treatment is needed, experts say the stem cell transplant offers hope to people who are not getting results from other methods.<br/>
作为美国首次疗法测试研究的一部分，杜斯特是四名接受干细胞移植患者中的一员。虽然需要额外的治疗，但专家表示，干细胞移植为那些别无他法的人们带来了希望。</p>
<p>The experimental research results were published recently in Science Advances. A larger study is underway.<br/>
这项实验性研究结果最近发表在《科学进展》上。同时一项更大规模的研究正在进行中。</p>
<p>The operation is designed to treat "limbal stem cell deficiency." It is a disorder of part of the eye called the cornea. The problem happens after chemical burns and other injuries. Limbal cells are needed to keep the outer surface of the cornea healthy. Patients without limbal cells cannot have corneal transplants that are commonly used to improve sight.<br/>
这项手术旨在治疗“角膜缘干细胞缺乏症”，这是眼睛角膜部分的一种疾病。这种问题发生在化学烧伤和其他伤害之后。角膜外层的健康需要角膜细胞。没有角膜缘细胞的患者不能进行角膜移植，这是常用来改善视力的手段。</p>
<p>Dr. Ula Jurkunas is an ophthalmologist at the treatment center Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, Massachusetts. She was the main researcher for the study. She said the experimental method involves taking a few stem cells from the healthy eye, then expanding them and growing them on a graft. The research took place at a laboratory at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.<br/>
 乌拉·尤尔库纳斯医生是马萨诸塞州波士顿市大众眼耳治疗中心的眼科医生。她是这项研究的主要研究员。她说，这种实验性方法包括从健康的眼睛中提取一些干细胞，然后将其扩增并在移植物上生长。这项研究是在波士顿癌症研究所的一个实验室进行的。</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the grafts are transplanted into the injured eye. Durst was the first patient to undergo the operation.<br/>
几周后，移植物被移植到受伤的眼睛里。德斯特是第一个接受手术的病人。</p>
<p>"The great part of it is that we're using a patient's own tissue," not donor tissue the body might reject, Jurkunas said.<br/>
尤尔库纳斯说：“最重要的是，我们使用的是患者自己的组织，”而不是身体可能会排斥的供体组织。</p>
<p>She said this method is better than a different operation that takes a very large piece of stem cells from a healthy eye for use on an injured eye – but risks damaging the good eye.<br/>
她说，这种方法比从健康的眼睛中取出一大块干细胞用于受伤的眼睛的另一种疗法要好，但是存在损伤健康眼睛的风险。</p>
<p>Both of Durst's eyes were hurt in the accident. For six to eight months, his sight was so bad that his wife or son had to lead him around. But his right eye was less injured than his left one and could provide stem cells for the transplant.<br/>
德斯特的两只眼睛都在事故中受伤。在六到八个月的时间里，他的视力非常差，以至于他的妻儿不得不领着他四处走动。但他的右眼比左眼受伤轻，可以为移植提供干细胞。</p>
<p>Jurkunas also works with Harvard Medical School. She said Durst's 2018 operation was the product of almost 20 years of research. She said the researchers were happy to finally do the operation.<br/>
尤尔库纳斯还跟哈佛医学院合作。她说，德斯特2018年做的手术是近20年研究的成果。她说，研究人员很高兴终于做了这项手术。</p>
<p>All patients in the study reported that their cornea surfaces improved to normal. Durst and another patient were then able to get transplants of man-made corneas. Two others reported improved sight with the stem cell transplant alone. A fifth patient did not receive the operation because the stem cells were not able to expand enough.<br/>
研究中的所有患者都报告称，他们的角膜表面已恢复正常。随后，德斯特和另一名患者得以进行人造角膜移植。另外两人报告称，光做了干细胞移植就提高了视力。第五名患者没有接受手术，因为干细胞不能充分扩增。</p>
<p>Durst said the vision in his right eye is nearly normal but the vision in his left could improve. He will have another operation in September to correct it.<br/>
德斯特说，他的右眼视力几乎正常，但左眼的视力有待改善。他将在9月份进行另一次手术来纠正这种情况。</p>
<p>Researchers are finishing the next step of the clinical trial, which includes 15 patients.<br/>
研究人员正在完成下一步的临床试验，该试验包括15名患者。</p>
<p>Jurkunas estimates that 1,000 people in the U.S. could be helped every year by this sort of stem cell transplant. The treatment has also been studied in Japan.<br/>
尤尔库纳斯估计，美国每年有1000人可以通过这种干细胞移植得到帮助。日本也对这种治疗方法进行了研究。</p>

<p>Forty-two years ago, hospital workers took Maria Angelica Gonzalez' son from her arms right after birth. Documents say they later told her he had died. Now, she was meeting him face-to-face at her home in Valdivia, Chile.</p>
<p>"I love you very much," Jimmy Lippert Thyden told his mother in Spanish as they hugged and cried.</p>
<p>"It <strong>knocked the wind out of</strong> me," Thyden told <em>The Associated Press</em> after the meeting.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Jimmy Thyden, right, sits with Maria Angelica Gonzalez, his Chilean birth mother, as they meet for the first time in Valdivia, Chile on Aug. 17, 2023.(Constanza Del Rio/Nos Buscamos via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-6ef8-08dba7d80b44_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Jimmy Thyden, right, sits with Maria Angelica Gonzalez, his Chilean birth mother, as they meet for the first time in Valdivia, Chile on Aug. 17, 2023.(Constanza Del Rio/Nos Buscamos via AP)</span></div>
<p>His effort to find the birth family he never knew began in April. That was when he read news stories about <strong>adoptees</strong> who had been born in Chile and had been reunited with their birth relatives through a Chilean nonprofit group called Nos Buscamos.</p>
<p>The organization found that Thyden had been born <strong>prematurely</strong> at a hospital in Santiago, Chile's capital, and had been placed in an <strong>incubator</strong>. Gonzalez was told to leave the hospital, but when she returned to get her baby, she was told he had died and his body had been removed, documents say.</p>
<p>"The paperwork I have for my adoption tells me I have no living relatives. And I learned in the last few months that I have a mama and I have four brothers and a sister," Thyden said. He now lives in Ashburn, Virginia, where he works as a criminal defense lawyer.</p>
<p>He said his was a case of "<strong>counterfeit</strong> adoption."</p>
<p>The group Nos Buscamos estimates that tens of thousands of babies were taken from Chilean families in the 1970s and 1980s. That claim is based on a report from the Investigations Police of Chile, a civilian group, which examined the passports of Chilean children who left the country and never returned.</p>
<p>"The real story was these kids were stolen from poor families, poor women, that didn't know how to defend themselves," said Constanza del Rio, founder and director and Nos Buscamos.</p>
<p>The group said the disappearances took place during the rule of General Augusto Pinochet, who led the country for 17 years starting in 1973. Pinochet led a group which overthrew Marxist President Salvador Allende. Chile's government says at least 3,095 people were killed during that time.</p>
<p>Over the past nine years, Nos Buscamos has organized reunions for more than 450 adoptees and their birth families, del Rio said. Other nonprofit groups are doing similar work, both in Chile and the U.S.</p>
<p>Nos Buscamos has been partnering for two years with the <strong>genealogy</strong> company MyHeritage. MyHeritage gives DNA testing kits for use at home at no cost to Chilean adoptees and suspected victims of child trafficking in Chile.</p>
<p>Thyden's DNA test result said that he was 100 percent Chilean. It said he was related to another person who also uses MyHeritage. The website said the person was a first cousin.</p>
<p>Thyden sent the cousin his adoption documents, which included an address for his birth mother and a very common name in Chile: Maria Angelica Gonzalez. His cousin had a Maria Angelica Gonzalez on their mother's side and helped him make the connection.</p>
<p>Thyden said his reunion with his birth family was a success. But, he knows that reunification might not go as well for other adoptees.</p>
<p>"It could have been a much worse story," he said. "There are people who find out some really unfortunate details about their <strong>origin</strong>."</p>
<p>While in Chile, Thyden and del Rio met with one of seven investigators working on thousands of counterfeit adoption cases like his own. Thyden also met with Juan Gabriel Valdes, the Chilean ambassador to the United States, to seek government recognition of the adoption <strong>scheme</strong>.</p>
<p>He said there was no way to assist Chilean adoptees in their efforts to visit their home country. Thyden said he sold a truck to pay for his family's airplane tickets and other costs.</p>
<p>He said, "People need to be able to decide...what their name is going to be, where their citizenship is going to be...They should have all the rights and <strong>privileges</strong> of a Chilean citizen because this is a thing that happened to them, not that they chose."</p>

<p>Scientists say they have discovered new evidence that cloud activity on Neptune is linked to atmospheric changes on the planet caused by the sun.</p>
<p>Researchers say the evidence is based on observations collected by several telescopes over a period of nearly 30 years. Data was collected by the Hubble Space Telescope – operated by the American space agency NASA – as well as the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Lick Observatory in California.</p>
<p>Astronomers recorded atmospheric changes on Neptune as they examined the cloud data. The researchers found that the changes followed the sun's natural cycle. Each natural <strong>cycle</strong>, known as the solar cycle, lasts about 11 years.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Image of Neptune, from Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam).

<p>During this cycle, the sun's magnetic field completely <strong>flips</strong>. This means the sun's north and south magnetic poles change places. They then flip back after another 11 years. Before the flip, a major increase in solar activity happens. This can send powerful collections of solar particles shooting through space.</p>
<p>The scientists who examined the telescope data said they found that Neptune appeared brightest in 2002, then <strong>dimmed</strong> in 2007. The planet became bright again in 2015, but then darkened in 2020 to the dimmest level ever observed.</p>
<p>The team said the observations also showed Neptune lost nearly all of its clouds beginning in 2019.</p>
<p>Astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) led the research. They recently reported their findings <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103523002440?via%3Dihub">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Icarus</em>.</p>
<p>Imke de Pater is a retired professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley and was the lead writer of the study. She <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/neptune-clouds/">said</a> in a statement she was surprised by how quickly clouds disappeared on Neptune. She noted cloud activity had dropped sharply "within a few months."</p>
<p>"Even four years later, the images we took this past June showed the clouds haven't returned to their former levels," said Erandi Chavez. She is a student at Harvard University's Center for Astrophysics who took part in the study while at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>"This is extremely exciting and unexpected," Chavez said. She noted the finding was unusual "since Neptune's previous period of low cloud activity was not nearly as <strong>dramatic</strong> and <strong>prolonged</strong>."</p>
<p>Neptune, about four times wider than Earth, is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our sun, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/overview/">says</a>. It receives sunlight with only about 0.1 percent intensity of our planet. For this reason, the researchers found it surprising that Neptune would be heavily influenced by solar activity. The planet also receives intense winds that can blow around clouds.</p>
<p>The scientists looked at images captured by the different telescopes. They discovered clear <strong>patterns</strong> between seasonal changes in Neptune's cloud cover and the solar cycle. The team found that during periods when the sun gave off more intense ultraviolet (UV) light, more clouds appeared on the planet two years later.</p>
<p>De Pater said the newly discovered data provides "the strongest evidence yet that Neptune's cloud cover <strong>correlates</strong> with the sun's cycle." He added the findings "support the theory that the sun's UV rays, when strong enough, may be <strong>triggering</strong> a photochemical reaction that produces Neptune's clouds." Photochemical is a term relating to how chemicals are affected by light.</p>
<p>The researchers are continuing to follow cloud activity on Neptune. They noted that the latest images taken of the planet, in June 2023, showed clouds started to return. The team says this finding further strengthens their evidence. This is because the scientists see a link between the increasing cloud cover and the release of intense UV light over the past two years.</p>
<p>The researchers say further study is needed to confirm their latest results. They say the research will be important not only for learning more about Neptune, but can also help scientists gain a better understanding of how similar planets outside our solar system behave.</p>

<p>American food and drug officials recently approved the first RSV vaccine for pregnant women. The drug will <strong>inoculate</strong> the fetus and provide protection from the dangerous lung disease at birth.</p>
<p>RSV stands for respiratory syncytial virus. RSV cases fill hospitals with<strong> wheezing</strong> babies every fall and winter. Pfizer's newly approved vaccine will mean babies can be protected against RSV at birth. Experts say this will guard against severe RSV infections when babies are most <strong>vulnerable</strong> — from birth through 6 months.</p>
<p>The drug is named Abrysvo. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must issue guidelines, or recommendations, for use of Abrysvo during pregnancy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Pfizer shows the RSV vaccine.

(Pfizer via AP)</span></div>
<p>"Maternal vaccination is an <strong>incredible</strong> way to protect the infants," said Dr. Elizabeth Schlaudecker of Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Ohio. Schlaudecker was among the researchers in Pfizer's international study of the vaccine. If shots begin soon, she said, "I do think we could see an <strong>impact </strong>for this RSV season."</p>
<p>RSV is a minor sickness for most healthy people but it can be life-threatening for the very young. It swells babies' airways, making breathing difficult. It can also lead to the disease pneumonia. In the U.S. alone, the disease leads to hospital stays for between 58,000 and 80,000 children under the age of 5 each year. It kills several hundred a year.</p>
<p>Last year's RSV season was bad in the U.S. It began sickening young children in the summer, far earlier than usual.</p>
<p>Babies are born with an under-developed defense<strong> </strong>system. They depend on their mothers for disease protection in the first few months after birth.</p>
<p>Here is how the RSV vaccination treatment will work: A single injection late in pregnancy gives enough time for the mother to develop antibodies. These pass to the fetus and are ready to work at birth.</p>
<p>It is the same way pregnant women pass along protection against other infections. Pregnant women have long been urged to get flu and whooping cough vaccines, and more recently, COVID-19 shots.</p>
<p>Pfizer's study included nearly 7,400 pregnant women and their babies. Maternal vaccination did not prevent mild RSV infection. However, it proved 82 percent effective at preventing a severe case during the first three months after birth. At age 6 months, it still was proving 69 percent effective against severe sickness.</p>
<p>Vaccine reactions were mostly tiredness and pain at the site of injection. In the study, there was a small difference in early birth — just a few weeks early — between vaccinated moms and those given an inactive shot. Pfizer has said that outcome was due to chance. The FDA said to avoid the possibility of early birth, the vaccination should take place between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy. The researchers vaccinated the study patients a few weeks earlier in the process.</p>
<p>If enough pregnant women get vaccinated, Pfizer predicts the U.S. could prevent as many as 20,000 infant hospitalizations a year and 320,000 doctor visits.</p>
<p>The only other way to guard babies from RSV is to give them lab-made antibodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also recently approved a new drug for all infants younger than 8 months. Called Beyfortus, it is a single <strong>dose</strong> treatment given before a baby's first RSV season. Sanofi and AstraZeneca made the drug, which is supposed to be available this fall.</p>
<p>Schlaudecker, the Cincinnati Children's Hospital doctor, predicts that doctors will try a combination of the treatments when they become available.</p>
<p>Another Cincinnati Children's Hospital doctor volunteered to take part in Pfizer's vaccine study when she became pregnant. Dr. Maria Deza Leon has cared for seriously sick RSV patients in her work.</p>
<p>"The last thing a parent wants to see is their kid struggling to breathe," she said. "I was also at risk of being the person that could get RSV and give it to my son without even realizing."</p>
<p>Deza Leon received her shot in late January 2022 and her son Joaquin was born the following month. The doctor has not yet learned if she received the vaccine or the inactive shot. However, Joaquin is a healthy little boy who has never had a confirmed case of RSV.</p>

<p>On most Sundays, the sound of hammers and other tools hitting stone can be heard in the burial area of ancient Xochiaca. It is a village in the Chimalhuacan area, on Mexico City's east side.</p>
<p>The sounds come from stone <strong>carvers</strong> who still work on a <strong>craft</strong> that has been passed down for generations - even after the local source of stone was used up.</p>
<p>The village burial area, or cemetery, is filled with meter-high statues of religious figures and other beautiful stone objects.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Master stone carver Tom&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;225;s Ugarte sculpts quarry at the cemetery in the Mexico City borough of Chilmalhuacan, once the ancient village of Xochiaca, Sunday, July 2, 2023.

</span></div>
<p>Generations of stone carvers in Chimalhuacan also created much of the stonework found on buildings and parks in the capital's downtown.</p>
<p>While carvers in other areas long ago turned to mechanical devices, the workers here use only hammers and other special hand tools.</p>
<p>Many are self-taught, but some, like Tomás Ugarte, age 86, learned in the traditional way. This method of rock cutting has been passed down between family members, dating back about five generations.</p>
<p>The rock cutters are generally older. There were about 600 official stone carvers about 10 years ago. Now, there are probably only around 300, said Carolina Montesinos Mendoza of the state office that supports traditional skills. The carvers are dying and their children generally do not want to take up the trade.</p>
<p>Still, the stone carvers keep the old traditions alive. Many people in the area use stone <strong>mortars</strong> and <strong>pestles</strong> made by the stone carvers. Known as "molcajetes" in Spanish, these bowl-like objects are the basic tool for making salsas.</p>
<p>Rev. Alberto Sandoval, who has known the stone workers since 1990, described them as "the backbone of the community."</p>
<p>Most of the carvers have individual work areas at home, which provide them with some money. They sell carvings for prices ranging from $500 to $2,000. But the stone carvers often do not sell much.</p>
<p>Unlike many craftspeople who want to see their works shown in<strong> museums</strong>, the carvers here work free of charge to create and maintain carvings for the local cemetery.</p>
<p>They also work for free at <strong>decorating</strong> and repairing the stonework at the 250-year-old local church, Santa María de Guadalupe.</p>
<p>One of the earliest signs of the stone carvers' work is a carved stone on the ground reading "Xochiaca, home of the stone carvers." It does not have a date.</p>
<p>The writing talks about a time when the lake that once covered much of the valley still touched Xochiaca. Builders would come looking for carvings and ship them to Mexico City on ships over the lake.</p>
<p>Juan Alfaro Bastidas, 75, is a carver, just as his father and grandfather were. He remembers going into the rock mines, or quarries, by candlelight to get blocks of stone.</p>
<p>But the quarries are just a memory now.</p>
<p>The land where the quarries stood was sold for housing developments.</p>
<p>Now, the carvers truck in stone from other states to the north and to the west, but sometimes from as far away as the southern state of Yucatan.</p>
<p>They get some help from the local government and local people.</p>
<p>"The neighbors have helped us out with donations of 100 or 200 pesos ($6 to $12). The people of the town buy the stone," said Bastidas.</p>
<p>Asked if the trade will survive, carver Mario Olivares read a poem written on the church wall: "Your art, your tradition, your culture and the <strong>nobility</strong> of the people keep the soul of this town alive."</p>

<p>India's decision to halt some rice exports to prevent high prices at home has had affects stretching across Asia to Africa, observers say.</p>
<p>Rice prices in Kenya, for example, jumped when Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is a big producer of fertilizer. That problem combined with years of little rain in the Horn of Africa hurt East Africa's rice production. Low-cost rice from India helped fill Africa's needs, feeding hundreds of thousands of people who live in poor areas of Nairobi on less than $2 a day.</p>
<p>But the price of a 25-kilogram container of rice in Kenya has risen by more than 12 percent, or more than $14 since June. Importers there say they have not received shipments from India.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE- Laborers stack rice in a private warehouse in Makhu, in the Indian state of Punjab, March 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9d94-08dba4149411_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE- Laborers stack rice in a private warehouse in Makhu, in the Indian state of Punjab, March 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File)</span></div>
<p>Fifty-one-year-old Francis Ndege has been selling rice to the poor in Nairobi for 30 years. He said, "I'm really hoping the imports keep coming."</p>
<p>Cutting food exports is part of India's effort to keep prices at home low to prevent widespread public anger at the government. The restrictions, however, take 9.5 million metric tons off the worldwide market. That is about a fifth of rice exports worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>An inflection point</strong></p>
<p>In addition to India's moves, the Associated Press reports that Vietnam's rice export prices have reached a 15 year high. And Russia, which had earlier agreed to permitted agricultural exports from Ukraine, withdrew a United Nations-supported deal last month.</p>
<p>Beau Damen works with natural resources in Bangkok for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. He said the world is at an "<strong>inflection point</strong>."</p>
<p>Even before India restricted rice exports, countries were buying rice with the expectation that supplies would soon be limited.</p>
<p>Some observers worry that other nations will follow India. The AP reports that the United Arab Emirates has suspended rice exports to preserve supplies although it is not a supplier. Other observers worry that bad weather will affect rice harvests. They are saying the El Ni<i></i>241;o ocean event could affect harvests in many countries.</p>
<p>El Ni<i></i>241;o is a warm southern Pacific Ocean current that affects weather across a large area of the world. It takes place regularly but is difficult to predict.</p>
<p><strong>Rice demand in Africa growing</strong></p>
<p>In Africa, rice <strong>consumption</strong> has been growing regularly. Most countries depend heavily on imports. Some African nations with growing populations are trying to grow their own rice. But the results have not been what some had hoped.</p>
<p>Amadou Khan is a 52-year-old unemployed father of five children in Dakar. He said his children eat rice with every meal except breakfast. He said his family is "just getting by."</p>
<p>Seventy percent of Senegal's imported rice comes from India, but it is now too costly. So, Khan is buying rice grown at home which is two-thirds the price.</p>
<p>Senegal's agriculture ministry said more than half of the country's demand is grown locally. The ministry said Senegal is not "far from being <strong>self-sufficient</strong>."</p>
<p>Asian countries grow and use 90 percent of the world's rice. But even in Asia, some countries are struggling. The Philippines, for example, had an estimated 22 percent of its yearly production damaged by Typhoon Doksuri. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the Philippines is the second largest rice importer after China.</p>
<p><strong>‘No one wants to take the risk'</strong></p>
<p>India's export restrictions and production problems blamed on the weather there make it an undependable export partner. That is what Ashok Gulati of the Indian Council for Research and International Economic relations said. He added, "That's not good for the export business because it takes years to develop these markets."</p>
<p>Vietnam hopes to make gains during the current market movements. With prices high, it hopes to increase production. The Agriculture Ministry also wants to use more land in the Mekong Delta to grow rice. The Philippines is negotiating with Vietnam to get favorable prices. Vietnam also wants to target Britain, which gets rice from India.</p>
<p>Thailand is another big rice producer. The government expects to export more rice this year than last. Exports in the first six months of 2023 were 15 percent higher than the same period last year.</p>
<p>But the situation in India has farmers and traders worried. Charoen Laothamatas is president of the Thai Rice Exporters Association. He said farmers are raising prices for <strong>unmilled </strong>rice and mill operators, who process the rice, are unwilling to sell it. The millers want to get the best price under current market conditions.</p>
<p>Lack of clarity about supplies leaves exporters unsure about prices and leads to an unwillingness to sell.</p>
<p>As a result, Laothamatas noted, "No one wants to take the risk."</p>

<p>Kara Baker recently graduated from high school in the state of Indiana. She earned more than a high school <strong>diploma</strong>, however. She also completed a two-year <strong>associate degree</strong> at the local community college, Ivy Tech.</p>
<p>This summer, Baker is taking more classes at Ivy Tech before beginning her studies at Purdue University, also in Indiana. She hopes to become a <strong>veterinarian</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE --Terre Haute Campus, Ivy Tech Community College (Courtesy photo, Ivy Tech Community College)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a1b3-08db92a3706c_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE --Terre Haute Campus, Ivy Tech Community College (Courtesy photo, Ivy Tech Community College)</span></div>
<p>In many areas in the U.S., students can earn college credit at community colleges while they are still in high school. Many of these programs are called dual-credit programs.</p>
<p>And in recent years, some community colleges have begun offering <strong>courses</strong> to high schoolers at no cost during the summer.</p>
<p>Programs like these aim to get more students to enter community college and to help them finish programs they have already started.</p>
<p>The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center provides reporting on issues in education. It said <strong>enrollment</strong> at community colleges has decreased by nearly 40 percent over the past 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Free summer programs for high school students</strong></p>
<p>Baker said she was looking for programs to help her recover time lost in her education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ivy Tech was the answer.</p>
<p>"I felt very behind <strong>due to</strong> Covid," Baker says. "[High] school slowed down, but my online college classes continued on. I was so grateful."</p>
<p>With 43 <strong>campuses</strong> across the state of Indiana, Ivy Tech has the most students of any community college system in the U.S.</p>
<p>During the 2019-2020 school year, there were over 63,000 Indiana high school students in Ivy Tech's dual-credit program. But the COVID-19 pandemic made it more difficult for some students to finish the program.</p>
<p>As a result, Ivy Tech began its "Crossing the Finish Line" program in summer of 2021. The program lets high school students who are close to finishing their studies at Ivy Tech take their remaining classes at no cost during the summer.</p>
<p>The program saw completion of 714 programs of study in summer of 2021, and an additional 900 during the 2021-22 school year. Students paid for any courses they had to finish during the fall or spring.</p>
<p>The results of the Crossing the Finish Line program were good. So, in 2022, Ivy Tech began offering free college credit courses in summer to high school students, even if they were not in a dual-credit program. Any student from grades nine through 12 who meets the requirements may take the summer classes.</p>
<p>In the U.S., students from grades 9-12 are usually between 14 and 18 years old.</p>
<p>Including both the Crossing the Finish Line and other free summer courses, this year nearly 8,000 Indiana high schoolers are taking free college classes at Ivy Tech.</p>
<p><strong>Saving money and time</strong></p>
<p>Officials at Ivy Tech said the free classes have saved students and their families about 6.5 million dollars this summer. A three-credit class at Ivy Tech usually costs students about $510.</p>
<p>The Indiana Department of Education pays for the Crossing the Finish Line program, while Ivy Tech is spending about 3.6 million dollars to pay for other summer classes.</p>
<p>Baker told VOA Learning English that the college classes might save her up to two years of college credit as she works towards becoming a veterinarian. For her, the college credit she received means less money spent on student loans.</p>
<p>"As I look at future student loans, I am grateful for the opportunities Ivy Tech presented," she said.</p>
<p>Seeing students finish their programs and continue in higher education makes the cost worth it, said Monica Marianna Hingst. She is Interim Vice President for K-14 and Strategic Initiatives at Ivy Tech.</p>
<p>"Getting students to come here and take courses for free is great. It's even better when it's aligned toward a completion, because once you earn that certification, or once you earn that degree, you are now setting yourself up for success."</p>
<p><strong>Northern Virginia Community College</strong></p>
<p>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) is one of the largest community college systems in the U.S. Its JumpStart2NOVA program permits students who finish high school in the spring to take college courses for free during the summer. NOVA started the program in 2020 to help students continue their education during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In addition to classes, students receive free online help with their studies. They can also attend free weekly information sessions on how to succeed in their education.</p>
<p>There are about 700 students in the program this year. JumpStart2NOVA helps both the students, the community college, and the local community, said Dr. Eun-Woo Chang, Chief Academic Officer at NOVA.</p>
<p>He noted that having more students finish their programs of study helps provide skilled workers for the local economy.</p>
<p>"It's a good investment to make them to stay at NOVA and also Northern Virginia, so this helps the regional economy here."</p>
<p>He added, "Community colleges are in the community that needs a lot more resources...they are underserved. We are here for them."</p>
<p>Chemeketa Community College is in the state of Oregon. Its BOLT program offers 12 different five-week college credit courses for free for up to 450 students in the summer. The students must be entering or finishing their last year of high school. Like the program at Ivy Tech in Indiana, the BOLT program also pays for the cost of textbooks.</p>
<p>Chemeketa designed the BOLT program because Covid-19 affected the schools in the area. The program supports students who have fewer chances to take college courses for credit.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for college</strong></p>
<p>Back in Indiana, Kara Baker adds that Ivy Tech has helped her with more than time and money.</p>
<p>"Ivy Tech took my learning and thinking to that next level. I feel I am better prepared to manage the college experience," she said.</p>
<p>Baker added, "I felt I was driven more as a student, as I saw a more diverse future outlook compared to my fellow high school students."</p>

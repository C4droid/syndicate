        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>South Korean Scientists Develop ‘Beef Rice’  (2024/3/24)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>South Korean researchers have combined cow muscle cells with rice grains. They say the new rice is an important step towards a <strong>sustainable</strong>, less costly source of protein. The researchers suggested it could replace the meat of farmed cattle, or beef.</p>
<p>Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University led the research. Hong said the "beef rice" is the first product of its kind. The results of the research were recently published in <em>Matter.</em></p>
<p>The beef rice uses grain particles as the base for growing animal muscle and fat cells.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Hybrid beef rice, elaborated using cow muscle and fat stem cells, is set on a table at the Reuters studio in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c5b8b96f-38d6-4fe5-b920-668a9317c04f_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Hybrid beef rice, elaborated using cow muscle and fat stem cells, is set on a table at the Reuters studio in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon)</span></div>
<p>The researchers treated rice grains with chemicals called enzymes to create an environment for cell growth. They added cells from cattle to create the final product, which is a combination, or hybrid, of the two. The result looks like a grain of rice with a <strong>pink</strong> color.</p>
<p>Companies around the world have launched efforts to develop meat that is grown in a laboratory. One of the latest attempts involves plant-based chicken and eel meat developed from soybean that is sold in Singapore.</p>
<p>Hong's team said rice has an added gain in terms of safety compared to soy or nuts because fewer people have <strong>allergic </strong>reactions to it.</p>
<p>He said that if it is developed into food products, "cultured beef rice could serve as a sustainable protein source." He added that it would be good in environments where traditional animal farming is too difficult.</p>
<p>The beef rice contains around eight percent more protein and seven percent more fat than normal rice. Hong noted the protein is 18 percent animal based. That makes it a good source of important nutrients needed by humans called essential amino acids.</p>
<p>Beef rice costs about two dollars per kilogram. Hong said it results in the release of less carbon gas than traditional cattle raising. He said that it could compete with other products in stores.</p>
<p>Hong said there are still some problems in production. And, he added, it will not be easy to get people to accept its taste and how it feels in the mouth, or its texture.</p>
<p>Keum Dong-kyu recently ate the beef rice at a restaurant in the Korean capital Seoul. He praised the new idea.</p>
<p>Keum said, "But honestly, I don't think it can <strong>replicate</strong> the <strong>juiciness</strong> or texture of real beef."</p>
<p>Christian Krammel, who is from Germany, expressed hope for the future.</p>
<p>Krammel said, "Now, it does not compare to beef yet, but as I see the research is in early stages, I would say it's a great way forward."</p>

            <title>When Is Something 'Ancient History'?  (2024/3/24)</title>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Do you like to learn about <u>ancient history</u>? If you do, you could call yourself a history <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/a-23-2007-03-19-voa1-83133537/127470.html">buff</a>. If you are a "buff," you have a strong interest in a subject and want to learn all about it.</p>
<p>History buffs can have a special interest in a particular historical period in the past. For example, they might read a lot about ancient Greek or Roman history. History buffs might be interested in ancient Mesopotamia or Carthage. Or perhaps the ancient Mayans or Incas would be <u>up their alley</u>. If something is <u>up your alley</u>, it goes along with your interests. It is something you want to know more about.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People gather at Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, June 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-6bc1-08db726e0f1e_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - People gather at Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, June 21, 2023.

<p>However, English speakers use the expression <u>ancient history</u> in other ways. And many have nothing to do with exploring cultures from long ago.</p>
<p>For example, if something is <u>ancient history</u>, it is no longer meaningful or <strong>relevant</strong>. It is outdated or totally forgotten. Something that is <u>ancient history</u> is old news.</p>
<p>Let's say a business owner wants to modernize and update her workspace. She says she wants to get a new fax machine. But then, her young son tells her fax machines are <u>ancient history</u>.</p>
<p><u>Ancient history</u> can describe events in a person's past. Let's say a co-worker always talks about his time in high school. When he asks about yours, you might say that your high school days are <u>ancient history</u>. You barely remember them.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use <u>ancient history</u> to mean something has been completely forgotten – even if it is a fairly recent event. It just feels like it happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>For example, two friends of yours want to start a business together. Last month, it was a café. Now, their latest idea is offering storage units for <strong>rent</strong>. When you ask about the café idea, they might say, "Oh, that idea is <u>ancient history</u>. We've moved on from that."</p>
<p>We also use <u>ancient history</u> in another way. Sometimes <u>ancient history</u> means an issue has been resolved and is no longer a problem. It is <u>water under the bridge</u>. <u>Water under the bridge</u> is another idiom that means a problem no longer exists.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you had an unpleasant experience with a good friend, but it happened years ago. You both value your friendship and choose <u>to forgive and forget</u>. The problem is no longer an issue between the two of you. It is <u>ancient history</u>.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Historic Bridges Are Under Threat from Modern GPS  (2024/3/24) | 美国古廊桥受到汽车导航系统威胁</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Historic covered bridges in the United States are under threat by the use of the modern technology GPS.<br/>
美国历史悠久的廊桥正受到GPS这种现代技术的威胁。</p>
<p>GPS is short for Global Positioning System. The satellite system tells people who use map applications what roads to use to go from one place to another.<br/>
GPS是全球定位系统的缩写。这种卫星系统会告诉地图应用程序的用户从一地到另一地走什么路。</p>
<p>The historic bridges usually have signs, including flashing lights, to warn trucks that are too tall or too heavy not to cross. But some truck drivers do not follow the warnings and crash into the bridge. They say the GPS directed them onto the bridge. Many times, the drivers are using systems made for cars instead of large trucks.<br/>
历史悠久的桥梁通常都有标志，包括闪光灯，以警告那些太高或太重而无法通过的卡车。但一些卡车司机没有听从警告，然后撞上了桥。他们说GPS指引他们上了桥。很多时候，这些司机都是使用为小汽车而不是为大卡车制作的系统。</p>
<p>In the northeastern state of Vermont, Lyndon town officials say the 146-year-old Miller's Bridge has been hit more than 20 times.<br/>
在东北部佛蒙特州，林登镇官员说，有146年历史的米勒大桥已经被撞了20多次。</p>
<p>Justin Smith is an administrator for Lyndon. "GPS is the most general excuse that is given by drivers that do hit the bridge," he said. Drivers can face a fine of $5,000 from the town, plus payments to the state. But he added that the real problem is drivers simply not thinking about their actions.<br/>
贾斯汀·史密斯是林登镇的行政长官。他说：“GPS是那些撞上大桥的司机给出的最普遍的借口。”司机可能面临该镇5000美元的罚款，以及州政府的罚款。但他补充说，真正的问题是司机根本不考虑自己的行为。</p>
<p>Jack Harris is the head of Lyndon's police. He said that the bridge had to be closed twice for major repairs. Each time, it took several months to finish the job.<br/>
杰克·哈里斯是林登<span style="font-size: 9pt;">镇</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">的警察局长。他说，为了进行大修，这座桥不得不关闭两次。每次都要花几个月的时间才能完成这项工作。</span></p>
<p>In 2019, a truck hit the bridge supports. Engineering and repair costs were nearly $100,000, said Smith.<br/>
2019年，一辆卡车撞上了桥梁支座。史密斯说，工程和维修费用将近10万美元。</p>
<p>About half the time, the town gets its money back through the drivers' insurance — if it catches them. Many drivers simply drive away without telling officials about the accident. A nearby security camera aimed at the bridge has helped officials find some drivers.<br/>
大约有一半的时间，小镇能通过司机的保险拿回钱 — 如果抓到了他们的话。许多司机在没有告诉官员发生事故的情况下就直接开车离开了。附近的安防摄像头对准了大桥，帮助官员找到了一些司机。</p>
<p>"They will claim that they didn't know they hit it and yet you'll see the truck stop in the middle of the bridge and they'll look up to see that they're hitting the bridge," Police Chief Harris said.<br/>
警察局长哈里斯说：“他们会声称不知道自己撞到了桥上，但你会看到卡车停在桥中央，他们会抬头看到自己撞上了桥。”</p>
<p>Bill Caswell is president of the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges. He said trucks have damaged many covered bridges in Vermont and other states like Illinois and Ohio.<br/>
比尔·卡斯维尔是美国国家廊桥保护协会主席。他说，卡车损坏了佛蒙特州、伊利诺伊州和俄亥俄州等州的许多廊桥。</p>
<p>Caswell said trucks hit a covered bridge in Cobb County, Georgia, so many times that officials put metal barriers at each end of it. The bridge also has warning signs and flashing lights.<br/>
卡斯韦尔说，卡车多次撞上佐治亚州科布县的一座廊桥，以至于官员们在桥的两端都设置了金属护栏。这座桥还设有警告标志和闪光灯。</p>
<p>"Even with all the warnings, the barriers are still struck," Caswell wrote to The Associated Press. "But the bridge is now protected."<br/>
卡斯韦尔在给美联社的信中写道：“即使有了这些警告设施，护栏仍然被撞。但这座桥现在受到了保护。”</p>
<p>Back in Lyndon, the town is looking at plans to put a steel beam in front of the bridge. The beam would force trucks that are too tall to come to a stop.<br/>
说回林登，该镇正考虑在大桥前安装限高杆的计划。限高杆会迫使太高的卡车停车。</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said their Google Maps' app is made for drivers of cars and small trucks. The spokesperson added that drivers of larger vehicles should use different systems.<br/>
谷歌发言人表示，他们的谷歌地图应用程序是为汽车和小型卡车司机设计的。发言人补充说，大型车辆的驾驶员应该使用不同的系统。</p>
<p>Apple also has a "Maps" app. The company did not answer an Associated Press email asking for comment.<br/>
苹果公司也有“地图”应用程序。该公司没有回复美联社要求置评的电子邮件。</p>
<p>In Lyndon, there are different ideas in town about what to do, said Smith, the administrator.<br/>
行政长官史密斯表示，林登镇对该做怎么办意见不一。</p>
<p>"Some people obviously want to see something that protects the bridge so we can keep it in place," he said. "Others are like: ‘It's time to take it off and set it on the side and put a more standard bridge in."<br/>
他说：“有些人显然想看到对大桥做一些保护，这样我们就可以把它保护下来。其他人则想：‘是时候把它拆了放到一边，然后造一座更标准的桥了。’”</p>

<p>Theo works days, nights, and weekends in the tulip fields in the Netherlands and never <strong>complains</strong> of <strong>sore</strong> muscles.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>Theo is an artificial intelligence, or AI, robot that looks for diseased flowers each spring.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Theo the robot walks with his namesake checking Dutch tulip fields for sick flowers in Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands, Tuesday, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/e3d93c9a-7c98-4a7a-b3f8-90d67b396fe9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Theo the robot walks with his namesake checking Dutch tulip fields for sick flowers in Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands, Tuesday, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)</span></div>
<p>The work prevents viruses from spreading among the valuable plants. The robot looks for troubled tulip bulbs and destroys them if necessary. They are removed from the healthy ones in a processing center after the harvest.</p>
<p>There are 45 robots like Theo working in the tulip fields of the Netherlands. Their job becomes important as the winter turns to spring and <strong>peak</strong> season nears. People come from around the world to see the colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Allan Visser's family has been growing tulips for three generations. This is the second season that he has used a robot. He said it is very costly – the same as a sports car – about $200,000. In the past, knowledgeable farmers would walk the fields looking for tulips that showed signs of sickness.</p>
<p>"I prefer to have the robot because a sports car doesn't take out the sick tulips from our field," he said. "Yeah, it is <strong>expensive</strong>, but there are less and less people who can really see the sick tulips."</p>
<p>The robot has been trained to see the sick plants. Red <strong>stripes</strong> show up on the leaves of infected plants. The robots roll through the fields very slowly – about one kilometer per hour – looking for sick tulips.</p>
<p>Visser called the work "<strong>precision</strong> agriculture" as he explained how the robots work. He said the robots have cameras and take thousands of photos of the tulips. The AI software considers the photos and decides which tulips need to be killed.</p>
<p>"The robot has learned to recognize this and treat it," Visser said.</p>
<p>H2L Robotics is the company that makes the robots. Erik de Jong is the managing director. He said the robots use <strong>GPS</strong> coordinates to be sure they are killing the correct tulip among many tulips in the field.</p>
<p>He said all of the knowledge they use in the computer program that informs the robot comes from tulip farmers—farmers like Theo van der Voort. He is the farmer that the robot is named after.</p>
<p>Van der Voort retired after 52 years of looking for sick flowers in his fields.</p>
<p>"It's <strong>fantastic</strong>," he said. "It sees just as much as I see."</p>

<p>Senegal's only female presidential candidate may have little chance of winning Sunday's election, but activists say her presence alone is important. They argue that the candidacy of Anta Babacar Ngom is helping create gender equality in the West African nation.</p>
<p>Ngom is a 40-year-old business executive who runs her family's food company. She has made the economy a center of her campaign. Economic difficulty has driven thousands of Senegalese on sometimes dangerous travel in search of a better life outside Africa.</p>
<p>Ngom appears to be a voice for both women and young people - groups hard hit by unemployment and rising prices. She has promised to create millions of jobs and a bank for women. She says such actions will help women gain economic independence.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Presidential candidate Anta Babacar Ngom greets supporters during her electoral campaign caravan in Dakar, Senegal, Monday, March 11, 2024.

(AP Photo/Sylvain Cherkaoui)</span></div>
<p>She told The Associated Press, "The young girls I meet ask for my support. They do so because they know that when a woman comes to power, she will put an end to their suffering. I'm not going to forget them."</p>
<p>Ngom is the first female candidate to run for president in over 10 years. Few expect her to win. But activists say her candidacy demonstrates how women are moving ahead in the struggle for equality.</p>
<p>"We have to be there, even if we don't stand a chance," said Selly Ba, an activist and sociologist. "We don't stand a chance in these elections. But it's important that we have women candidates, women who are in the race."</p>
<p>Senegal had its first female prime minister in 2001. And in 2010, a law that required all political parties to introduce gender parity in elections helped increase female involvement in politics.</p>
<p>"Women's rights have <strong>evolved</strong> at the political level over the last 10 years and particularly since the gender<strong> parity</strong> law came into force," said Bousso Sambe, a former parliamentarian.</p>
<p>In 2012, two women ran for president, and while they earned less than one percent of the vote each, experts say their participation was important. Women in Senegal now make up more than 40 percent of parliament, one of the highest levels of representation in Africa.</p>
<p>Ngom told the AP, "Women must be able to express themselves without <strong>hindrance</strong>, while <strong>preserving</strong> our cultural identity and valuing the traditional values that have shaped our society."</p>
<p>Ngom's supporters say they are proud to back a female candidate and hopeful for a change in the next government.</p>
<p>"Our children are dying at sea because of unemployment and job insecurity," activist Aicha Ba said at a recent demonstration.</p>
<p>She added: "Women are tired."</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Lola.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3e2f-08dc483d48ff_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>I'm Lola from Madrid.</p>
<p>My question is about the pronunciation of the word "live". Sometimes the pronunciation is "liv" and others "laiv." The same with the word "lives." Why?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Lola. This is such a good question!</p>
<p>"Live" is an example of a heteronym, or words that have the same <strong>spelling</strong> but different <strong>pronunciations</strong> and meanings.</p>
<p>There are nearly 100 heteronyms in English. But let's get to your question about the word spelled l-i-v-e today.</p>
<p>It can be either an adjective, an adverb, or a verb.</p>
<p>When it is used as an adjective or adverb, we use the /a<i></i>618;/ sound, like "laiv."</p>
<p><em>I love <u>live</u> music.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you watching the game <u>live</u>?</em></p>
<p>When it is used as a verb, we use the /<i></i>618;/ sound, like "liv."</p>
<p><em>Where do you <u>live</u>?</em></p>
<p><em>We <u>live</u> just outside the city.</em></p>
<p>As for the word spelled l-i-v-e-s, it can be either a plural noun (from the singular "life") or third person singular verb.</p>
<p>When it is a plural noun, we use the /a<i></i>618;/ sound:</p>
<p><em>Cats have nine <u>lives</u>.</em></p>
<p>When it is used as third person singular, we use the /<i></i>618;/ sound.</p>
<p><em>She <u>lives</u> with her mother</em>.</p>
<p>So, in order to know which pronunciation to use for l-i-v-e and -s, you want to look carefully at how it is used in a sentence.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Lola.</p>

<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The American college basketball tournaments known as "March Madness" begin this week. College basketball, or National Collegiate Athletic Association (N.C.A.A.) basketball, is very popular in the United States. In parts of the country it is even more popular than professional basketball.</p>
<p>And, many people like to try to guess who will win the many games played over the next few weeks of competition. Sixty-seven games will be held for both men and women.</p>
<p>A <strong>chart </strong>that shows the <strong>sequence</strong> of games is called a bracket. Thousands of fans in the U.S. compete with each other to correctly predict the most outcomes of each game.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pittsburgh guard Ishmael Leggett, right, places a decal on the bracket after an NCAA college basketball game on March 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-79b6-08dc49ba9e8d_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pittsburgh guard Ishmael Leggett, right, places a decal on the bracket after an NCAA college basketball game on March 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)</span></div>
<p>Today, more people are using artificial intelligence, or AI, to help them fill their brackets. Using AI for bracketing in the tournament is not so new. Even so, the yearly bracket competitions still provide many surprises for computer science experts who have spent years creating their models using past tournament results.</p>
<p>The researchers have found that machine learning alone cannot quite solve for the limited data and unpredictable human elements of the tournament.</p>
<p>A normal fan may spend a few days this week deciding which team might win a few games in the tournament. But some computer experts are going after even more detailed information. They are using complex math to find the best model for predicting success in the tournament. Some are using AI to perfect their codes or decide which qualities of the team can best predict their competitive future.</p>
<p>The chances of creating a perfect bracket are extremely low for any competitor, however <strong>advanced</strong> their tools may be. An "informed fan" making choices based on past results has a 1 in 2 billion chance at perfection, says Ezra Miller. He is a mathematics professor at Duke University.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is likely very good at determining the <strong>probability</strong> that a team wins, Miller said. But even with the models, he added that the "<strong>random</strong> choice of who's going to win a game that's evenly matched" is still a random choice.</p>
<p>For the 10th straight year, the data science community Kaggle is hosting "Machine Learning Madness." In traditional bracket competitions, people simply write each team they think will win. But "Machine Learning Madness" requires users to enter a percentage representing their level of confidence that a team will advance.</p>
<p>Kaggle provides a large data set from past results for people to develop their <strong>algorithms</strong>. That includes information on a team's free-throw percentage, <strong>turnovers </strong>and assists. Users can then turn that information over to an algorithm to find the statistics most predictive of tournament success.</p>
<p>"It's a fair fight. There's people who know a lot about basketball and can use what they know," said Jeff Sonas. He is a statistical chess analyst who helped found the competition. "It is also possible for someone who doesn't know a lot about basketball but is good at learning how to use data to make predictions."</p>
<p>No method will include every element at play on the court. There is a balance between modeling and <strong>intuition</strong>, said Tim Chartier, a Davidson University bracket expert.</p>
<p>Chartier has studied brackets since 2009. He developed a method that largely depends on team success on home court and away, performance in the second half of the season and difficulty of <strong>schedule</strong>. But he said the NCAA Tournament's historical results provide an unpredictable and small<strong> sample</strong> size. That is a difficulty for machine learning models, which use large sample sizes.</p>
<p>Chartier's goal is never for his students to reach perfection in their brackets. His own model still cannot account for Davidson's 2008 unexpected admission into the "Elite Eight" level of the tournament.</p>
<p>In that mystery, Chartier finds a useful reminder from March Madness: "The beauty of sports, and the beauty of life itself, is the randomness that we can't predict."</p>

<p>India will begin the world's largest general election next month.</p>
<p>The process is expected to stretch over 44 days before results are announced on June 4. Nearly 970 million Indians – more than 10 percent of the world population – will be <strong>eligible</strong> to take part.</p>
<p>The voting process will choose 543 lawmakers to India's lower house of Parliament. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term in office. He will face off against an alliance of opposition parties struggling to unseat him. Most public opinion studies predict Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party will win.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Indian election officials and paramilitary soldiers with election materials walk along the river Brahmaputra to board on a country boat on the eve of the first phase of general election in Majuli, Assam, India.

<p>Here are some of the main facts to know about the election.</p>
<p><strong>Why will the election take so long?</strong></p>
<p>There are two main reasons the election will stretch on so long. One is that India is the world's most populous country. The other reason, experts say, is because it will be a huge <strong>logistical</strong> effort to make sure that every registered voter can take part in the process.</p>
<p>The voting process will take place over seven parts, or stages. The country's 28 states and eight federal territories will vote at different times. Each stage will last one day, with the first held on April 19 and the last held on June 1.</p>
<p>Voters in some states will <strong>cast</strong> their ballots over a day, while in other places it may take longer. Uttar Pradesh, the largest state with 200 million people, will vote over a period of seven days, for example.</p>
<p>During the election, voting stations will be set up in <strong>remote</strong> places. This will include a wildlife refuge in southern Kerala state and another in a shipping container in western Gujarat state.</p>
<p><strong>How is security a concern?</strong></p>
<p>Experts say one main reason for the multi-stage election is to improve security.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of federal security forces will be deployed during the voting. The guards, including those who usually guard borders, will be sent along with state police to prevent violence and to transport electoral officials and voting machines.</p>
<p>Deadly clashes involving supporters of competing political parties harmed past elections. But such violence has eased over the years, thanks to heavy security.</p>
<p>The Indian government's elections chief, Rajiv Kumar, said recently, "Look at the geography of the country ... there are rivers, mountains, snow, jungles ... think of the security forces' movements. They will have to travel through the length and breadth of the country."</p>
<p>Kumar added, "We will <strong>walk the extra mile</strong> so voters don't have to."</p>

<span class="datetime">21 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>An area stretching across Argentina, Bolivia and Chile forms what is called the "Lithium Triangle." The earth there is rich in lithium, a necessary metal in creating <strong>batteries</strong> for electric cars and other products.</p>
<p>The international effort to develop technologies that do not use oil, gas or coal requires huge amounts of lithium. But small native communities in the Lithium Triangle are worried. They fear their way of life will disappear as industry pushes for new lithium mines. The mining takes place in low, dry areas known as "salt flats."</p>
<p><strong>Stories from Argentina</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The town of Tusaquillas, in the northern Argentine province of Jujuy, sits near the Guayatayoc salt lagoon, background, on April 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Victor R.

<p>Irene Leonor Flores de Callata is 68 years old. She lives in a desert area of Argentina where she keeps llamas and sheep. The life includes searching for fresh water on a usual basis.</p>
<p>Her town is one of 38 that surround salt flats called the Guayatoyoc Lagoon and Salinas Grandes. People in the area earn some money from vacationing visitors and salt harvesting. They are a native people known as the Kolla.</p>
<p>Flores de Callata worries that if the mining expands in her area, there will be no water. She said: "What will we do if we don't have water? If the mines come, we'll lose our culture, we won't be left with anything."</p>
<p><strong>Lithium's value</strong></p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2023, the price for one ton of lithium almost tripled in the U.S., reaching $46,000. In China, a main buyer of lithium reportedly paid $76,000 for one ton of the metal last year. Some call the metal "white gold."</p>
<p>Mining companies around the world are turning their attention to the Lithium Triangle. World leaders are also pushing for lithium production. In the United States, President Joe Biden said he aimed to have electric vehicles make up half of all sales in America by 2030. That would amount to about 8 million electric vehicles. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said: "Argentina is <strong>poised</strong> to play a critical role in building supply <strong>chains</strong> for critical minerals that will drive the economy of the 21st century, particularly things like lithium."</p>
<p>Although prices have recently dropped because of oversupply, experts say worldwide demand is likely to rise in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental concerns in Chile</strong></p>
<p>Two lithium mining companies operate in Chile, which borders Argentina to the west. SQM is a Chilean business and Albermarle is an American one. Valentín Barrera, a spokesman for SQM, said lithium is an answer to the problem climate change. "We want to grow, understanding that it's needed to <strong>mitigate</strong> climate change."</p>
<p>In Chile, SQM pumps thousands of liters of salt water out of the ground and then lets the water dry out in <strong>pools</strong>. The solids in the salty water contain lithium. The pools <strong>evaporate,</strong> leaving a solid substance that is collected and purified.</p>
<p>Environmentalists, however, are concerned that the mining in the area will harm animals like flamingos and other life. As in Argentina, mining has brought criticism and legal cases. Local people want influence in decisions about the land.</p>
<p>In 2016, an investigation of SQM found that the company had used more water in their mining process than the law permitted. Later, the company was ordered to pay $51 million to mitigate damage caused by six incidents, including the polluting of fresh water wells.</p>
<p>Barrera said the court actions and criticism come from "disinformation." He blamed the state-run copper mines, which also use a lot of water.</p>
<p>An Albermarle spokesperson said the underground salt water "is not water" because it is not drinkable.</p>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) spoke to a number of scientists. They said it is hard to believe that industrial water use does not affect the environment. They said water pumping can pollute fresh water with salty water and dry out the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Ingrid Garcés studies water at Chile's University of Antofagasta. She said the salt flats are important for different kinds of animal and plant life. She said the water in the salt flats is not drinkable but is connected to other water sources and is important to natives.</p>
<p>A 2020 report from the United Nations said that mining has used up 65 percent of the water in Chile's Atacama Salt Flat causing pollution and environmental damage, causing natives to leave "ancestral settlements."</p>
<p>In April of 2023, Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced a plan to increase government control of lithium mines. The government told the AP the plan would help control water use and spread wealth to more people. The move had the effect of pushing mining companies to invest in neighboring Argentina.</p>
<p><strong>An opportunity and contradiction</strong></p>
<p>Miguel Soler is secretary of mining in northern Argentina. He said, "In Argentina, (Chile's decision) is an <strong>opportunity</strong>."</p>
<p>More than 30 companies are officially seeking permission to mine in the Guayatoyoc Lagoon and Salinas Grandes areas in Argentina. Local people are opposing the business effort.</p>
<p>The llama herder Flores de Callata and her native Kolla people have fought against mining and brought long legal battles to halt projects in the past also.</p>
<p>"We are guardians of the highlands," said Flores de Callata, "We defend our land..."</p>
<p>Last summer, the local government changed laws to limit the ability of groups to protest against the expansion of mining. Alicia Chalabe, an environmental lawyer representing the communities, said the change to local law violates international law. She said there is a lot of "pressure to <strong>exploit</strong> lithium for electric vehicles." But she added, while lithium is important worldwide, "so is the resistance of these communities. They're not alone."</p>
<p>Flores de Callata lives in the small town of Tusaquillas next to the wide salt flats where mining might take place in the future. She has a small group of farm animals and lives in a home with dried mud walls that she and her husband built. She wonders what will be left in 20 years.</p>
<p>"If the mines come, we'll have money for a time. But then our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren—they're the ones who will suffer," she said.</p>
<p>Generations of Ramon Torres' family herded goats near a town close to Chile's Atacama Salt Flats. But when companies started mining lithium in the early 1980s, Torres took a job as a miner and started saving money.</p>
<p>Today, he uses his wireless phone as he sits next to his small home. He bought the house and his device with his earnings from mining.</p>
<p>"There is development, but there's also the water issue. And they <strong>contradict</strong> each other," Torres said. "Because everyone needs money, everyone also needs the basics, like healthcare and education."</p>

<p>In an earlier <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we talked about "Fast Car," a song about young people who had dreams of making their lives better. Then, we asked our readers and listeners to tell us about their own dreams.</p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will review two answers we received, both from people in their middle years of life, and we give some grammar advice.</p>
<p><strong>Jairo's dream</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-dc69-08dc48330aaa_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>First, we want to thank Jairo, a middle-aged man who wrote to us. He said,</p>
<p><em>"Today everyday grammar topic is about dreams, how can I describe my dream? This is an interesting topic over all for people who already has <strong>certain</strong> age, like me; as well, the time is not longer for following an eternal dream..."</em></p>
<p>Jairo used an interesting expression to tell us about his age. He said, "people who already has certain age." You might have heard this expression in sentences like:</p>
<p><em>A person of a certain age needs to be concerned about retirement funds.</em></p>
<p>Note that the verb "has" is not used, but the preposition "of" is used before "a certain age." As you can guess, this is a <strong>polite</strong> way to describe someone in their 40s, 50s, or 60s. It is often used to talk about women's age without saying how old they are. Sometimes it comes before criticism, so take care in using it.</p>
<p><strong>Time is growing shorter</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Jairo said, "the time is not longer for following an eternal dream." We suggest using, "the time is growing shorter" or "there is little time left." Jairo could say,</p>
<p><em>The time for me to follow my dream is growing shorter.</em></p>
<p>Jairo continues to tell us about what is now important to meeting his life goals.</p>
<p><em>"... for that reason I need to be focus on important things, indeed, buy a house, save money for my daughter's scholarship, save money for taking a vacations or save money to be prepare for my retirement time..."</em></p>
<p>In this statement, Jairo uses "be" before an infinitive verb form two times: "be focus" and "be prepare." We suggest using the adjective form in both:</p>
<p><em>I need to <u>be focused</u> on important things.</em></p>
<p><em>I need to save money to <u>be prepared</u> for my retirement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kaori's dreams</strong><br/>
Next, we review a message from Kaori, who is a middle-aged woman in Japan. She begins by saying what she dreamed as a young person, using the expression we heard in the song, "Fast Car" – "to be someone."</p>
<p><em>"When I was young, I strongly believed I would be someone in the future. I wanted to be the first female Prime Minister in Japan or an executive of the big famous company."</em></p>
<p>Kaori did earn a job at a company, but then marriage and children and culture forced her to quit working. She says:</p>
<p><em>"However, I didn't become anyone...I stopped my job and gave up my carrier. Do I regret my decision and my life? No. Not at all.</em></p>
<p>From the remaining part of Kaori's message, we find she was a success at being a mother, as her two daughters are in college. And she gained a part-time job that helped to pay their school costs when they were younger. The corrections to her message that we suggest are the spelling of "career" and how to say you have quit a job. We can say, "I stopped working," or "I quit working." But Kaori could also say, "I changed jobs," because being a homemaker and mother, although unpaid, is a full-time job. Kaori did all that while holding a part-time job.</p>
<p>Thinking of how her dream changed over time, Kaori writes:</p>
<p><em>My past dreams were only thinking, not real. I can say my own dreams have changed everytime. In the future, even if I become old, I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams at anytime.</em></p>
<p>Two words in this part cause grammatical issues: "everytime" and "anytime." "Every time" should be written as two separate words, but a better way to say this would be:</p>
<p>I can say my own dreams have changed over the years.</p>
<p>"Anytime" is an adverb, so it should not appear after the preposition "at." Instead, Kaori could say,</p>
<p><em>I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams anytime.</em></p>
<p>Or she could use a different expression:<em> </em></p>
<p><em>I hope to find new and enjoyable dreams my whole life long.</em></p>
<p>Thank you, Kaori and Jairo, for writing to us and helping everyone to learn more about how we talk about our dreams. You both showed us that dreams can change over time as our lives become connected with those of others.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>!</p>

            <title>US Libraries Struggle to Pay for Costly Digital Books  (2024/3/21)</title>

<p>A growing number of American <strong>libraries</strong> are struggling to offer users digital versions of books because they cost a lot more than physical copies.</p>
<p>Public demand for digital materials – including books called e-books as well as audiobooks – has been rising at U.S. libraries since the COVID-19 pandemic. But libraries have had difficulties meeting demand. This has forced many librarians to put users on waiting lists to borrow digital materials.</p>
<p>Associated Press (AP) reporters recently spoke with library officials about the problem. One library they visited was in the community of West Haven, Connecticut. There, library workers noted big cost differences between physical and digital books.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman stands among the bookshelves in the main reading room of The New York Public Library, December 14, 2004. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5a63-08dc48ee0be8_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman stands among the bookshelves in the main reading room of The New York Public Library, December 14, 2004. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)</span></div>
<p>Most libraries are currently not permitted to buy e-books for a set price like individuals who purchase them online. This is because libraries offer the books to many people to borrow.</p>
<p>One example is a work by bestselling writer Robin Cook. A physical, hard copy version of Cook's latest book costs the West Haven Library $18 to buy, the AP reports. But the cost of <strong>leasing</strong> a digital copy of the same book costs the library $55.</p>
<p>Library officials told the AP lease prices are set by book publishers and generally cannot be re-negotiated. Such leasing agreements end after a limited time. Usually this means the lease lasts for up to two years or until it has been borrowed a set number of times. The cost of the leases is putting financial pressure on libraries.</p>
<p>Officials at West Haven Library told the AP they do not have a large budget. But they said they had to spend more than $12,000 over the past three years to lease 276 additional digital books that were not available within a larger library network.</p>
<p>The officials said 84 of those books were no longer available. And they noted that if the same $12,000 had been spent on paper books, the amount would have paid for about 800 copies.</p>
<p>"Imagine if a playground was built at a school with tax dollars, only to be taken down after two years of use," librarian Colleen Bailie said at a recent public hearing on the issue.</p>
<p>Publishers say their agreements with libraries are fair. They say that, while libraries pay a higher lease rate, they can make the books available to many users over time.</p>
<p>Librarians in several states have been pushing for legislation to reduce high costs and restrictions on digital materials. This year, lawmakers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Hawaii and New Hampshire all proposed bills aimed at lowering costs.</p>
<p>But the measures have faced strong opposition from the publishing industry. The industry argues the proposals do not effectively respect <strong>intellectual property</strong> owned by copyright holders and would harm the publishing businesses.</p>
<p>Libraries Online Inc. is a digitally connected library group operating in Connecticut. The organization says it currently spends about $20,000 a month on e-books for its 38 members. The cost of renewing <strong>expired</strong> e-books takes about 20 percent of the group's budget, e-book committee chair Rebecca Harlow told the AP.</p>
<p>"If we replaced all of the content that has expired this year, the cost would <strong>exceed</strong> our entire annual budget for e-books," Harlow recently told lawmakers. "We have completely lost the ability to build a library collection," she added.</p>
<p>In Illinois, a legislative proposal would cancel contracts between libraries and publishers that include certain rules. These include restricting a library's right to decide loan periods for <strong>licensed</strong> electronic material. Massachusetts and Connecticut are considering similar proposals.</p>
<p>Last year, groups representing publishers, booksellers and writers formed a group – the Protect the Creative Economy Coalition – to oppose state measures.</p>
<p>But Julie Holden, assistant library director for the Cranston Public Library in Rhode Island, said she thinks legislative action is needed. Otherwise, local librarians will continue to face financial pressure and will need to keep examining long lists of expiring digital leases to decide which ones can be replaced.</p>
<p>Holden added, "Taxpayers who fund our public libraries <strong>deserve</strong> better. Way better."</p>

            <title>Marriages in South Korea Rise Slightly after Years of Decrease  (2024/3/21) | 韩国结婚率去年小幅增长</title>

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202403/marriages-in-south-korea-rise-slightly-after-years-of-decrease.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The number of marriages in South Korea rose in 2023 for the first time in more than ten years.<br/>
2023年韩国结婚人数出现十多年来的首次增长。</p>
<p>The increase came after the pandemic which forced some couples to delay marriage plans. But the data did not point to a continued increase in the aging country.<br/>
这一增长出现在疫情迫使一些夫妇推迟结婚计划之后。但该数据并未指向老龄化国家结婚率的持续增长。</p>
<p>The small rise in marriages last year comes as its fertility rate continued to decrease. South Korea's fertility rate, or the average number of children born per woman, is already the world's lowest. It is falling because women are concerned about their careers, the cost of raising children, or are deciding not to have babies.<br/>
去年韩国结婚率小幅上升之际，其生育率持续下降。韩国的生育率，即每个妇女平均生育的孩子数量，已经是全球最低。下降的原因是女性担心自己的职业、抚养孩子的成本，或者决定不生孩子。</p>
<p>Government data showed a total of 193,657 couples got married last year. That is up 1.0 percent from 191,690 a year earlier. It is the first increase since 2011.<br/>
韩国官方数据显示，去年共有193657对夫妇结婚。这比前年同期的191690对增长了1.0%。这是自2011年以来的首次增长。</p>
<p>That compares with a 0.4 percent drop in 2022. That was when South Korea started to ease restrictions on social gatherings put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restrictions saw the number of marriages decrease 9.8 percent in 2021 and 10.7 percent in 2020.<br/>
相比之下，2022年下降了0.4%。当时韩国开始放松新冠大流行期间对社交聚会的限制。这些限制见证了2021年和2020年的结婚人数分别减少了9.8%和10.7%。</p>
<p>The 2023 number of marriages, however, remains well below the 239,159 marriages seen in 2019. And that compares to a yearly number of more than 320,000 recorded 10 years earlier.<br/>
然而，2023年的结婚人数仍远低于2019年的239159人。相比之下，10年前录得的年度数据超过32万。</p>
<p>A government official said that couples delaying marriage was a reason for more marriages in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023.<br/>
一位政府官员表示，推迟结婚是2022年下半年和2023年上半年结婚人数增长的原因之一。</p>
<p>"In the second half of 2023, however, marriages fell year-on-year, indicating that people who had been delaying marriage due to COVID-19 have now mostly got married," the official told reporters.<br/>
这位官员告诉记者：“然而，2023年下半年，结婚人数同比下降，这表明因新冠肺炎而推迟结婚的人现在大多结婚了。”</p>
<p>The 2023 increase was also well below the increases seen in nearby China. Marriages in China rose 12.4 percent last year. That happened as more couples got married after delays caused by the pandemic.<br/>
韩国2023年的增幅也远低于近邻中国的增幅。去年，中国的结婚人数增长了12.4%。随着越来越多因疫情推迟的夫妇结婚，这种情况发生了。</p>
<p>Most South Koreans say high housing costs are the biggest reason for getting married. Many also see marriage as the first step before having a baby in the Asian country.<br/>
大多数韩国人表示，高昂的房价是他们结婚的最大原因。在这个亚洲国家，许多人还将结婚视为生孩子前的第一步。</p>
<p>The Yonhap news agency reported a recent study of 500 South Koreans aged between 19 and 23. It showed that 50.4 percent of those asked did not plan on getting married or having children.<br/>
韩联社报道了最近一项针对500名年龄在19岁至23岁之间的韩国人的研究。调查显示，50.4%的受访者没有结婚或生孩子的打算。</p>
<p>The government says it will take "extraordinary measure" to deal the low birth rate. Political parties are promising public housing and easier loans for young South Koreans ahead of the April legislative election.<br/>
政府表示将采取“非常措施”应对低出生率问题。各政党承诺在4月国会选举之前为韩国年轻人提供公共住房和更容易的贷款。</p>
<p>Marriages with a foreign national greatly increased for a second year, increasing 18.3 percent to 19,717.<br/>
涉外婚姻连续第二年大幅增长，去年增长了18.3%到19717对。</p>

            <title>Aid Groups: Gaza, Haiti Are Facing Famine  (2024/3/21)</title>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Aid groups warn that famine, a widespread lack of food, will soon strike two troubled places: Gaza and Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>In Gaza</strong></p>
<p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an organization that follows hunger worldwide.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Palestinians line up to receive free meals at Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip on Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Essa)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2cf3f060-acf6-40c5-99af-57d99c3dad9c_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Palestinians line up to receive free meals at Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip on Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Essa)</span></div>
<p>On Monday, the group warned that more than one million Gazans could face famine if Israel expands its offensive in the southern city of Rafah. About half of the territory's people are crowded into the city. The report says almost all of them are struggling to get enough food already.</p>
<p>"This is the largest number of people facing <strong>imminent</strong> famine in the world today, and it has only taken five months to <strong>occur</strong>," said Matthew Hollingworth, the acting World Food Program country director for the Israeli-occupied territories.</p>
<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the expected famine "entirely manmade," adding, "starvation is used as a weapon of war."</p>
<p>Aid groups say that international efforts to ship food by air and sea are too small and too few. The IPC reported that famine could happen in Gaza any time between now and May if fighting does not stop.</p>
<p><strong>In Haiti</strong></p>
<p>In Haiti, four million people need help with food and about 1.4 million others are on the edge of famine, reports the United Nations World Food Program.</p>
<p>Aids organizations compared the situation in Haiti to a war <strong>zone</strong>. Criminal groups, or gangs, control many parts of the country and prevent aid from reaching its people.</p>
<p>Only a few aid organizations have been able to restart operations shut down since February 29. That is when gangs began to attack. They burned police stations, shut down airports and raided prisons, freeing more than 4,000 prisoners.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks later, Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced that he would resign from office.</p>
<p>Haitian citizen Erigeunes Jeffrand spoke to the Associated Press about the conditions in his country. He said he used to make a living selling sugar but the recent gang activity ended that. Criminals forced Jeffrand and his four children to flee their neighborhood.</p>
<p>"My home was completely destroyed and robbed," he said. "They took everything I have. And now, they're not even letting me work."</p>
<p>Jean-Martin Bauer is the Haiti director for the World Food Program. He said last week, "We have supplies for weeks. I'm saying weeks, not months." Bauer added, "That has me terrified."</p>
<p><strong>What is famine?</strong></p>
<p>The IPC was developed in 2004 during the famine in Somalia. Worldwide, the group says nearly 158 million people face crisis hunger situations or worse.</p>
<p>The group says famine is when an entire population or a sub-group of a population is without food, possibly causing death in the short term.</p>
<p>In famine, 20 percent of households would have an extreme lack of food, 30 percent of children would suffer from severe malnutrition and at least two adults or four children per every 10,000 people would die each day because of starvation, malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p>While the depth of the food crises in Haiti and Gaza is new, the underlying conditions are not, said Tobias Stillman, a director of the aid group Action Against Hunger, via email.</p>
<p>Even before the war, 80 percent of Gazans depended on humanitarian aid and about half of all households did not have enough food, he said. In Haiti, millions were already dealing with emergency levels of hunger and crisis levels of food need.</p>
<p>Death from starvation can come "surprisingly quickly," Stillman said. Without food, the body uses carbohydrates and fats first. When those are gone, muscle and organs begin to break down. Body systems, including <strong>digestion</strong>, start shutting down, which makes it harder to take in nutrients. Many times, people without food die of common infections. If that does not happen, organs shut down and the heart stops.</p>
<p>Children younger than five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, old people and people with underlying health problems are most at risk.</p>

            <title>Taliban May Never Reopen Girls’ Secondary Schools  (2024/3/21)</title>

<p>An Afghan education official says the ruling Taliban group might permanently close girls' secondary schools. The official said the Taliban is instead supporting religious schools known as madrasas.</p>
<p>The Taliban shut down girls' secondary schools in 2022. The group gave "religious and cultural" concerns as the reasons.</p>
<p>Taliban officials defend the ban. They say they are working to create a correct educational environment for older female students.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The benches of a school sit empty in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f802-08dc479b32e5_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The benches of a school sit empty in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022.

<p>"Schools may never be reopened the way they were under the occupation," an official at Afghanistan's Education Ministry told VOA. The official was referring to 2001 to 2021, when the U.S. military was in the country.</p>
<p>The official said there is no major difference between a traditional school and a madrasa. The official did not wish to be named because the Taliban have banned its members from speaking to VOA. The official added that madrasas serve the purpose of education just as well as traditional schools.</p>
<p>However, the United Nations and human rights workers worry that madrasas cannot fully replace traditional schools. They say madrasas deal too much with religious studies and do not teach enough subjects.</p>
<p><strong>U.N. concerns about madrassas</strong></p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed this worry in a report to the U.N. Security Council this month. He said the madrasas do not prepare boys or girls well enough for higher education and professional training. Students need "higher-level" education and training "to join an effective workforce in the future," he added.</p>
<p>The U.N. reports there are over 7,000 registered madrasas in Afghanistan with about 380 for girls. Taliban officials have said there are no age limits for girls attending the religious schools.</p>
<p>In his report, Guterres noted that employing new teachers for madrasas has continued. In July 2023, the leader of the Taliban ordered the hiring of 100,000 new madrasa teachers by the end of last year, the report said.</p>
<p>Pashtana Dorani is a U.S.-based Afghan women's education activist. She said the Taliban has already replaced traditional schools with religious ones. "They have created their own system," Dorani told VOA.</p>
<p>In addition to closing secondary schools for girls, the Taliban has banned women from most jobs. The group also does not permit women entry to some public places like parks and sport centers.</p>
<p>Last year, the all-male Taliban cabinet banned women's <strong>beauty parlors</strong>. Taliban officials say their rules agree with what Afghans want for the future.</p>
<p>Last year, education ended for more than 330,000 Afghan girls as they passed grade six exams. Aid agencies said they joined more than 3.7 million girls who are banned from secondary schooling.</p>
<p>Experts worry about the long-term effects of the Taliban's education policies. Afghanistan has one of the highest levels of maternal deaths during childbirth in the world. Experts warn that restricting education will lead to even worse public health problems.</p>
<p>The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, estimates keeping girls out of schools causes $500 million in economic losses for Afghanistan each year.</p>
<p>The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until October 2001. After 20 years of war, they returned to power in August 2021.</p>

<p>March 20 is the United Nations' International Day of Happiness.</p>
<p>For many years, northern European countries, especially Finland, have been named among the happiest countries on Earth. The United States has never made it into the top 10.</p>
<p>But California state lawmaker Anthony Rendon is hoping he can do something about happiness in the most populous American state.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Assemblyman Anthony Rendon walks with his daughter Vienna before being sworn in as Speaker of the Assembly during the opening session of the California Legislature in Sacramento, Calif., Monday, Dec. 5, 2022.

<p>In his free time, Rendon likes to stay away from the workplace and spend time with his 4-year-old daughter at his home near Los Angeles. Recently, he took her ice skating and to an indoor play area. He said those are the "things that make me happy."</p>
<p>As one of the longest-serving leaders in the California legislature, Rendon is now trying to make happiness more central to policymaking in his last year in office. He created a first-in-the-nation group to study the issue of happiness. The group is called the Select Committee on Happiness and Public Policy Outcomes.</p>
<p>Rendon said it would be "silly" for lawmakers to not study how they can make people happier. "Because if we have everybody clothed, everybody housed, everybody has a job and they're <strong>miserable</strong>, then we've failed at what we're trying to do," he said.</p>
<p>In California, three-quarters of adults say they are "very happy" or "pretty happy." Twenty-six percent say they are "not too happy." The numbers come from a September 2023 study by the Public Policy Institute of California. The study also says Californians without a post-high school degree and those who earn less money are generally less happy than those with more education and more money.</p>
<p>The idea of considering happiness in public policy is not new.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation of Bhutan sets happiness as a goal of its public policy. The country asks its people about their level of happiness for what is called the Gross National Happiness Index. Officials then work to increase happiness by providing citizens with free health care and education. They also work to protect things like cultural traditions and the country's forests.</p>
<p>Phuntsho Norbu is consul general of Bhutan to the United States. Norbu said the government cannot make every person happy. But he said the government should "create the right conditions" to help people find happiness.</p>
<p>In California, lawmakers recently heard from experts about the things that make people happy and how public officials can support people's happiness.</p>
<p>Meliksah Demir is a professor of happiness at California State University, Sacramento. Demir said research shows that <strong>leisure</strong> activities, social relationships and life situations affect a person's happiness. He added that public officials can help by investing in mental health resources, adding green spaces and teaching about the value of happiness early on in schools.</p>
<p>Rendon said California is behind many parts of the world in looking at happiness in policymaking. He said he wanted to create the happiness committee after seeing a yearly report on happiness by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Last year's happiness report said that the way people <strong>view</strong> the effectiveness of government can influence their happiness. The United States was 15th in the world happiness <strong>ranking</strong> based on a three-year average from 2020 to 2022. Scandinavian countries, including Finland and Iceland, ranked the highest.</p>
<p>Kristina Bas Hamilton is a long-time labor supporter in California. "Government's role is to provide for its people," Bas Hamilton said. "The goal is to have happy citizens. That's the goal of all public policy."</p>

<p>A nonprofit group has identified more than 1,500 books that local schools in America have banned from their libraries and classrooms in 2022-2023.</p>
<p>The free-speech activism group PEN America is based in New York City. The group said the number represented a 33 percent increase from the year before. The American Library Association (ALA) says that there were more attempts to ban books from schools last year than ever before.</p>
<p>Moms for Liberty is a parental rights group based in Florida. The group has supported efforts to bar certain books from school libraries around the country. Group co-founder Tiffany Justice told the television network NewsNation last year that many books in school libraries are not right for children or teenagers and are harmful.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Banned Books Week display is at the Mott Haven branch of the New York Public Library in the Bronx borough of New York City on Saturday, October 7, 2023.

<p>"Public school children — K through 12 — do not have <strong>unfettered</strong> access to the internet at school, or movies, or music," Justice said. "But somehow these books with these horribly <strong>explicit</strong>, graphic content are finding their way onto bookshelves in public schools all over America."</p>
<p>Gay Ivey is a professor of literacy at University of North Carolina- Greensboro. She and her research partner Peter Johnston from the University of Albany have studied students' <strong>motivations</strong> to read. They also have studied how students react to reading young adult literature. Ivey said school boards and policymakers do not agree about the purpose of reading in school.</p>
<p>Ivey and Johnston said they found that reading books considered "<strong>disturbing</strong>" by students was <strong>beneficial</strong> for their learning and emotional development. The two said parents also noticed a growth in their children after they read the disturbing books.</p>
<p>In one of Ivey and Johnston's studies, they spent a year in a middle school in an eastern town. They asked eighth grade students in an English class to choose any book they wanted to read.</p>
<p>The teens read the books during class time. They were not under any pressure from teachers to finish the book or to produce any schoolwork about the book. The researchers later spoke to 71 of the students about their experiences reading the books they chose. They also spoke to their parents and teachers.</p>
<p>Many of the students chose to read books that deal with difficult subjects like depression, suicide, illegal drug use, or sexual <strong>exploitation</strong>. Some of the books students chose were ones that schools around the country have banned. These books included <em>Thirteen Reasons Why</em> by Jay Asher, <em>Identical</em> by Ellen Hopkins and <em>Sold</em> by Patricia McCormick.</p>
<p>Ivey told VOA that students are <strong>drawn to</strong> books that deal with troubling subjects. Instead of being harmed by such subjects, reading about <strong>fictional</strong> <strong>characters</strong> made them more <strong>empathetic</strong>, she said. Ivey said they also were more thoughtful about the characters' motivations and actions. The researchers found that reading made the students happier, and helped some heal from sadness or depression. The difficult nature of the books made the students more likely to discuss the subjects with teachers, parents and friends.</p>
<p>The students in the study read books "that kind of throw you <strong>off</strong>-<strong>kilter</strong> that make you want to talk to somebody else," Ivey said. "The social interaction around it was really important, including talking to parents and teachers."</p>
<p>The subjects covered in the books may make both kids and adults uncomfortable. But Ivey said she and Johnston "came to realize that what really matters is the meaning that the kids make out of the books, not adults' meanings that they make. Which are often times really <strong>off-base</strong>."</p>
<p>Ivey said reading texts with difficult and troubling subject matter makes students more involved readers and learners. Students are able to relate to characters facing difficult decisions and think about how they would react to a situation described in the book.</p>
<p>Ivey and Johnston interviewed one teacher who said books that dealt with drugs, sex, and other issues made it easier to discuss those subjects in class. Discussions about books, "made it a safe way to kind of get into these things," the teacher said.</p>
<p>Reading disturbing books also made students more likely to learn as a group, the researchers said.</p>
<p>With the troubling texts, sometimes it is "really necessary to grab everybody around you and put all heads around it and teach each other," Ivey said. "More and different kinds of learning happens in those situations."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Information from this year's IQAir World Air Quality Report shows only seven countries met the World Health Organization's (WHO) pollution recommendations in 2023.<br/>
今年发布的《IQAir世界空气质量报告》的信息显示，2023年，只有七个国家符合世界卫生组织的污染建议。</p>
<p>The report said the five countries with what it called the lowest air quality had particle levels at least nine times higher than what the WHO recommends.<br/>
该报告称，空气质量最差的5个国家的颗粒物水平至少是世界卫生组织建议的9倍。</p>
<p>Three South Asian countries – Bangladesh, Pakistan and India – had the world's lowest air quality, the report said.<br/>
报告称，孟加拉国、巴基斯坦和印度这三个南亚国家的空气质量是全球最差的。</p>
<p>The information comes from the Swiss company IQAir, which makes air quality-related products. The report used measurements from over 30,000 stations across 134 countries.<br/>
这些信息来自瑞士IQAir公司，该公司生产空气质量相关产品。该报告使用了来自134个国家的30000多个台站的测量数据。</p>
<p>IQAir uses the WHO standard of PM2.5 to measure the size of breathable pollutant particles in the air. The PM2.5 measurement means the particles are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. The diameter of human hair, for example, is about 30 times larger than a particle of 2.5 microns.<br/>
IQAir采用世界卫生组织的PM2.5标准来测量空气中可呼吸污染物颗粒的大小。PM2.5的测量意味着颗粒物的直径为2.5微米或更小。例如，人类头发的直径大约是2.5微米颗粒的30倍。</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the concentration of PM2.5 particles reached 79.9 micrograms per cubic meter in 2023. In Pakistan, the number was 73.7. The WHO recommends a reading of no more than five micrograms.<br/>
在孟加拉国，2023年PM2.5颗粒物浓度达到每立方米79.9微克。在巴基斯坦，这一数字为73.7微克。世界卫生组织建议读数不超过5微克。</p>
<p>Christi Chester Schroeder oversees air quality science for IQair. She said South Asia's geography influences its air quality. She warned about the future.<br/>
克里斯蒂·彻斯特·施罗德负责IQair的空气质量科学。她说，南亚的地理位置影响其空气质量。她对未来提出了警告。</p>
<p>"Because of the climate conditions and the geography...the pollution has nowhere to go," she said.<br/>
她说：“由于气候条件和地理位置,污染无处可去。”</p>
<p>She added that because of "agricultural practices, industry and population density...it really does look like it is going to get worse before it gets better."<br/>
她补充道，由于“农业活动、工业和人口密度，情况看起来确实会在好转之前变得更糟。”</p>
<p>India's level was 54.4, Tajikistan in Central Asia was 49.0 and Burkina Faso in West Africa was the fifth-most polluted nation at 46.6.<br/>
印度的PM2.5水平为54.4，中亚的塔吉克斯坦为49.0，西非的布基纳法索为46.6，是污染第五严重的国家。</p>
<p>The only countries that met the WHO pollution recommendations were Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius and New Zealand.<br/>
符合世界卫生组织污染建议的国家只有澳大利亚、爱沙尼亚、芬兰、格林纳达、冰岛、毛里求斯和新西兰。</p>
<p>Of the 134 countries and regions measured, 124 had higher levels than called for in the WHO pollution guidelines.<br/>
在测量的134个国家和地区中，有124个国家和区域的污染水平高于世界卫生组织污染指导标准的要求。</p>
<p>Both Bangladesh and India's air quality decreased in 2023. In 2022, India was eighth and Bangladesh was fifth.<br/>
2023年，孟加拉国和印度的空气质量都有所下降。2022年，印度排名第八，孟加拉国排名第五。</p>
<p>Firoz Khan is an air pollution expert at North South University in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He said 20 percent of the early deaths in the country are caused by air pollution. He said spending on pollution-related healthcare was equal to four to five percent of the nation's economy.<br/>
菲罗兹·汗是孟加拉国达卡市南北大学的空气污染专家。他说，该国20%的早期死亡是由空气污染引起的。他说，与污染相关的医疗保健支出相当于全国经济的4%到5%。</p>
<p>In India, New Delhi's measurement of 92.7 micrograms made it the most-polluted capital city.<br/>
在印度，新德里的测量值为92.7微克，是污染最严重的首都。</p>
<p>Three countries that were on the list in 2022 were removed in 2023 because of problems collecting information. They were Chad, Iran and Sudan. Chad was the world's most polluted country last year.<br/>
2022年上榜的三个国家在2023年因信息收集问题被删除。他们是乍得、伊朗和苏丹。乍得去年是世界上污染最严重的国家。</p>
<p>IQAir provides its report each year. But many countries do not have public air quality measurement systems. Christa Hasenkopf is the director of the Air Quality Life Index at the University of Chicago. She said that is a big problem, "considering the large potential benefits and relatively low cost."<br/>
IQAir每年都会提供报告。但许多国家没有公共空气质量测量系统。克里斯塔·哈森科普夫是芝加哥大学空气质量生命指数的主任。她说，“考虑到巨大的潜在效益和相对较低的成本，这是一个大问题。”</p>
<p>She suggested a global effort to make air quality information more available, "especially in places where the health burden of air pollution has been largest."<br/>
她建议全球努力提供更多的空气质量信息，“尤其是在空气污染对健康负担最大的地方。”</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This story is one of the winning entries from the "Teach Us about Ukraine" writing contest sponsored by VOA Learning English and GoGlobal.</em></p>
<p>My name is Olha Balukh, and I have been teaching English for 19 years in Vinnytsia, Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a small corner of Lyceum 20, a type of school comprising primary and secondary ones, in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, students, teachers and community members recently gathered as the aroma of food wafted through the air.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Woman makes a delicious Ukrainian national food, varenyky with raspberry. (Adobe Stock Photo by tan4ikk)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-bb0c-08dc3f8cf1c1_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpeg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Woman makes a delicious Ukrainian national food, varenyky with raspberry. (Adobe Stock Photo by tan4ikk)</span></div>
<p>It was not just a usual school event. It was a celebration of varenyky, the beloved Ukrainian dumplings.</p>
<p>Varenyky is much more than a delicious Ukrainian dish. The food represents the heart and soul of a nation. It is a sign of hospitality, unity, and tradition, making it perfect for a school festival to bring people together.</p>
<p>Every year, schools across Ukraine come alive with the spirit of unity when different festivals are organized. This year, the festival in the Lyceum served several purposes. In addition to bringing the community together, it was organized to provide much-needed assistance to children in need and the brave men and women in the army.</p>
<p>Due to the war a lot of people, especially children, were forced to flee from the eastern parts of the country. They lost their parents and friends, houses and other belongings. So, they need both psychological and financial help.</p>
<p>In a perogy festival, students, parents, and teachers worked to prepare several kinds of foods, including dumplings. The school became a center of culinary creativity, with everyone working together to create the tastiest varenyky. The place of education became a colorful market decorated with pumpkins and snowball trees. Food and dumplings included many fillings, from classic potato and cheese to sweet fruit-filled varieties, salmon, ricotta, herring, and beans.</p>
<p>Beyond food, the perogy festival was also a beacon of hope for those who need it most.</p>
<p>Children, who are often the most vulnerable members of society, received support from this festival. Andriy Nazarenko (grade 5-D) moved to Vinnytsia from Bakhmut. This town is completely destroyed nowadays. He was excited to take part in the event.</p>
<p>"I did not expect to get such support from my new teachers and classmates. I am really touched," said the boy.</p>
<p>Money raised from the festival also went to soldiers who defend the nation and provide equipment and supplies for the Ukrainian military.</p>
<p>Through their involvement in the festival, students learned that they can make a difference in the world, no matter their age.</p>

            <title>Report: Thousands More Chemicals in Plastics than Estimated  (2024/3/19)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A recently released report from European scientists says there are 16,000 chemicals in plastic materials around the world.</p>
<p>The report said not enough is known about the safety of all those chemicals. They estimate that about 25 percent of these chemicals are possibly harmful to human health or the environment.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Research Council supported the creation of the report. It was released as officials are negotiating a United Nations treaty on plastic pollution. The U.N. estimates 400 million metric tons of plastic waste are produced every year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A soldier pauses while cleaning plastic and other debris on the shores of Montesinos beach, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic July 19, 2018.

<p>Jane Muncke helped write the report. She is with the Swiss nonprofit Food Packaging Forum. She said to deal with plastic pollution, people must look at the "full <strong>life cycle</strong> of plastics."</p>
<p>Researchers fear chemicals from plastics can spread into water and food.</p>
<p>Muncke said, "We're finding hundreds, if not thousands, of plastic chemicals in people now and some of them have been linked to <strong>adverse</strong> health outcomes."</p>
<p>Activists say such effects include possible harm to the reproductive system and <strong>cardiovascular</strong> disease.</p>
<p>Martin Wagner is the lead writer of the study. He is an environmental scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He said researchers find hundreds, if not thousands, of chemicals in everyday products when they look for them.</p>
<p>Kimberly Wise White is with the American Chemistry Council, an industry group. She said the findings "ignore real-world <strong>exposures</strong>." She added the findings "paint an incomplete picture" for policy makers and the public. The plastics industry has said any worldwide treaty should support <strong>recycling</strong> and re-use of plastic.</p>
<p>But the writers of the recent report said that only dealing with plastic waste does not go far enough. They said there is a need for more information on chemicals in plastics, including recycled products. About 25 percent of the chemicals found lacked information on their chemical identity, the report said.</p>
<p>Wagner said the problem "is the chemical complexity of plastics." He is a leading member of the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. It is an organization of scientists and experts seeking to advise the plastics treaty process.</p>
<p>Wagner said, "Often producers don't really know which kind of chemicals they have in their products and that comes from very complex value chains."</p>
<p>Six percent of the chemicals found in plastics are <strong>regulated</strong> internationally. Wagner said that without regulations, there is no reason for companies to identify what is in the plastics.</p>
<p>Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said there were around 13,000 chemicals in plastics.</p>
<p>Negotiations will continue in Ottawa, Canada. The aim is to finish a version of a treaty by December in the South Korean city of Busan.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>In 2021, the U.S. food and drug agency approved the drug Wegovy for weight loss. Now, the Food and Drug Administration (or, FDA) says the drug can reduce the risk of death from stroke or heart attack in adults who have <strong>cardiovascular</strong> disease or are overweight.</p>
<p>The FDA approved a usage change requested by drugmaker Novo Nordisk. The change expands the use of semaglutide, the general or <strong>generic</strong> name of the drug. Wegovy is the brand name given by the company that sells it.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pictured here is an injection pen of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy.

<p>The FDA based its decision on the results of a study that found Wegovy cut the risk of serious heart problems. The study also found that overweight patients with heart disease but not diabetes were 20 percent less likely to experience those problems. Researchers compared the results of patients who took the drug with those who took a <strong>placebo</strong>, or inactive injections.</p>
<p>Wegovy is the first medication approved to help prevent possibly life-threatening disease in overweight people, the agency said.</p>
<p>Dr. John Sharretts directs the FDA's Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity. He said, "Providing a treatment <strong>option</strong> that is proven to lower this cardiovascular risk" is good for public health.</p>
<p>Dr. Martha Gulati said the decision will change the way many heart patients are treated. Gulati is a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The research also confirms that the new class of obesity medications are useful for improving health, not just losing weight.</p>
<p>"The hope is that insurers will start understanding that this is not a <strong>vanity </strong>drug," Gulati said. So-called vanity drugs are drugs that serve no medical purpose. Some researchers call them "lifestyle" drugs. Gulati estimates that nearly 70 percent of her heart patients could be <strong>eligible </strong>for treatment.</p>
<p>Wegovy is a high-<strong>dose</strong> version of the drug Ozempic. Ozempic is a diabetes treatment. The FDA approved the drug to cut the risk of serious heart problems in people with disease. The weight-loss drug costs about $1,300 a month.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk has also asked European Union officials to expand the use of the drug for heart problems.</p>
<p>The FDA warned that Wegovy carries the risk of serious side effects. These included thyroid <strong>tumors</strong> and certain cancers. Other possible side effects can include low blood sugar. Organs in the body can be affected such as the pancreas, gallbladder, kidney, or eye. Another possible side effect is suicidal behavior or thinking.</p>
<p>The <strong>clinical trial, </strong>which resulted in the drug's approval, involved more than 17,600 people. About one third of them reported serious side effects. About 17 percent of the group that took Wegovy and about eight percent of those who received a placebo left the study because of reported side effects.</p>
<p>The new approval could mean that Medicare might increase coverage to the drug. Medicare is the federal health coverage program for retirement-aged citizens. U.S. law bars Medicare from covering drugs for weight loss alone. Recent estimates say nearly $3 billion was spent in 2021 covering Ozempic to treat diabetes.</p>
<p>Tricia Neuman is a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco that researches health policy. She said the change "... will open the door to allow more people on Medicare to gain access to Wegovy."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans said private health coverage companies will consider the new guidance for Wegovy.</p>
<p>Drugmakers and activists for lower <strong>obesity</strong> rates have been pushing for expanded coverage. This includes legislation that would require Medicare to pay for the obesity drug. The cost of the drug needs to be balanced by reduced spending on medical care related to obesity and heart disease.</p>
<p>Another problem is a limited supply of the drug. The FDA said there has been a shortage for more than a year. Novo Nordisk officials said they are aiming to increase production.</p>
<p>For Gulati, the heart specialist, wider use cannot come soon enough.</p>
<p>"Everybody (is) waiting to get this medication," she said. "Lower the cost, do (not) be <strong>greedy </strong>and make sure the drug is available for use."</p>

            <title>Vernal Equinox Marks Arrival of Spring  (2024/3/19)</title>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>This year, the vernal equinox officially arrives on Tuesday, March 19 at 11:06 pm in Washington, D.C. That is 3:06 UTC on Wednesday, March 20. At that time, the sun will be exactly above the Earth's equator.</p>
<p>The word vernal comes from the Latin word <em>vernalis</em>, meaning "of the spring." And equinox comes from the Latin words <em>aequus</em>, meaning equal, and <em>nox</em>, meaning night. The day has 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of nighttime.</p>
<p>And in the Northern Hemisphere, the day marks the beginning of spring.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People take photographs of cherry blossom trees that have begun to bloom, Monday, March 20, 2023, along the tidal basin in Washington, on the first day of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

<p>On this day, people living in colder areas of the Northern Hemisphere hope they can put away their winter clothes. They also may soon start planting flowers and vegetables in a garden.</p>
<p>Here in Washington, D.C., March 20 also marks the first day of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Each year, people from around the world come to see the beautiful pink and white blossoms on the thousands of flowering cherry trees. For Washingtonians, the cherry blossoms are a welcome sign that spring has arrived.</p>
<p>In ancient times, some cultures built structures to signal the start of spring. Around the year 1000 A.D., for example, the Maya built a <strong>pyramid </strong>in what is now Mexico's Yucatan. It sits within an ancient city called Chichen Itza.</p>
<p>On the spring equinox, the sunlight hits in a way that makes the structure look like a snake. The Maya called this day "the return of the Sun <strong>serpent</strong>."</p>
<p>Today, cultures worldwide have their own ways of identifying and celebrating the arrival of spring.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry blossoms</strong></p>
<p>In Japan, spring is marked with a huge cherry blossom festival, known as <em>hanami.</em> The tradition dates back more than a thousand years. People gather under the <strong>blooming </strong>trees to eat, drink tea, celebrate and enjoy the cherry blossoms, known as <em>sakura</em> in Japanese. Artists and poets celebrate the short-lived blooms as a symbol of beauty.</p>
<p>In 1912, Japan gave 3,000 cherry trees to the U.S. capital city of Washington, D.C. The gift was to honor the lasting friendship between the United States and Japan. </p>
<p><strong>Nowruz</strong></p>
<p>For many countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, the vernal equinox also marks the beginning of a new year. The celebration is called Nowruz. The words "now" and "ruz" mean "new day" in Farsi.</p>
<p>Countries along the ancient Silk Road trading path, including Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian nations, celebrate Nowruz.</p>
<p>In the past, Iran was the only country where Nowruz was an official holiday. But after countries gained their independence following the fall of the Soviet Union, many made Nowruz a national holiday, as well.</p>
<p>During Nowruz, people visit family members and friends and exchange gifts. Iranian families set up a "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nowruz-in-america/3774295.html" target="_blank">haft seen</a>" <strong>display</strong> of seven special items that represent spring and new beginnings.</p>
<p>In Uzbekistan and other places in Central Asia, people watch wrestling events, horse races and a special horseback game called, in Uzbek, <em>Kopkari</em>. In this game, two teams of players on horseback try to get the body of a headless goat into a goal. A similar game is called <em>buzkashi </em>in Afghanistan and <em>oghlak tartish </em>in Kyrgyzstan and Uyghur-speaking areas.</p>
<p><strong>Holi festival</strong></p>
<p>Many in India and Nepal mark the arrival of spring with the Holi festival, known also as the festival of colors or the festival of love.</p>
<p>This year, Holi will take place on March 25.</p>
<p>People celebrate the festival by covering each other in -- you guessed it -- colors! Children especially enjoy the festival, as they get to throw colored <strong>powder</strong> and water-filled balloons at others.</p>
<p>Some say the festival comes from a story of the burning of the devil Holika. It represents the victory of good over evil, or the arrival of spring after a long, dark winter.</p>
<p>Others say the celebration was inspired by the story of two young lovers with different skin colors. Krishna, who has blue skin, was in love with Radha. So, he colored Radha with paint leading to the modern-day colorful festival of love.</p>
<p><strong>Las Fallas</strong></p>
<p>People in Valencia, Spain, have their spring celebration called <em>Las Fallas</em>. It is a wild street festival involving fire.</p>
<p>The festival centers on the creation – and burning – of huge colorful <strong>statues</strong> made of wood, paper and plastic. The statues are meant to look like real people. Valencian communities and organizations work all year to create these structures and place them throughout the city, with fireworks inside.</p>
<p><em>Las Fallas </em>celebrations began on March 15, with events like bullfights, parades, and cooking and beauty competitions. Then, at midnight on March 19, the city turns off all its streetlights and the statues<em> </em>are set on fire.</p>
<p>This marks the end of the festival and the beginning of spring.</p>

            <title>Secrets of US Presidential Diaries  (2024/3/19)</title>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 March 2024</span><br/>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One early morning in Washington, D.C., many years ago, the president of the United States took off his clothes and jumped into the Potomac river. Moments later, he saw a dead man float to the surface.</p>
<p>The president was John Quincy Adams, the nation's sixth leader. And we know about the incident because he wrote about it in his diary.</p>
<p>A diary is a daily record of events of one's life, especially of personal experiences and thoughts.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Archivist of the U.S John Carlin stands behind a 1947 Harry Truman presidential diary, July 10, 2003, at the National Archives in Washington.

<p>American presidents from George Washington to Joe Biden, have been known to keep diaries. The men wrote about everyday experiences and thoughts. They also wrote about important decisions they made and the reasoning behind such decisions.</p>
<p>Adams called his diary his "second <strong>conscience</strong>." Barack Obama said his diary is a process of turning thoughts into writing that "makes you ask <strong>tougher</strong> questions."</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter left the White House with more than 5,000 pages of such notes. He said, "I seldom exercised any restraint on what I <strong>dictated</strong>."</p>
<p>Dwight Eisenhower wrote about disputes within a scientific advisory group and some of its proposals about Soviet atomic bombs. And Donald Trump's daily writing was seen by the public on Twitter, now known as X.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets in diaries</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the presidential diaries contain secrets that they should not.</p>
<p>Robert Hur was the special <strong>counsel</strong> who investigated Biden's handling of <strong>classified</strong> information after his time serving as vice president. He reported that Biden's diary contained notes from intelligence briefings, including some classified as "top secret."</p>
<p>The 1978 Presidential Records Act says that the U.S. government has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2202" target="_blank">"complete ownership, possession, and control"</a> of all presidential and vice presidential records. The act does not cover personal diaries. But classified information is not supposed to be in those.</p>
<p>Hur noted in his report that both Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush had classified information in their diaries.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan left the White House in 1989. He took with him eight years of handwritten diaries, the report says, "which he appears to have kept at his California home even though they contained Top Secret information."</p>
<p>Hur wrote, "Historically, after leaving office, many former presidents and vice presidents have knowingly taken home sensitive materials related to national security from their administrations without being charged with crimes."</p>
<p>Both Biden and former President Donald Trump have been investigated for their handling of classified information. But only Trump is being accused of resisting demands to return them.</p>
<p><strong>Values of diaries</strong></p>
<p>Students of history have always been interested in presidential diaries.</p>
<p>They "provide <strong>unique</strong> windows into the presidency, helping us better understand how policy is made and power is used," said Marc Selverstone, director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.</p>
<p>As for John Quincy Adams, all 15,000 pages of his diaries written over 68 years are available to the public. The Massachusetts Historical Society, which publishes them online, said his diaries represent "the longest continuous record of any American of the time."</p>
<p>On <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v49-1825-07-22-p865" target="_blank">July 22, 1825</a>, Adams wrote, "I <strong>stripped</strong> and went in to the river; I had been not more than ten minutes swimming when the drag boat started, and they were not five minutes from the shore when the body floated immediately opposite the rock; less than one hundred yards from the <strong>shore</strong>."</p>
<p>The entry noted the death of Mr. Shoemaker, a post office worker seen swimming about in the water earlier.</p>

            <title>Study Documents Headaches Experienced by Astronauts in Space  (2024/3/18) | 宇航员在太空中出现头痛</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Research in the growing field of space medicine has identified many ways in which zero-gravity and other conditions can affect the human body. Now, a new study finds that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known.<br/>
太空医学领域的研究已经确定了零重力和其他条件对人体产生影响的多种方式。现在，一项新的研究发现，宇航员在太空中比以前更容易出现头痛。</p>
<p>The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European and Japanese space agencies. They all traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.<br/>
这项研究涉及来自美国、欧洲和日本航天机构的24名宇航员。他们都在国际空间站上旅行了长达26周。除两人外，其他人都报告在太空中出现头痛。</p>
<p>Headaches struck a larger number of astronauts than the scientists had expected. The headaches continued even after the crew had been in space long enough for the body to adjust. The process takes place in the first two weeks in space.<br/>
头痛困扰的宇航员人数超过了科学家们的预期。即使乘员在太空中停留了足够让身体适应的时间，头痛仍在继续。这个过程发生在太空的前两周。</p>
<p>The headaches during the early period often presented similarly to migraines. Those experienced later in space travel presented more like a tension headache, the study found.<br/>
早期的头痛通常与偏头痛相似。研究发现，太空旅行者后期经历的更像是一种紧张性的头痛。</p>
<p>Neurologist WPJ van Oosterhout of Zaans Medical Center and the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands was lead author of the study. He said the research suggests different processes "are involved for the early headache episodes - the first one to two weeks in space - versus later headache episodes."<br/>
荷兰Zaans医学中心和莱顿大学医学中心的神经学家WPJ·范·奥斯特霍特是这项研究的主要作者。他说，研究表明，“在太空前一到两周出现的早期头痛发作与后期头痛发作涉及不同的过程。”</p>
<p>The study was published this week in the journal Neurology.<br/>
这项研究发表在本周的《神经病学》杂志上。</p>
<p>"In the first week, the body has to adapt to the lack of gravity, known as space adaptation syndrome. This phenomenon is similar to motion sickness, and can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness, and headaches," Van Oosterhout said. "The later headaches could result from ... more fluid accumulating in the upper part of the body and head...."<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说：“在第一周，身体必须适应重力不足，这被称为空间适应综合征。这种现象类似于晕动病，会导致恶心、呕吐、头晕和头痛。后来的头痛可能是由于更多液体积聚在身体上部和头部。”</p>
<p>Migraines experienced on Earth are often throbbing, and last four to seven hours, along with symptoms like nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound, Van Oosterhout said. Tension headaches on Earth usually are a dull pain felt over the whole head, he said.<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说，地球上经历的偏头痛通常是有规律性抽痛，它会持续四到七个小时，伴有恶心、呕吐、对光和声音敏感等症状。他说，紧张性头痛在地球上通常是一种感觉到整个头部的隐隐作痛。</p>
<p>The astronauts, 23 men and one woman, had an average age of about 47. They visited the International Space Station for missions that took place from November 2011 to June 2018. A total of 378 headaches were reported by 22 of the 24 astronauts during a total of 3,596 days in orbit. None of the 24 reported headaches in the three months after returning to Earth. None had ever had migraines before their time in space and none had a history of usual headache attacks.<br/>
这些包括23男1女的宇航员的平均年龄约47岁。2011年11月至2018年6月，他们访问了国际空间站执行任务。24名宇航员中的22人在总共3596天的轨道任务中总共报告了378次头痛。这24人在返回地球后的三个月内都没有报告头痛。在进入太空之前，没有人患过偏头痛，也没有人有常见的头痛发作史。</p>
<p>Documented effects of space travel include bone and muscle weakening, or atrophy, changes in the brain, cardiovascular system and immune system. Astronauts have also experienced effects on the inner ear and a condition involving the eyes. The risk of cancer from high radiation levels in space is another concern.<br/>
有文献记载的太空旅行的影响包括骨骼和肌肉减弱或萎缩、大脑、心血管系统和免疫系统的变化。宇航员还经历了内耳和眼睛的影响。太空中高辐射水平导致癌症的风险是另一个令人担忧的问题。</p>
<p>Experts are unsure how much of a barrier these effects might have on human space travel over long periods, like trips to Mars or beyond.<br/>
专家们不确定这些影响对人类长期太空旅行（如火星或更远的地方）可能会产生多大的影响。</p>
<p>"The honest answer is that we don't know the effects of long-duration space travel - possibly years - on the human body," Van Oosterhout said, adding, this "is a clear task for the field of space medicine."<br/>
范·奥斯特霍特说：“老实说，我们不知道可能几年的长时间太空旅行对人体的影响。”他补充道，这“是太空医学领域的一项明确任务。”</p>

            <title>North America Prepares for 2024 Total Solar Eclipse  (2024/3/18)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">17 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>A total solar eclipse will take place in North America on April 8. Millions of people will be able to fully experience the event, which is expected to darken the sky for more than four minutes.</p>
<p>A total solar eclipse happens when the sun, moon and Earth perfectly line up. This results in sunlight being blocked. The quality of the observations will depend on weather and the position where people watch the eclipse from.</p>
<p>The path of totality – meaning places where people will see a total blockage of the sun – will stretch across areas of Mexico, the United States and Canada. People in North America who are outside of this path will still be able to see a partial eclipse.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The progression of a total solar eclipse is seen with the moon passing in front of the sun above Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia, on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 1995. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-7e80-08dc446b2d55_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The progression of a total solar eclipse is seen with the moon passing in front of the sun above Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia, on Tuesday, Oct. 24, 1995. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)</span></div>
<p>The American space agency NASA says the eclipse will begin over the South Pacific and reach Mexico's Pacific coast at around 11:07 a.m. Pacific Time. It will then enter the United States in Texas.</p>
<p>The path of totality will then pass through a series of states before heading out from the northernmost state of Maine. The eclipse will enter Canada in Ontario and move across the nation before leaving northeastern Canada into the Atlantic.</p>
<p>An estimated 44 million people live inside the 185-kilometer-wide path of totality, with about 32 million in the U.S.</p>
<p>The eclipse is expected to last four minutes and 28 seconds, about twice as long as the one that darkened skies in 2017. The U.S. is not set to see another coast-to-coast total solar eclipse until 2045.</p>
<p>NASA's eclipse watch program is led by Kelly Korreck. She told The Associated Press the eclipse will permit many people to experience the "wonder of the universe without going very far."</p>
<p>People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial eclipse. The farther these people are from the path, the less the sun will be covered. For example, experts say Americans farthest from this path – such as in the northwestern cities of Seattle and Portland – will see about one-third of the sun blocked.</p>
<p>As was the case with past eclipse events, people are being warned about the dangers of looking directly at the sun during the event. Since normal sunglasses are not considered effective protection, special eclipse glasses are suggested for eclipse watchers. The glasses should only be removed during moments when the sun's face is covered during complete totality.</p>
<p>A total solar eclipse develops in several different parts, or stages. The event starts with a partial eclipse as the moon begins to pass between Earth and the sun. During this stage, a partial blockage leaves the sun looking a bit like a banana.</p>
<p>During the next stage, called Baily's Beads, points of light from the sun shine around the moon's edges. This effect is produced by the moon's differing <strong>landscapes</strong>. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/what-to-expect/">notes</a> this stage is quite short and "may not last long enough to be <strong>noticeable</strong> to all observers of the total solar eclipse."</p>
<p>In the Diamond Ring stage, a single bright spot appears along the lunar edge even as the sun's atmosphere leaves a ring of light around the moon. This effect – which comes right before totality – looks similar to a diamond ring.</p>
<p>After totality, the other stages then repeat as the moon keeps moving along its path until the end of the eclipse.</p>
<p>Total solar eclipses generally happen every few years, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse will arrive in 2026. It will be observable along the northern edges of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.</p>
<p>North America will not experience totality again until 2033, with that one only passing over Alaska. It will happen next in 2044, with totality limited to Western Canada and the U.S. states of Montana and North Dakota.</p>
<p>The next coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in the U.S. is expected to happen in 2045. NASA says that one will stretch from Northern California to Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>

            <title>Bird Flu Spread Increasing, Killing South American Wildlife  (2024/3/18)</title>

<span class="datetime">17 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading more aggressively than ever before since its arrival in South America in 2022. It is killing wild birds and marine mammals on the continent.</p>
<p>Reuters recently spoke to eight experts in bird flu science. All said the current spread raises the risk of the virus becoming a bigger threat to humans.</p>
<p>The more immediate concern is that the disease, which once affected mostly birdlife, appears to be spreading between mammals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A dead pig and a dead penguin lie on the Atlantic Ocean's coast, during a Bird Flu outbreak, in Sao Jose do Norte, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, November 21, 2023.

<p>The disease has already killed several dolphins in Chile and Peru. It has also killed about 50,000 seals and sea lions along the coasts and at least half a million birds across South America.</p>
<p>Scientists have not yet tested infections in living animals to confirm mammal-to-mammal passage of the virus. But they believe it is very likely.</p>
<p>"It's almost <strong>certainly</strong> happened," said Richard Webby. He is a virologist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. "It's pretty hard to explain some of these large infections and die off without having mammal-to-mammal spread."</p>
<p>The same version of the virus has appeared in many bird species. Among them are migrating species, scientists told Reuters.</p>
<p>As climate change continues, animals are forced to move into new territories, often mixing with animals -- and viruses -- that are new to them.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of time before you will <strong>detect</strong> the first South American strain in North America," said Alonzo Alfaro-Nunez, a viral ecologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Human risk</strong></p>
<p>The growing concern led the intergovernmental Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to gather health experts and officials for a meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>The group plans to launch the world's first <strong>regional</strong> program to supervise bird flu spread. The program will run observation and <strong>response</strong> efforts, a PAHO official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Since the virus was first detected in Colombia in October 2022, there have been two known cases in humans on the continent. One was in Ecuador. The other was in Chile. Birds passed the virus in each case.</p>
<p>The patients survived. But often, H5N1 kills. About 60 percent of human cases of the virus end in death.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is unlikely to raise the H5N1 risk level for humans from the current "low" right now. The experts would require evidence of human-to-human transmission or signs of viral changes that would target humans, experts said.</p>
<p>Several drugmakers have said they are developing bird flu vaccines for humans.</p>
<p>"We're seeing (the virus) do... little <strong>evolutionary</strong> steps that are on the long-term moving towards a <strong>potential</strong> human infection," said Ralph Vanstreels. He is a researcher at the University of California, Davis. He is studying South American variants of H5N1.</p>
<p><strong>Regional response</strong></p>
<p>With health officials and experts meeting in Rio this week, Latin American countries will be pressured to increase disease surveillance in the wild.</p>
<p>The region's data is lacking and limited resources have left scientists struggling to understand how the disease is spreading in the wild. Scientists expect the number of cases is probably much higher than reported. Some cases are not getting laboratory testing.</p>
<p>Bolivia, for example, did not register a case in the wild last year. But the disease has been reported in surrounding countries, said Manuel Jose Sanchez Vazquez, a disease expert for PAHO's animal health center.</p>
<p>Overseeing<strong> </strong>the disease response can also be complex, Sanchez noted. Public health officials deal with threats to humans. Agricultural experts and <strong>veterinarians</strong> deal with health threats to farm animals, including birds, cows and pigs. But for wild animal health, care and supervision is provided mostly by environmental officials.</p>
<p>The new regional commission is expected to be announced on Thursday. The group would aim to set methods for observing, treating and reporting cases among government agencies. It could also help in sharing laboratory resources.</p>
<p>"We are worried and we are <strong>vigilant</strong>," Sanchez said. "The more <strong>adaptation</strong> of the virus to mammals, the more likely it is that transmission to humans could happen."</p>

<p>My name is Nadiia Kyba. I am from Cherkasy. And this is my essay.</p>
<p>They come in white, red, orange, brown, and yellow. They are the flowers in the gardens of Ukraine. And they are the lessons that I learned from childhood.</p><p><img alt="FILE - A woman poses for a picture at a flower exhibition in Kyiv, Ukraine, August 21, 2015. (REUTERS/Gleb Garanich)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/352B5EC8-B177-4CCF-8AD0-5B32B8C7B41C_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman poses for a picture at a flower exhibition in Kyiv, Ukraine, August 21, 2015.

<p>As a child, I remember plenty of snowdrops in my grandmother's garden. The fragile petals managed to blossom despite a heavy snowstorm. I wanted to bring the white flowers into the house. But I was not permitted to step on them or to pick them. My parents said, "We must all cherish the snowdrops. There is no use in withered flowers."</p>
<p>Little did I know back then that snowdrops were very rare, and they almost disappeared. I did not know it was more important to have them in the garden. Luckily, there were people who knew better. They created a reserve in Kholodnyi Yar to protect and care for those beautiful white flowers. They taught me to care for and protect even the smallest things.</p>
<p>I lived in a village where children always helped to take care of its flowerbeds. At school, our class weeded beds of roses nearby. It was great fun to be outdoors in the fresh air. Moreover, the roses looked splendid. They smelled sweet in the sun, and girls used to pin them in their hair. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can still smell the beautiful roses.</p>
<p>The first time I worked in a bed of roses, I prickled my hand with small but sharp thorns. I did not know that such beauty could hurt you. I understood then that it took much pain to gain something so beautiful.</p>
<p>That was one of the most important lessons in my life. If I want something, I must be ready to work hard for it. The roses taught me to be persistent and hardy. And the roses showed me "no pain, no gain."</p>
<p>What comes to your mind when you hear the word "garden"?</p>
<p>I see marigolds. I see orange, brown, and yellow marigolds. There are so many marigolds in the gardens of Ukrainians, that it is hard not to notice them. People sing songs about marigolds. They are everywhere, under the apple trees, in the strawberries, near the fences, in the flowerbeds, and even on the roads.</p>
<p>I used to plant marigolds with my mother. We gathered the seeds in autumn. Then we shared and exchanged the seeds with our friends or neighbors. I have warm memories of my family sitting on the bench in front of the marigold beds. My father told stories. And we chatted and joked.</p>
<p>Marigolds remind me of home and the best moments of our lives. They taught me to share and communicate, to be a daughter and a friend.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is adding to the threat of election disinformation worldwide.</p>
<p>The technology makes it easy for anyone with a smartphone and an imagination to create <strong>fake </strong>– but convincing – content aimed at fooling voters.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, fake photos, videos or audio required teams of people with time, skill and money. Now, free and low-cost generative artificial intelligence services from companies like Google and OpenAI permit people to create high-quality "deepfakes" with just a simple text entry.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An advertising banner with a slogan about AI is fixed at a building at the Davos Promenade, alongside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1395462a-a385-4366-8108-5652f0125761_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An advertising banner with a slogan about AI is fixed at a building at the Davos Promenade, alongside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>Expanding threats</strong></p>
<p>A wave of AI deepfakes tied to elections in Europe and Asia has already appeared on social media for months. It served as a warning for more than 50 countries having elections this year.</p>
<p>Some recent examples of AI deepfakes include:</p>
<p>— A video of Moldova's pro-Western president throwing her support behind a political party friendly to Russia.</p>
<p>— Audio of Slovakia's liberal party leader discussing changing ballots and raising the price of beer.</p>
<p>— A video of an opposition lawmaker in Bangladesh — a conservative Muslim majority nation — wearing a <strong>bikini</strong>.</p>
<p>The question is no longer whether AI deepfakes could affect elections, but how influential they will be, said Henry Ajder, who runs a business advisory company called Latent Space Advisory in Britain.</p>
<p>"You don't need to look far to see some people ... being clearly confused as to whether something is real or not," Ajder said.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge to democracy</strong></p>
<p>As the U.S. presidential race comes closer, Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning about the growing threat of generative AI. He said the technology makes it easy for foreign groups to attempt to have a bad influence on elections.</p>
<p>With AI deepfakes, a candidate's image can be made much worse or much better. Voters can be moved toward or away from candidates — or even to avoid the polls altogether. But perhaps the greatest threat to democracy, experts say, is that the growth of AI deepfakes could hurt the public's trust in what they see and hear.</p>
<p>The complexity of the technology makes it hard to find out who is behind AI deepfakes. Experts say governments and companies are not yet capable of stopping the problem.</p>
<p>The world's biggest tech companies recently — and voluntarily — signed an agreement to prevent AI tools from disrupting elections. For example, the company that owns Instagram and Facebook has said it will start <strong>labeling</strong> deepfakes that appear on its services.</p>
<p>But deepfakes are harder to limit on apps like Telegram, which did not sign the voluntary agreement. Telegram uses <strong>encrypted </strong>messages that can be difficult to uncover.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about efforts to limit AI</strong></p>
<p>Some experts worry that efforts to limit AI deepfakes could lead to unplanned results.</p>
<p>Tim Harper is an expert at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, DC. He said sometimes well-meaning governments or companies might crush the "very thin" line between political commentary and an "<strong>illegitimate </strong>attempt to<strong> smear </strong>a candidate."</p>
<p>Major generative AI services have rules to limit political disinformation. But experts say it is too easy to defeat the restrictions or use other services.</p>
<p>AI software is not the only threat.</p>
<p>Candidates themselves could try to fool voters by claiming events that show them in bad situations were manufactured by AI.</p>
<p>Lisa Reppell is a researcher at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>She said, "A world in which everything is suspect — and so everyone gets to choose what they believe — is also a world that's really challenging for...democracy."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked closely at a piece of wood? If you have, you might have noticed its beautiful grain.</p>
<p>When talking about wood, grain describes the appearance of cell fibers in the wood. A wood's grain is important when choosing the right sort of wood for a project. Different kinds of wood have different grains, which affect their appearance, strength, and usefulness.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this picture taken on August 19, 2023, a worker crafts a Kashmiri willow wood cricket bat at a factory in Kashmir's Sangam village. (Photo by Tauseef MUSTAFA / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f6d2-08dbbe55a392_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - In this picture taken on August 19, 2023, a worker crafts a Kashmiri willow wood cricket bat at a factory in Kashmir's Sangam village. (Photo by Tauseef MUSTAFA / AFP)</span></div>
<p>Paying attention to a wood's grain helps you to know how to work with it. For example, if you are cutting a wood <strong>board</strong> with the grain, you would use a tool called a rip saw. If you are cutting across the grain, you would use a crosscut saw.</p>
<p>Cutting against the grain is more difficult. If you work against the wood grain, you might tear out pieces of wood or even damage your tools.</p>
<p>And that brings us to our expression: <u>to go against the grain.</u></p>
<p>If you go against the grain, you do something differently from what is normal or usual.</p>
<p>An idea or action that goes against the grain is difficult to do or accept. Usually, it goes against a person's ideals, beliefs, or principles.</p>
<p>If an idea or action goes against the grain, it is the opposite of what you believe is right or normal. You might find it difficult to accept. In some situations, it takes courage to go against the grain of what others are saying or doing and stand up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>Let's say a friend of yours is offered a sales job. To do the job well, he must <strong>convince</strong> people to buy things they don't need. He is a very honest man. So, for him this job goes against the grain.</p>
<p>To go against the grain can also mean to do things differently from others. Sometimes we want to go against the grain. We don't want to do things the way everyone else does. Artists often try to go against the grain and ignore the common, popular <strong>trends </strong>of the day.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear the expression used between two friends.</p>
<p><em>A: Did you hear about Jenny taking that corporate banking job? </em></p>
<p><em>B: I did! I'm really happy for her. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Happy? You must be kidding. Jenny is an artist. In college, we used to protest against big banks.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I know we did. But life is different now. We're older and have bills to pay. And I think Jenny wants to send her little sister to college. </em></p>
<p><em>A: I know. But a corporate job? Jenny? It just goes against the grain for her. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Look, we need to support our friend. Anything less would go against the grain for me.</em></p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>

            <title>India Implements Much-debated New Citizenship Law  (2024/3/17)</title>

<p>India has put into effect a new law that makes it easier for non-Muslim minorities to seek Indian citizenship.</p>
<p>The much-debated law was first approved by India's parliament in 2019. But the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delayed <strong>implementing</strong> the measure because of huge protests by groups opposed to it.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the law shortly after it was approved in December 2019. At the time, news organizations reported at least 23 people were killed during days of protests.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Students protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Guwahati, India, Tuesday, March 12, 2024.

<p>The law seeks to give Indian citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and other minorities who fled Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to escape mistreatment based on religion. Muslims are not covered by the law.</p>
<p>Modi's Hindu nationalist-led government has said the law is designed to ease the suffering of many people who long faced unfair treatment in India. Critics say the measure is a government attempt to <strong>marginalize</strong> India's 200 million Muslims.</p>
<p>A message issued by the prime minister's office confirmed the new law had been activated. "The Modi government announces implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act," a spokesperson wrote in a text message.</p>
<p>The measure is an important policy of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The spokesperson said the measure clears the way "for the <strong>persecuted</strong> to find citizenship in India."</p>
<p>A statement by the Home Ministry said the law aims to remove legal barriers to citizenship for refugees in order to provide a "<strong>dignified</strong> life" to those who have long suffered in India.</p>
<p>The statement added that "many <strong>misconceptions</strong>" had been spread among the public about the law. "This Act is only for those who have suffered persecution for years and have no other shelter in the world except India," it said.</p>
<p>The government said citizenship seekers can begin the process by entering their information online through an official website.</p>
<p>Human rights group Amnesty India criticized implementation of the law, saying it "<strong>legitimizes</strong> discrimination based on religion."</p>
<p>Opponents have argued that if the law aims to protect persecuted minorities, it should have included Muslim religious minorities. The critics say these groups – including Ahmadis in Pakistan and Rohingyas in Myanmar – have already faced persecution in their own countries.</p>
<p>The opposition Communist Party of India – which rules the southern state of Kerala - called for state-wide protests to demonstrate their opposition to the measure.</p>
<p>Kerala's Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said in a statement he sees the law leading to more divisions and believes it is not in line with the country's constitution. "This move to <strong>stratify</strong> Indian citizens who have equal rights, must be opposed unitedly."</p>
<p>India's 200 million Muslims make up a large minority group in the country's 1.4 billion population. Muslims live in almost every part of the country. They have been targeted in a series of attacks since Modi first came to power in 2014.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A new study examines possible harm caused by microscopic pieces of plastic that end up inside people's bodies.<br/>
一项新的研究考察了最终进入人体的微小塑料碎片可能造成的危害。</p>
<p>These materials – known as microplastics and nanoplastics – can enter the body through the air or in food or drinks.<br/>
这些材料被称为微塑料和纳米塑料，它可以通过空气、食物或饮料进入人体。</p>
<p>Tiny plastic pieces have received widespread attention in the media. But so far, very little research has been done on how the substances affect human heart health.<br/>
微小的塑料制品受到了媒体的广泛关注。但到目前为止，关于这些物质如何影响人类心脏健康的研究很少。</p>
<p>One new study suggests the buildup of such plastics inside the body can increase the risk of a stroke, heart attack or death. But the researchers noted the evidence presented cannot prove a direct link between tiny plastic materials and heart problems.<br/>
一项新的研究表明，这种塑料在体内的堆积会增加中风、心脏病发作或死亡的风险。但研究人员指出，所提供的证据无法证明微小塑料材料与心脏问题之间的直接联系。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What did the study find?<br/>
该研究有何发现？</span></p>
<p>The study involved 257 people who had medical operations to clear blocked blood vessels in their necks. Italian researchers examined the fatty buildup the doctors removed from the carotid arteries, which supply blood and oxygen to the brain.<br/>
这项研究涉及257人，他们接受了清理颈部堵塞血管的医疗手术。意大利研究人员检查了医生从为大脑提供血液和氧气的颈动脉中清除的脂肪堆积物。</p>
<p>Using two methods, they found evidence of plastics – mostly nanoplastics that cannot be seen – in the artery plaque of 150 patients. No evidence of plastics was seen in 107 patients.<br/>
他们采用两种方法，在150名患者的动脉斑块中发现了塑料的证据，其中大部分是看不见的纳米塑料。在107名患者中没有发现塑料的迹象。</p>
<p>The team followed these people for three years. During that time, 30 individuals, or 20 percent of the group with plastics, had a heart attack, stroke, or died from any cause. These rates dropped to about eight percent among those with no evidence of plastics.<br/>
这个团队对这些人进行了为期三年的跟踪调查。在此期间，发现塑料的群体中有30人，占比20%，发生了心脏病、中风或死于各种原因。在那些没有塑料证据的群体中，这一比例降至8%左右。</p>
<p>Research results were recently published in a study in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br/>
研究结果最近发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》上的一项研究中。</p>
<p>The researchers also found more evidence of inflammation in individuals with tiny plastic bits in their blood. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury and is thought to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes.<br/>
研究人员还发现了血液中有微小塑料碎片的人出现炎症的更多证据。炎症是身体对损伤的反应，它被认为会增加心脏病发作和中风的风险。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the problems with the study?<br/>
这项研究有什么问题？</span></p>
<p>The researchers admitted their study was very small. For example, it only looked at people with narrowed arteries who were already at risk for heart attacks and stroke.<br/>
研究人员承认他们的研究规模很小。例如，它只观察了动脉狭窄的人群，这些人已经存在心脏病发作和中风的风险。</p>
<p>And the patients with the plastics had more heart disease, diabetes and high cholesterol than those without plastics. They were also more likely to be men and more likely to be smokers. Both of those groups generally have higher rates of heart disease.<br/>
检出塑料制品的患者比没有检出塑料制品的患者更容易发生心脏病、糖尿病和高胆固醇。他们也更有可能是男性，更有可能是吸烟者。这两组人通常都有较高的心脏病发病率。</p>
<p>The researchers tried to account for these risk differences. But they noted they may have missed some important elements that could change the results. The team said because of these ongoing questions, this kind of study cannot prove the plastics caused the health problems.<br/>
研究人员试图解释这些风险差异。但他们指出，他们可能错过了一些可能改变结果的重要因素。该团队表示，由于这些持续存在的问题，这类研究无法证明塑料导致了健康问题。</p>
<p>Steve Nissen is a heart expert at the Cleveland Clinic in the state of Ohio who was not part of the study. He told the Associated Press he thinks the team's estimate that the risk of heart attack, stroke or death was four times greater seems too high.<br/>
史蒂夫·尼森是俄亥俄州克利夫兰诊所的心脏病专家，他没有参与这项研究。他告诉美联社，他认为该研究小组估算心脏病发作、中风或死亡的风险高出四倍，这似乎太高了。</p>
<p>"It would mean that these microplastics are the most important cause of coronary heart disease yet discovered. And I just don't think that's likely to be right," Nissen said.<br/>
尼森说：“这意味着这些微塑料是迄今为止发现的导致冠心病的最重要原因。我只是认为这不太可能是对的。”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is next for the researchers?<br/>
研究人员的下一步是什么？</span></p>
<p>Philip Landrigan of Boston College University told the AP that more research is needed on the issue. Landrigan, who wrote about the study in the Journal, said it is the first one suggesting a connection between microplastics and nanoplastics with disease in humans. Other scientists have found plastic bits in the lungs, liver, blood, placenta and breast milk.<br/>
波士顿学院大学的菲利普·兰德里根告诉美联社，需要对这个问题进行更多的研究。兰德里根在《华尔街日报》上撰文谈到了这项研究，他说这是第一个表明微塑料和纳米塑料与人类疾病之间存在联系的研究。其他科学家已经在肺、肝、血液、胎盘和母乳中发现了塑料碎片。</p>
<p>"It does not prove cause and effect, but it suggests cause and effect," Landrigan said. "And it needs urgently to be either replicated or disproven by other studies done by other investigators in other populations."<br/>
兰德里根说：“它不能证明因果关系，但它启发了因果关系。它迫切需要被其他研究人员在其他人群中进行的其它研究所重复或推翻。”</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic's Nissen added about the study, "It's a wake-up call that perhaps we need to take the problem of microplastics more seriously. As a cause for heart disease? Not proven. As a potential cause? Yes, maybe," Nissen said.<br/>
克利夫兰诊所的尼森在谈到这项研究时补充道，“这是一个警钟，也许我们需要更认真地对待微塑料问题。作为心脏病的病因？尚未被证实。作为潜在病因？是的，也许。”</p>

            <title>The Wild Winter Sport of Skijoring  (2024/3/16)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>What do you get when you cross the sports of <strong>rodeo</strong> with skiing? An extreme winter sport called skijoring.</p>
<p>The competition involves riding horses that <strong>tow</strong> skiers by rope over jumps and around barriers. At the same time, competitors try to <strong>lance</strong> round targets with a baton, a special stick for the purpose.</p>
<p>Skijoring is a winter sport that celebrates the combination of rodeo and ski culture in the U.S. Mountain West.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A skijoring team competes in Leadville, Colo., on Saturday, March 2, 2024.

Skijoring draws its name from the Norwegian word skikjoring, meaning "ski driving." (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)</span></div>
<p>Horses — and sometimes dogs, snowmobiles and even cars — tow skiers by rope at speeds as high as 64 kilometers per hour. Skiers can go over jumps as high as 2.4 meters.</p>
<p>One of the most popular skijoring races in the country takes place in Leadville, Colorado. The event, called "The Granddaddy of 'em All," has been a tradition there since 1949.</p>
<p>"It's just the pure <strong>adrenaline</strong> that gets me to do it," said Nick Burri. He is one of the competitors and said teams get along with each other. "Getting these two different groups of people together with the riders and the skiers...we <strong>mesh</strong> pretty well."</p>
<p>Internet reports say skijoring takes its name from the Norwegian word skikjoring, which means "ski driving." It started as a way to get around in Scandinavia and became popular in Europe's Alps Mountains around 1900.</p>
<p>Today's sport is dangerous, and injuries are common among riders and skiers alike. One of the first riders in the Leadville race earlier this month fell off his horse and had to be helped off the track.</p>
<p>Burri did well in the competition although he was skiing with a separated shoulder that he suffered in a fall during a race two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Savannah McCarthy has been a competitive skijorer since she was 12 years old. She said she experiences a nervous energy before she rides her horse for a race. But once she is speeding down the course, her world goes silent.</p>
<p>"I don't hear a thing when I'm running," she said. "When it's happening, you really don't have time to think about anything." McCarthy is a 24-year-old financial worker from Durango, Colorado. She has won the Leadville race nine times.</p>
<p>Loren Zhimanskova is head of Skijor USA, which helps organize races across the country. She said skijoring is becoming more popular because of social media. She hopes it will one day be an event in the Winter Olympics. Skijoring is especially popular in Poland and Switzerland, as well as in the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.</p>
<p>Five years ago, the sport had about 350 teams of riders, skiers, and horses in the U.S., she said. Now, about 1,000 teams are competing, and the number of races has increased from about 15 a year to more than 30.</p>
<p>But getting the sport into the Olympics has proven difficult.</p>
<p>There is no official governing body. It has no clear set of rules. And there is no system that would permit riders to take part in the Winter Games. In addition, every course is different, and every race has its own special traditions.</p>
<p>Zhimanskova is pushing to include skijoring as a non-competitive demonstration sport. She said it could also be included in the <strong>torch</strong> <strong>relay</strong> at the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>"Everyone loves snow...and then you add horses to that," Zhimanskova said. "I mean, all the elements that go into a skijoring event, in my opinion, are really feel-good elements," she added.</p>

            <title>Using 'Just' and 'Only'  (2024/3/16)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gena Bennett</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Mohammad.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>What is the difference between just and only?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Using 'Just' and 'Only'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-2d6e-08dc442cb5c6_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Using 'Just' and 'Only'</span></div>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Mohammad. This is a good question.</p>
<p>In an earlier <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/just-and-only/5408390.html" target="_blank">explained</a> how the two words, "just" and "only," seem to mean the same thing. For example:</p>
<p><em>She was <u>just</u> a baby when she came to America.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>She was <u>only</u> a baby when she came to America.</em></p>
<p>In that article, we also explained how the two words have different meanings and when you should use one and not the other. The difference in usage is so small that you might not even notice at first. But it is very important.</p>
<p>So, let's look at more ways to use the two words today.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>Usage is the way in which a word or phrase is normally used.</p>
<p>The word "only" can be used in an undesirable situation. For example:</p>
<p><em>He <u>only</u> finished half his homework.</em></p>
<p><em><u>Only</u> two banks stay open after 4 p.m.</em></p>
<p><em>You're <u>only</u> coming on Saturday? I wish you could come earlier.</em></p>
<p>Its usage is also common when we are not happy about something:</p>
<p><em>It's <u>only</u> right that they get the same pay for the same work.</em></p>
<p><em>The noise is fine, <u>only</u> if it does not hurt my ear.</em></p>
<p>However, we use the word "just" when we want to make an <strong>emphasis</strong>, or a stronger statement. Let's compare the last two examples with these:</p>
<p><em>It's <u>just</u> not right that he gets more pay for the same work.</em></p>
<p><em>The noise hurts my ear. <u>Just</u> be quiet, please!</em></p>
<p>In spoken English, believe it or not, we also use "just" when we want to make something smaller or less important.</p>
<p>For example, when someone thinks the distance is too far, we might say:</p>
<p><em>Your friend lives <u>just</u> down the road.</em></p>
<p>If they do not have a lot of time, we might ask:</p>
<p><em>Can you wait <u>just</u> a minute?</em></p>
<p>And when someone appears to be busy, we might say:</p>
<p><em>Could I <u>just</u> ask you something?</em></p>
<p><em>I was <u>just</u> wondering, can we meet tomorrow?</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Mohammad.</p>

            <title>What Is Pi Day?  (2024/3/15) | 什么是圆周率日</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Math lovers celebrate Pi Day on March 14, or 3/14. Around the world, many people even mark the day by eating a tasty piece of pie.<br/>
数学爱好者在3月14日庆祝圆周率日。在世界各地，许多人甚至通过吃一块美味的馅饼来纪念这一天。</p>
<p>For those who do not know, pi is a mathematical constant, a value that never changes. It expresses the ratio of a circle's circumference (the distance around the circle) to its diameter (the distance across the circle, passing through its center.)<br/>
对于那些不知道圆周率日的人来说，圆周率是一个数学常数，也就是一个定值。它表示圆的周长与其直径的比率。</p>
<p>The approximate value of this mathematical constant is 3.1415926535. But those are just the first 10 digits of pi. The numbers go on infinitely, or forever.<br/>
这个数学常数的近似值是3.1415926535。但这只是圆周率的前10位数字。这些数字是无限的，或者说是永无止境的。</p>
<p>Pi can calculate the circumference of a circle by measuring the diameter and multiplying that by the 3.14-plus number. The formula has been used in physics, astronomy, engineering and other fields, dating back thousands of years.<br/>
圆周率可用于计算圆的周长，即测量直径的长度并乘以3.14这个数字。该公式已被应用于物理学、天文学、工程学和其他领域，可以追溯到数千年前。</p>
<p>Long before computers, scientists such as Isaac Newton spent many hours calculating decimal places by hand. But today, researchers use computers to come up with trillions of digits for pi. But there is no end.<br/>
早在计算机出现之前，像牛顿这样的科学家就花了很多时间手工计算小数位数。但今天，研究人员使用计算机计算出数万亿位数的圆周率。但是没有尽头。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are some practical uses for Pi?<br/>
圆周率的一些实际用途</span></p>
<p>There are many uses for pi.<br/>
圆周率有很多用途。</p>
<p>The number helps calculate the size of paper rolls used in printers. And it helps decide the necessary size of a container that serves heating and air conditioning systems in buildings of different sizes.<br/>
这个数字有助于计算打印机中使用的纸卷的大小。它有助于确定不同尺寸建筑中供暖和空调系统所需容器的必要尺寸。</p>
<p>Scientists use the number to point an antenna toward a satellite and calculate the orbits and positions of planets and other space bodies.<br/>
科学家们用这个数字将天线指向卫星，以及计算行星和其他空间物体的轨道和位置。</p>
<p>Scientists with the American space agency NASA use pi to calculate when parachutes should open as a vehicle splashes down on Earth or lands on Mars.<br/>
美国宇航局的科学家使用圆周率来计算当飞行器溅落地球或降落火星时降落伞何时打开。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pi Day<br/>
圓周率日</span></p>
<p>In 1706, British mathematician William Jones began using the Greek letter pi for the number 3.14… It is the first Greek letter in the words "periphery" and "perimeter." Both words have similar meanings as circumference.<br/>
1706年，英国数学家威廉·琼斯开始使用希腊字母π来表示3.14……这是单词periphery和perimeter中的第一个希腊字母。这两个词与周长的含义相似。</p>
<p>Pi Day itself dates back to the year 1988. That was when physicist Larry Shaw began celebrations at the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco, California.<br/>
圆周率日自身可以追溯到1988年。当时物理学家拉里·肖在加州旧金山探索馆这家科学博物馆开始庆祝活动。</p>
<p>The so-called holiday did not gain national recognition until more than 20 years later. In 2009, the U.S. Congress declared every March 14 to be Pi Day as a way to bring more interest in math and science.<br/>
直到20多年后，这个所谓的节日才得到全美国的认可。2009年，美国国会宣布每年3月14日为圆周率日，以提高人们对数学和科学的兴趣。</p>
<p>The San Francisco museum that started the holiday organizes events, including a walk around a circular sign, called the Pi Shrine, 3.14 times. Of course, there is also plenty of pie to eat.<br/>
开创这一节日的旧金山博物馆会组织活动，包括绕着一个名为Pi Shrine的圆形标志散步3.14次。当然，这里也有很多馅饼可以吃。</p>
<p>Many Pi Day events take place at colleges in the United States. For example, Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in Florida holds the "Mental Math Bingo" game with free pizza pies.<br/>
许多圆周率日活动都在美国的大学举行。例如，佛罗里达州的新东南大学举办了免费披萨派的“心理数学宾果”游戏。</p>
<p>Jason Gershman oversees NSU's math department. He said, "Every year, Pi Day provides us with a way to celebrate math, have some fun and recognize how important math is in all our lives."<br/>
贾森·戈希曼负责新东南大学的数学部门。他说：“每年的圆周率日都为我们提供了一种庆祝数学、享受乐趣并认识到数学在我们生活中的重要性的途径。”</p>
<p>NASA has its yearly "Pi Day Challenge" online. The space agency offers games and puzzles, such as calculating the orbit of an asteroid or the distance a moon rover would need to travel each day to study a certain lunar area.<br/>
美国宇航局每年都会在网上举办“圆周率日挑战赛”。美国宇航局提供游戏和谜题，例如计算小行星的轨道或月球车研究某个月球区域每天需要行驶的距离。</p>
<p>If you still wonder why Pi Day is such an important day for math lovers, here are two more reasons: Albert Einstein, possibly the world's best-known scientist, was born on March 14, 1879. And famed physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76.<br/>
如果你仍然想知道为什么圆周率日对数学爱好者来说如此重要，还有两个原因：阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦这位可能是世界上最著名的科学家，出生于1879年3月14日。著名物理学家斯蒂芬·霍金于2018年3月14日去世，享年76岁。</p>
<p>Although pi is not a perfect number. Hawking once had this to say: "One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn't exist. Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist."<br/>
虽然圆周率不是一个完美的数字。霍金曾说过：“宇宙的一条基本规则是，没有什么是完美的。完美根本不存在。没有这些不完美，你和我就可能都不存在。”</p>
<p>And Happy Pi Day!<br/>
祝大家圆周率日快乐！</p>

            <title>Europe Approves AI Law  (2024/3/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202403/europe-approves-ai-law.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">14 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>European Union lawmakers gave final approval to the 27-nation group's artificial intelligence law Wednesday. The rules are expected to take effect later this year.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the European Parliament voted in favor of the Artificial Intelligence Act, five years after <strong>regulations</strong> were first proposed.</p>
<p>Major technology companies have generally supported the idea. But they want to make sure new AI requirements work in their favor. OpenAI chief Sam Altman suggested the maker of ChatGPT might pull out of Europe if it cannot <strong>comply</strong> with the AI Act. He later said his company had no plans to leave.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This illustration photograph taken on October 30, 2023, in Mulhouse, eastern France, shows figurines next to a screen displaying a logo of OpenAI. (Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9a9cc7d3-578f-4cd5-af6d-4c13bda4bc9c_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This illustration photograph taken on October 30, 2023, in Mulhouse, eastern France, shows figurines next to a screen displaying a logo of OpenAI. (Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON / AFP)</span></div>
<p>Here are some details about Europe's new AI rules:</p>
<p><strong>How does the AI Act work?</strong></p>
<p>Like many EU regulations, the AI Act started as <strong>consumer</strong> safety legislation. The EU took a "risk-based approach" to products or services that use artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>If an AI application is risky, then more rules cover it. Most AI systems are expected to be low risk, like content recommendation systems or <strong>filters </strong>that block spam, or unwanted email. Companies can choose to follow voluntary requirements and <strong>codes of conduct</strong>.</p>
<p>High-risk uses of AI include tools used in medical devices or important <strong>infrastructure</strong> like water or electrical networks. Those face additional requirements like using what the legislation calls high-quality data and providing clear information to users.</p>
<p>Some AI uses are banned because they are considered to present an unacceptable risk. Those include things like social scoring systems that are meant to govern how people behave. Some sorts of predictive policing and emotion recognition systems also are reportedly banned in schools and workplaces.</p>
<p>Other banned uses include ones that police use to <strong>scan</strong> faces in public places using AI-powered remote "<strong>biometric</strong> identification" systems. There is an exception for use in serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>What about generative AI?</strong></p>
<p>The law's early versions centered on AI systems that carry out limited tasks, like reviewing employment information and job applications. But general AI models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, forced EU officials to add rules for generative AI models. AI chatbot systems that can produce lifelike responses, images and more are examples of generative AI models.</p>
<p>Developers of general purpose AI models will have to provide detailed descriptions of the writings, pictures, video and other data on the internet that was used to train the systems. They must also follow EU copyright law.</p>
<p>AI-generated pictures, video or audio of existing people, places or events must be labeled as <strong>artificially</strong> produced. These sorts of media are known as "deepfakes" because they appear to show real people doing or saying things that are not real.</p>
<p>There are reportedly extra rules for the biggest and most powerful AI models that carry "systemic risks." Those include OpenAI's GPT4 and Google's Gemini.</p>
<p><strong>What do Europe's rules mean?</strong></p>
<p>The EU first suggested AI regulations in 2019. Europe was quick to propose rules for the new and developing industry.</p>
<p>In the U.S., President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI in October. The U.S. Congress is likely to propose legislation. Lawmakers in at least seven U.S. states are working on their own AI legislation. And international agreements are possible too.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed his Global AI Governance Initiative for fair and safe use of AI. Other major countries, including Brazil and Japan, are developing rules, as well as the United Nations and Group of Seven industrialized nations.</p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>The AI Act is expected to officially become law by May or June, after approval from EU member countries. Rules will start taking effect slowly. Countries will be required to ban unapproved AI systems six months after the law takes effect.</p>
<p>Rules for general purpose AI systems like chatbots will start going into effect in one year. By the middle of 2026, the complete set of regulations, including requirements for high-risk systems, will be in effect.</p>
<p>Each EU country will set up their own AI enforcement agency. Citizens can make a <strong>complaint</strong> if they think they have been the victim of a violation of the rules. And the EU will create an AI Office that will oversee the law for general purpose AI systems.</p>
<p>Violations of the AI Act could be punished with a fine of up to $38 million, or seven percent of a company's worldwide <strong>revenue</strong>.</p>

<p>In the eastern state of Virginia, employees of the Richmond Wildlife Center are doing their best to act like mother <strong>foxes</strong>. They started feeding and caring for a baby fox, called a kit, when the young animal became separated from its mother.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that a video recently appeared on the center's page on the social media service Facebook. In the video, Executive Director Melissa Stanley is shown wearing a red fox <strong>mask</strong> and equipment like rubber gloves. She feeds the young fox in the video. The kit sits on top of a <strong>stuffed</strong> <strong>animal</strong> that looks like a fox. It is supposed to look like her mother, Stanley said.</p>
<p>The Facebook post explained why employees were wearing the fox mask to feed the baby animal. It also said workers are avoiding making human sounds and are preventing the kit from seeing its human caregivers. The post said the <strong>orphan</strong> should not become too close to humans while it is being raised by them. The measures make it more likely that the kit could be returned to the wild.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this image taken from a video provided by the Richmond Wildlife Center, executive director and founder Melissa Stanley wears a fox mask as she feeds an orphaned red fox kit, March 10, 2024, in Richmond, Va.

<p>Stanley said a man brought the kit to the center on February 29. She said he found the animal on the street while walking his dog in Richmond.</p>
<p>Thinking she was a baby cat, the man turned her over to the Richmond Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Richmond SPCA). The Richmond SPCA is a nonprofit organization that takes in cats and dogs without owners and finds them homes.</p>
<p>Wildlife center employees tried to find the kit's mother and their home, or den. They found the den, but they were told by officials that the foxes had been trapped and removed. Stanley said she thinks the fox kit either fell out of a trap or fell off the back of the trapper's truck.</p>
<p>Employees at the wildlife center have been taking turns feeding the kit every two to four hours. They all wear the fox mask while feeding her.</p>
<p>In addition to the large stuffed animal meant to look like the kit's mother, employees also put a smaller stuffed red fox in her space. She <strong>cuddles</strong> <strong>up</strong> to the smaller stuffed animal at the end of the video.</p>
<p>Stanley said, "The goal is to release the animals back into the wild." She added that the goal is not to just increase their chances of survival, but to raise them to <strong>recognize </strong>other animals of their kind. Another goal she said was that the animals should reproduce.</p>
<p>The center looked for other red fox kits of the same age and weight at other centers. Employees found three other kits in a center in northern Virginia.</p>
<p>The fox kit will be sent to the Animal Education and Rescue Organization in Virginia. That group plans to release the kits back into the wild together.</p>

<p>Consider a time when you sat down to share a dish with family or friends. What was the dish? Is the dish special in your country or area?</p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will explore how to talk about foods. We will learn about the structures and words commonly used to talk about popular dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-c19d-08dc437fc2ab_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar </span></div>
<p>Let's start with a comparison between cooking and grammar. Just as we have common <strong>ingredients</strong> when we cook – oil, salt, vegetables, meats, and so on – we also have common ingredients for sentences about food. These language ingredients include nouns, adjectives, and special kinds of <strong>phrases</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as cooking is about using food ingredients in special ways, food discussions are about using language ingredients in special ways.</p>
<p><strong>Nouns </strong></p>
<p>Our first ingredient is the noun. Nouns give us the name of a dish, or any food prepared in a special way. Nouns also give us names for all the spices and other materials that go into the dish.</p>
<p>But nouns alone cannot make a rich, complete sentence.</p>
<p>We need something else to add color, smells, and taste.</p>
<p>That is how we arrive at adjectives.</p>
<p>Adjectives are central to discussions about food. When we talk about any kind of dish, we describe it in terms of taste, color, smell, temperature, and so on.</p>
<p>In other words, adjectives are like spices that bring flavor to plain nouns.</p>
<p>There are many adjectives we use to describe dishes, but some common ones include: rich, spicy, sweet and fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Phrases </strong></p>
<p>So, we have nouns and adjectives. But we have one missing element. We need to express how ingredients go together to make up a dish.</p>
<p>One phrasal verb is especially useful in this regard: consist of.</p>
<p>We have the verb "consist" and the short word "of."</p>
<p>"Consist of" means to be formed, or made, of exact things.</p>
<p>So, you might say that pizza consists of flour, cheese, sauce, and vegetables.</p>
<p>Or you might say that kebab consists of meat and spices.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many other phrasal verbs you can use to describe the act of cooking. We have explored some of them in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/cooking-with-phrasal-verbs/4428624.html" target="_blank">previous Everyday Grammar lessons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Example </strong></p>
<p>So far, we have covered a lot of territory - nouns, adjectives, and one phrasal verb. How might we use these ingredients?</p>
<p>Here is one possible example for how to describe any national dish:</p>
<p><em>[Noun] is the national dish of [noun]. It is a [adjective] dish that [phrasal verb] [noun], [noun], and [noun]. </em></p>
<p>How might we fill in the noun, adjective, and phrasal verb spots?</p>
<p>Let's use a traditionally popular dish in the United States as our example – apple pie. You may have heard the expression "As American as apple pie."</p>
<p>So, what could we say about apple pie if we used our example structure? Here is one possibility:</p>
<p><em>Apple pie is the national dish of the United States. It is a sweet dish that consists of apples, sugar, flour, and spices.</em></p>
<p>Of course, one could go on to add more details. You could say that apple pie also often includes a small amount of lemon juice or that apple pie is often served with ice cream on top.</p>
<p><strong>Call to action </strong></p>
<p>You have learned about one possible way to describe a popular American dish. Now we would like to hear from you. Can you write to us about a traditional dish in your country? Try to use the sentence structures that you have just learned about, but feel free to include more details.</p>
<p>Send us your piece of writing in an email to <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com" target="_blank">learningenglish@voanews.com</a></p>
<p>In a future lesson, we will provide feedback on the writing that we receive.</p>

<p>An American <strong>insurance</strong> industry group has given most driver assistance systems "poor" ratings after a series of safety tests.</p>
<p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) carried out the tests. The group released a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/first-partial-driving-automation-safeguard-ratings-show-industry-has-work-to-do">report</a> this week describing its findings.</p>
<p>The tests involved 14 different driver assistance tools. Such tools offer partial driving <strong>automation</strong> as a way to improve safety and reduce accidents. The systems are equipped to assist drivers with things like staying inside road lines and automatically slowing or stopping the car when possible dangers are identified.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A Tesla Model 3 vehicle drives on autopilot along the 405 highway in Westminster, California, U.S., March 16, 2022.

<p>The IIHS is a nonprofit organization financed by America's insurance industry. The group carries out numerous crash tests each year as it seeks to persuade automakers to design safer vehicles. Automakers follow safety ratings issued by the group and often make changes to products based on them.</p>
<p>The IIHS noted there is a lack of effective tools to <strong>monitor</strong> drivers and provide warnings when they need to pay better attention or take immediate corrective action.</p>
<p>David Harkey is president of the IIHS. He told the Associated Press his group aims to set guidelines for manufacturers to make up for a lack of <strong>regulation</strong> over the systems by the U.S. National Highway Safety Administration.</p>
<p>Harkey noted that most current driver assist systems do not have effective measures "to prevent misuse and keep drivers from losing <strong>focus</strong> on what's happening on the road."</p>
<p>All automakers advise drivers using assistance tools not to fully depend on vehicle technologies to keep them safe. The companies say the tools are meant to improve, or enhance, overall safety, rather than take over certain driving duties.</p>
<p>The IIHS said it tested 14 different driver assist systems. Of those, 11 received an overall rating of "poor." Two other systems were rated "<strong>marginal</strong>," while one was considered "acceptable." Harkey said the 14 systems are among the highest quality technologies currently on the market.</p>
<p>The driver assist system used in the Lexus LS model earned the acceptable rating. The marginal declarations were given to systems in General Motors' GMC Sierra and Nissan's Ariya electric vehicle. Other systems from Nissan, Tesla, BMW, Ford, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo received ratings of "poor."</p>
<p>Harkey said the high-level of technology <strong>sophistication</strong> in today's driver assist systems provides a lot more automation possibilities. But these tools can cause drivers not to pay attention for longer periods, presenting new, dangerous risks. "That's why the focus is on how do we make sure that the driver remains focused on the driving...," he added.</p>
<p>The IIHS has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/study-many-drivers-treat-driving-assist-tools-as-fully-self-driving/6789001.html">warned</a> that manufacturers advertise their vehicles in a way that gives drivers the false idea that they are fully automated, or autonomous. "The one thing we do not want is for drivers to <strong>misinterpret</strong> what these things can or cannot do," Harkey said.</p>
<p>The IIHS is calling for automakers to build additional tools into their systems. These would be designed to observe whether or not a driver's eyes are directed at the road and whether their hands are on the wheel or ready to immediately take control.</p>
<p>The institute suggested the systems should have built-in tools that send warnings to drivers within 10 seconds if their eyes and hands are not in the right positions. At 20 seconds, the IIHS said the system should add another warning or start an automatic emergency process to slow down the vehicle.</p>
<p>Toyota, which makes Lexus vehicles, said it considers IIHS reports when it creates safety guidelines, while General Motors called the ratings important. Nissan said it will work with the institute on proposed changes.</p>
<p>Mercedes said it takes the findings seriously, while Hyundai Genesis said it was quickly improving its system, including plans to put a camera inside vehicles.</p>
<p>BMW said while it respects IIHS's efforts, it differs on the use of technology to monitor drivers inside the vehicle. Ford said its driver assist system monitors drivers and sends repeated warnings. While Ford said it disagrees with the institute's findings, it will consider the suggestions in future development.</p>

            <title>Stone Tools Might Be Earliest Evidence of Human Ancestors in Europe  (2024/3/14)</title>

<p>Researchers say they have identified stone tools that might represent the oldest-known evidence of humans in Europe.</p>
<p>The recent research suggests that the human ancestors started settling Europe 1.4 million years ago. That is hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously thought.</p>
<p>The stone tools were first discovered in the 1970s near the town of Korolevo, close to Ukraine's borders with Hungary and Romania. But the tools' age had remained unclear.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A view of the Korolevo quarry in western Ukraine, surrounded by archaeological sites, August 12, 2021. (Roman Garba/Handout via REUTERS)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fa7c2f72-937d-4a87-afc3-ba7a5c55e18a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A view of the Korolevo quarry in western Ukraine, surrounded by archaeological sites, August 12, 2021. (Roman Garba/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The place of the find is important for understanding how humans first spread into Europe. They moved into the area during warm periods, called interglacial periods. Those were times, in between Ice Ages, when huge amounts of ice covered Europe.</p>
<p>The scientists used a method for estimating the age that identifies the effects of <strong>cosmic rays </strong>on some kinds of minerals. The new method placed the age of the <strong>sediment</strong> layer containing the stone tools at around 1.4 million years.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that the maker of the tools was likely a human ancestor called Homo erectus. That early human <strong>species</strong> appeared around 2 million years ago and spread across Africa, Asia and Europe before disappearing perhaps 110,000 years ago.</p>
<p>"No bones were found at Korolevo, only stone tools. But the age suggests that Homo erectus was the only possible human species at the time. We know very little about our earliest ancestors. They used stone tools for <strong>butchery</strong> and probably used fire," said Roman Garba of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Garba was the lead writer of the research published in Nature.</p>
<p>Homo erectus was the first member of our evolutionary <strong>lineage</strong>. Homo erectus had body <strong>proportions</strong> like our species, Homo sapiens, though with a smaller brain.</p>
<p>The tools, made of volcanic rock, were made in a way that is called Oldowan. While simple, they represent the beginning of human technology.</p>
<p>Until now, the oldest-known evidence of humans in Europe was from about 1.2 million years ago from a place called Atapuerca in Spain.</p>
<p>The Korolevo findings suggest how the first humans might have moved into Europe. Homo erectus<strong> fossils</strong> from 1.8 million years ago are known from a place in the Caucasus Mountains in Georgia called Dmanisi. Garba said the evidence from Korolevo and Dmanisi suggests Homo erectus entered Europe from the east or southeast, moving along the Danube River.</p>
<p>It has been difficult to identify the age of places like Korolevo. The study dated the tools, left by their makers on a riverbed, by estimating when the layer holding the objects was buried under sediment.</p>
<p>Mads Knudsen of Aarhus University in Denmark described how scientists were able to date the prehistoric tools.</p>
<p>He said cosmic rays from outer space are always passing through the Earth's atmosphere. When they do, they create particles that are smaller than atoms, such as neutrons and muons. These particles are so small that they pass through all sorts of materials.</p>
<p>These particles react with minerals in rocks to produce radioactive nuclides, a class of atoms. The sediment was dated based on the <strong>ratio </strong>of two nuclides. This is possible because the two nuclides break down at different rates, through the process of radioactive decay.</p>
<p>Europe was later colonized by other human ancestor species including Homo heidelbergensis and Neanderthals. Scientists say Homo sapiens evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago. They arrived in large numbers in Europe around 40,000 to 45,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers suspect evidence of human occupation in Europe that is even older than Korolevo will be found.</p>
<p>"The question is not 'if' but 'when' we will find a site of similar or older age somewhere else in Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria or Serbia," Garba said.</p>

<p>In her small home in the capital of Greece, Athens, 93-year-old Ioanna Matsouka has <strong>knit</strong> thousands of brightly colored <strong>scarves </strong>for children in need from Greece to Bosnia to Ukraine. She has no plans to stop just yet.</p>
<p>"Until I die, I will be knitting," Matsouka told Reuters. Her knitting tools called needles made noises through her expert fingers, her nails painted red. "It brings me <strong>joy</strong> to share them," she said.</p>
<p>Since she took up knitting in the 1990s, Matsouka has easily made over 3,000 scarves, her daughters estimate.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ioanna Matsouka, 93, knits scarves in her house in Athens, Greece, March 6, 2024.

<p>By the door to her home, bags filled with her latest creations await their new owners. A knitted <strong>blanket</strong> is thrown over a large chair where she spends her days.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the scarves were gifted to friends. As the number of scarves grew, they were donated to children's homes across Greece. Then, through people she knew, they reached children in Bosnia and Ukraine. The latest 70 scarves went to a refugee camp near Athens this winter, via the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.</p>
<p>"The fact that we give them away gives her strength," said her daughter Angeliki.</p>
<p>She recounted simple artwork and mail her mother received over the years: "Thank you, be well, keep going. You gave joy to children; you gave joy to people... That's her only <strong>reward</strong>: a letter, a few words."</p>
<p>Matsouka knits one scarf a day now. Her eyesight suffers and she sometimes has severe facial pain, a condition known as trigeminal neuralgia.</p>
<p>Angeliki says her mother is an example of strength and hope.</p>
<p>Matsouka wakes up every morning, drinks a glass of milk, puts on her jewelry and gets to work. She takes a break for lunch and a short sleep, then knits into the night.</p>
<p>She may have even found the secret to a long life in it, she says. "It's the happiness I get from giving," she said, sitting beside a big blue bag filled with the knitting materials.</p>

<p>"A good book is easy to find." That is the message on a sign at Hernando Guanlao's home in the Makati area of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Guanlao has turned his home into a free public library. Visitors can borrow the books inside for free.</p>
<p>Guanlao says he hopes his library will<strong> inspire</strong> people to read, especially the young. The 72-year-old told reporters that his library includes books that all students can enjoy – from young children in Kindergarten to older students in grade 12.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Hernando Guanlao, 72, sits in front of his home library in Makati, a metro area of Manila, Philippines, Feb. 7, 2024.

(REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez)</span></div>
<p>Guanlao says his library has books for readers of all interests. He spoke to reporters at his home, which is filled with thousands of available books.</p>
<p>He calls his library Reading Club 2000. It contains many different kinds of books, or genres.</p>
<p>Genre is a group of artistic, musical, or literary works that share a particular style, form, or content. Some genres in <strong>literature</strong> are poetry, non-fiction (or real stories), and fiction (or imaginary stories). Then there are "sub-genres" such as cookbooks, science fiction, and mystery, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Guanlao added, "There are also spiritual books for those who are looking for religious knowledge, hardbound and softbound books, autobiographies, and many different<strong> </strong>genres that one can enjoy, all for free."</p>
<p>He started his library more than 20 years ago when he set 50 books on the walkway in front of his home. Guanlao's collection has grown greatly over the years -- thanks to a continuous supply of books from donors.</p>
<p>Speaking of donors, he said, "They just leave boxes of books outside my house." He has also started donating books himself. He sends reading materials to public schools in far-away communities.</p>
<p>Guanlao's efforts come at a time when reading ability among students in the Philippines remains low. The Program for International Student Assessment reports that reading scores in the Philippines are among the lowest in the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development runs that program.</p>
<p>Students in the Philippines are also facing learning delays in math and science.</p>
<p>Guanlao is firm about his goals: "My <strong>mission</strong> is to give away used and donated books to others at no cost," he said, "and to <strong>promote</strong> education through literature."</p>

            <title>US Agency Warns: Mass Coral Bleaching Expected in Near Future  (2024/3/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202403/us-agency-warns-mass-coral-bleaching-expected-in-near-future.mp3"/>

<span class="datetime">12 March 2024</span><br/>
<p>The American agency that follows the risk of coral bleaching around the world says "the worst bleaching event in the history of the planet may come soon."</p>
<p>Those are the words of Derek Manzello, head of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch.</p>
<p>NOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A photo of threatened coral off the southern edge of Florida. (REUTERS/Maria Alejandra Cardona/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/ad1c2456-02cd-438d-82bb-045e728f364a_cx0_cy14_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A photo of threatened coral off the southern edge of Florida. (REUTERS/Maria Alejandra Cardona/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>Manzello said the "<strong>entirety</strong>" of the Southern Hemisphere is "probably going to bleach this year." The Southern Hemisphere is currently in summer and suffering from record-breaking water temperatures.</p>
<p>Experts say climate change and the El Nino weather pattern are to blame for the warmer water.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive organisms</strong></p>
<p>Corals are small marine organisms that attach to mineral <strong>deposits</strong> in the ocean. Collections of the animals form ocean structures that support many kinds of sea life.</p>
<p>Bleaching is the term used by experts who see the once colorful coral turn white when water temperatures rise. It is a sign the animals are dying.</p>
<p>If corals die or go <strong>dormant</strong>, they can hurt fishing and tourism industries.</p>
<p>The last large coral bleaching event around the world took place from 2014 to 2017. At the time, the Great Barrier Reef off Australia lost nearly one-third of its coral. Overall, the world lost 15 percent of its coral.</p>
<p>Corals get their color from small plants called algae that live inside them. The high temperatures stress the coral and cause them to <strong>expel</strong> the algae. When that happens, the corals lose their color. The algae help the coral stay healthy and without it, the corals face increasing risk of disease.</p>
<p>Observers are concerned that 2024's bleaching will be even worse than the last time. Scientists reported the worst coral bleaching on record in the Caribbean late last year.</p>
<p>Manzello said there is coral bleaching "all over the place" in the Southern Hemisphere. He said all of the Great Barrier Reef is bleaching as are reefs in the territory of American Samoa.</p>
<p>The El Nino weather pattern always brings warmer ocean temperatures. However, the world just experienced one of the warmest 12-month periods on record. In 2023, temperatures were 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than during pre-industrial times. Scientists say a longer period of high temperatures could cause the deaths of 90 percent of the world's coral.</p>
<p>Manzello noted that scientists must look at coral in all three major oceans – Atlantic, Pacific and Indian – to call a bleaching event "global."</p>
<p>Scientists use sea surface temperature data and examine satellite imagery of reefs to measure for bleaching. Based on studies so far, Manzello said the world is "already there."</p>
<p>A similar study of Indian Ocean coral is continuing.</p>
<p>Joanne Manning is a spokesperson for the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Manning said the organization has documented extensive bleaching in the Keppels area and Capricorn-Bunker groups. She said the group's research continues.</p>

            <title>Study Looks at How 15-year-olds Learn English  (2024/3/13)</title>

<p>Today's English students have a lot of <strong>exposure</strong> to the language outside of the classroom. By using the internet, social media, and other <strong>digital</strong> technologies, they can watch videos, hear music, and play video games in English.</p>
<p>But teachers are not so sure that digital exposure results in better English-speaking abilities. That is the finding of a new study on how teenagers learn English. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group that studies economic activities in large economies, supported the study.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/a3fcacd5-en/1/3/8/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/a3fcacd5-en&amp;_csp_=699fa32b3d47245b9d0bc15535a1d6cf&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book">study</a> is called "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/how-15-year-olds-learn-english_f30ed0a4-en">How 15-Year-Olds Learn English.</a>" It provides case studies of teaching teenagers English from five countries: Finland, Greece, Israel, the Netherlands and Portugal. The researchers gathered information by visiting schools and observing English lessons in each country. They also <strong>interviewed</strong> teachers, students and school administrators.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - ESL (English-as-a-second-language) teacher Xavier Chavez, standing, teaches a summer history class at Benson High School in Portland, Ore.,Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2008. (AP Photo/Don Ryan)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/D453CE0D-CF25-4D78-912C-54154923EB59_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - ESL (English-as-a-second-language) teacher Xavier Chavez, standing, teaches a summer history class at Benson High School in Portland, Ore.,Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2008.

<p>The study findings will be used to support the OECD's 2025 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), said Catalina Covacevich. She was one of the study's main researchers. PISA studies the school systems of about 90 countries by measuring the performance of 15-year-olds in reading, writing and math. In 2025, PISA will aim to measure 22 of those countries' English language skills for the first time.</p>
<p>"It's an <strong>obvious</strong> statement that English <strong>transcends</strong> classroom walls," Christa Rawkins told VOA. She was another one of the researchers for the study.</p>
<p>Teens spoke "about the ways they used English with people on those sorts of social networking sites and other media. But it was rarer that they were talking about sitting down to learn English via those <strong>platforms</strong>."</p>
<p>Some students in Greece said it is easier to search for English-language information on the internet because more of it is available. In the Netherlands, 15-year-olds described watching English YouTube videos. In a written opinion study, half of students in the Netherlands reported always using English when using digital tools.</p>
<p>Teachers however are unsure whether digital tools are improving students' English knowledge. While teachers said using English platforms might increase students' motivation to learn and help them get used to the language, the platforms "are not necessarily teaching them English," Rawkins said.</p>
<p>One teacher in Finland, for example, said students might get the false idea that they do not need to study English because of how often they use English outside of school.</p>
<p>"They think they know it better than I do because they use it in computer games and it's present in their lives all the time," the teacher said. "They think they don't have to listen to me in English classes, I feel that is a <strong>challenge</strong>.</p>
<p>Rawkins said there is a "slight disconnect" between the kind of English students are learning outside of school "and the kind of English they're being asked to learn and study in classrooms." Students might feel that "studying English at school is just about studying <strong>grammar</strong> whereas outside (of) school they can communicate and interact in the language," the report said.</p>
<p>A large part of OECD's work with PISA, the researchers said, is examining <strong>inequities</strong> in education. Rawkins said there can be large inequities that arise from the kinds of out-of-school exposure kids get to English. Kids from wealthy families are able to travel to English-speaking countries or attend summer camps where they can speak English to international friends, for example. Some students can pay for private lessons.</p>
<p>"Kids living in cities were more likely to be using English out and about in their daily lives compared to their counterparts in more rural areas," Rawkins added.</p>
<p>There has been a big change in how students are exposed to English outside of school. But within the classroom, things "hadn't really changed." The report noted how digital technologies are used within the classroom, but traditional teaching methods, like textbooks, were still used in every school observed.</p>
<p>Teachers in all five countries said their students struggled the most with writing and speaking English rather than in reading and listening. Researchers noted that students might feel a lack of self-confidence when it comes to speaking. They might also be less likely to speak and write English outside of school.</p>
<p>"Outside school they're doing a lot of reading and listening to English because that's what the majority of their exposure is, particularly when it comes to digital technologies," Rawkins said. "They're not doing so much speaking or writing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced early Tuesday that he would resign once a transitional council is created. The move followed international pressure to save the country from violent criminal groups.<br/>
海地总理阿里埃尔·亨利周二早些时候宣布，一旦过渡委员会成立，他将辞职。此举是在国际社会施加压力，要求将该国从暴力犯罪集团手中拯救出来之后做出的。</p>
<p>Henry announced the decision hours after meeting with leaders of neighboring Caribbean nations and American Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The group met in Jamaica to discuss a solution to Haiti's crisis. They agreed to a joint proposal to establish a transitional council.<br/>
亨利在与加勒比邻国领导人和美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯会晤数小时后宣布了这一决定。该群体在牙买加举行会议，讨论海地危机的解决方案。他们同意了建立一个过渡委员会的联合提议。</p>
<p>"The government that I'm running cannot remain insensitive in front of this situation. There is no sacrifice that is too big for our country," Henry said in a videotaped statement. "The government I'm running will remove itself immediately after the installation of the council."<br/>
亨利在一份录像声明中说：“我所领导的政府在这种情况面前不能麻木不仁。对我们的国家来说，没有太大的牺牲。我所领导的政府将在委员会成立后立即解散。”</p>
<p>After the announcement, Haitians celebrated in the streets in the capital Port-au-Prince, dancing and playing music, Reuters news agency reported, based on videos posted on Haitian social media.<br/>
据路透社报道，根据海地社交媒体上发布的视频，该消息宣布后，海地人在首都太子港街头载歌载舞地庆祝。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Haiti under Henry<br/>
亨利统治下的海地</span></p>
<p>Henry took power in 2021 following the murder of President Jovenel Moise. Under his administration, armed criminal groups, called gangs, grew in wealth and power.<br/>
亨利于2021年在总统约维尼尔·莫伊兹被谋杀后掌权。在他的领导下，被称为帮派的武装犯罪集团的财富和权力不断增加。</p>
<p>In late February, Henry traveled to Kenya to secure its support for a United Nations-backed security mission to help Haitian police. However, the violence greatly increased in his absence. It led to the closing of the country's main international airports.<br/>
2月下旬，亨利前往肯尼亚，以确保其对联合国支持的一项帮助海地警察的安全任务的支持。然而，在他缺席期间，暴力事件大大增加。这导致该国主要国际机场关闭。</p>
<p>Armed gangs have burned police stations and raided two of the country's biggest prisons. The raids resulted in the release of more than 4,000 prisoners.<br/>
武装团伙烧毁了警察局，并突袭了该国两所最大的监狱。突袭行动导致了4000多名囚犯被释放。</p>
<p>Many Haitians have been killed and more than 15,000 are homeless after fleeing neighborhoods raided by gangs. Stores are running out of goods. Food and water are lacking. The main port in the capital city is closed, keeping supplies away.<br/>
许多海地人被杀害，还有15000多人在逃离被帮派袭击的社区后无家可归。商店里的商品眼看要销售一空。食物和水缺乏。首都的主要港口已经关闭，物资供应中断。</p>
<p>Henry arrived in Puerto Rico a week ago, after being barred from landing in the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor. Dominican officials also closed the airspace to flights to and from Haiti.<br/>
亨利一周前抵达波多黎各，此前他被禁止在海地的邻国多米尼加共和国降落。多米尼加官员还对进出海地的航班关闭了领空。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">International force<br/>
国际力量</span></p>
<p>On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new council would be responsible for meeting the "immediate needs" of Haitians. They include the deployment of an international security mission to help police fight armed criminals.<br/>
周一，美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯表示，新的委员会将负责满足海地人的“迫切需求”。其中包括部署一个国际安全特派团，帮助警察打击武装罪犯。</p>
<p>The U.S. would also provide an additional $100 million to this mission and $33 million in humanitarian aid, bringing the U.S. total promise to $300 million.<br/>
美国还将向这项任务额外提供1亿美元和3300万美元的人道主义援助，使美国的承诺总额达到3亿美元。</p>
<p>A U.N. spokesperson said that, as of Monday, less than $11 million had been provided to the U.N.'s account for the mission. No financial contributions have arrived since Haiti declared its state of emergency on March 3.<br/>
联合国发言人表示，截至周一，联合国负责该任务的账户收到的援助不足1100万美元。自3月3日海地宣布进入紧急状态以来，没有收到任何财政捐款。</p>
<p>As Haiti prepares for new leadership, some experts question the role of armed gangs that control 80 percent of Port-au-Prince.<br/>
在海地筹备新领导层之际，一些专家质疑控制太子港80%地区的武装组织的作用。</p>
<p>"Even if you have a different kind of government, the reality is that you need to talk to the gangs," said Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia.<br/>
弗吉尼亚大学海地政治专家罗伯特·法顿说：“即使有了一个不同类型的政府，现实是你需要与帮派对话。”</p>
<p>Fatton said officials will still have to deal with the armed groups and try to convince them to give up their weapons, "but what would be their concessions?"<br/>
法顿说，官员们仍将不得不与武装组织打交道，并试图说服他们放弃武器，“但他们会做出什么让步？”</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates over 362,000 people have been internally displaced in Haiti. The organization says thousands have been killed in the conflict overall, with widespread reports of rape, torture and kidnappings since 2021.<br/>
联合国估计，海地境内有362000多人流离失所。该机构表示，自2021年以来，已有数千人在冲突中丧生，同时有大量关于强奸、酷刑和绑架的报道。</p>

<p>Shevchenko Garden, located in the heart of Kharkiv, is a significant public park named after the renowned Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko. Established in 1907, the garden has a rich history, beginning as a botanical garden showcasing Ukraine's diverse flora. Over the years, it has transformed into a beloved recreational space, hosting various events, art exhibitions and concerts, making it an integral part of Kharkiv's cultural scene.</p>
<p>In addition to its cultural significance, Shevchenko Garden plays a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. The park is home to a wide range of plant and animal species, some of which are rare and endangered. You can freely visit the modern and renovated Kharkiv Zoo, which is located in Shevchenko Garden. Efforts are made by the park's caretakers to maintain the ecological balance, ensuring the conservation of these species for future generations.</p>
<p>The garden's allure is not only in its natural beauty but also in its ability to bring people together. Families gather for picnics, children enjoy outdoor activities, and artists find inspiration amidst the serene surroundings. There are small, cozy cafes and ice cream stalls, restaurants, and coffee shops, a concert hall, and an opera house. Lots of people spend their time in this peaceful and tranquil place. Shevchenko Garden serves as a symbol of unity in Kharkiv, welcoming people from diverse backgrounds and fostering a sense of community. This is very important nowadays during the war; people in Kharkiv are courageous and resilient. They adore the city and make it better every single day.</p>
<p>Today, Shevchenko Garden stands as a testament to the city's cultural richness and the harmonious existence of nature and humanity. It continues to be a peaceful oasis where visitors can experience the beauty of nature and the spirit of Kharkiv in a peaceful setting.</p>

<p>Scientists have confirmed the presence of a gray whale off New England in North America recently.</p>
<p>The large sea animal disappeared from the Atlantic Ocean two centuries ago. The scientists are <strong>thrilled</strong> with the discovery but they say it shows the effects of climate change on sea life.</p>
<p>Researchers with the New England Aquarium in Boston found the gray whale on March 1. At the time, they were flying about 48 kilometers south of Nantucket, an island off the coast of Massachusetts in the Atlantic. The whale, which can weigh over 27,000 kilograms, usually lives in the northern Pacific Ocean.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo by Orla O'Brien shows a gray whale south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, on March 1, 2024.

<p>The gray whale disappeared from the Atlantic Ocean by the 18th century. But there have been five observations of the animal in the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters in the last 15 years, the aquarium said in a statement. The whale found this month was likely the same animal observed off the coast of Florida late last year, the aquarium said.</p>
<p>The researchers who found the animal off Massachusetts said they were not sure at first. But after circling the area for 45 minutes, they were able to take photographs that confirmed it was a gray whale.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to say out loud what it was, because it seemed <strong>crazy</strong>," said Orla O'Brien. She is a research scientist with the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.</p>
<p>Scientists said they were thrilled to see the animal, but its presence probably has to do with the warming of the planet. The Northwest Passage, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean in Canada, has lacked ice in the summertime in recent years, they said.</p>
<p>That means gray whales can travel through the passage in the summer when normally they would have been blocked, the scientists said. O'Brien said the animal's arrival off New England serves "as a reminder of how quickly <strong>marine species</strong> respond to climate change, given the chance."</p>
<p>Gray whales were almost completely killed off by hunting during the years of <strong>commercial</strong> whaling. Today, the whales have recovered to the point that they are considered a species of "least concern" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The organization, however, considers the western population of whales that live off the coast of Asia to be endangered.</p>
<p>They can be identified by the lack of a part of a body often seen on other whales: a dorsal fin. Also, they can be identified by their <strong>blotchy</strong> appearance which is different from the humpback and minke whales seen off New England. Gray whales can also be identified by the unusual sounds they make.</p>

            <title>Scientists Grow Mini-organs in Cells from Pregnancy Fluid  (2024/3/12)</title>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health and Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>British researchers say they have grown small human organs using cells removed from fluid that protects developing fetuses.</p>
<p>These organs are known as mini-organs, or organoids. They are extremely small, simple structures. They could be used in testing of new medical treatments or to study the workings of full-size organs.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This microscope image provided by researchers in March 2024 shows a lung organoid created from cells collected from amniotic fluid. (Giuseppe Cal&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;224;, Paolo De Coppi, Mattia Gerli via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4d2a-08dc3eb3e96f_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This microscope image provided by researchers in March 2024 shows a lung organoid created from cells collected from amniotic fluid. (Giuseppe Cal<i>&amp;#</i>224;, Paolo De Coppi, Mattia Gerli via AP)</span></div>
<p>The University College London carried out the study. Researchers collected the cells from fluid removed from 12 pregnant women during routine medical examinations at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.</p>
<p>The cells then were grown into organoids in a laboratory. The researchers said it was the first time such mini-organs had been produced from cells collected during an active pregnancy.</p>
<p>The scientists said they hope their method will lead to future methods for treating conditions present before birth.</p>
<p>Mattia Gerli of University College London was a lead writer of the study. He told the<em> </em>Associated Press (AP) that he and his team were "really excited" about how their research might result in important new treatment possibilities.</p>
<p>The findings were reported <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02807-z">in a study</a> that recently appeared in the publication <em>Nature Medicine.</em></p>
<p>Scientists have so far produced organoids that look like some human organs, including the brain, kidney, lung, stomach and liver. Lab-grown mini-organs are generally used to study how organs work without the need to experiment on real ones.</p>
<p>The scientists looked for which tissues the stem cells came from and then identified cells from three organs: lungs, kidneys and intestines.</p>
<p>In the past, organoids could only be created from adult stem cells or tissues collected after an abortion. An abortion is a medical operation to end a pregnancy.</p>
<p>The current method does not violate rules that govern direct removal of stem cells from fetal tissue. The amniotic fluid method permits scientists to get cells from fetuses during the <strong>latter</strong> parts of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Governments around the world have different <strong>regulations</strong> covering abortions. In Britain, the legal limit for ending a pregnancy is generally 22 weeks after <strong>conception</strong>. This rule prevents British researchers from studying some parts of normal human development or diseases that are present past 22 weeks.</p>

</span>
<p>In the United States, abortion restrictions differ by state. Most states ban the use of fetal tissue for research, said Alta Charo. She is a retired professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Charo was not part of the latest study.</p>
<p>Fetal tissue is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_4/4.1.14_human_fetal_tissue_research.htm#:~:text=Human%20fetal%20tissue%20is%20defined,or%20induced%20abortion%20or%20stillbirth.">defined</a> by the National Institutes of Health as material coming from a dead human embryo or fetus. The tissue could come from a fetus that was aborted or did not survive because of medical problems with the pregnancy. The use of tissue from an abortion has long been <strong>controversial</strong>.</p>
<p>Charo said the new method does not raise the same <strong>ethical </strong>concerns. And taking amniotic fluid during a woman's pregnancy "does not appear to add any physical risks to either fetus or pregnant woman," Charo said in an email to the AP.</p>
<p>As part of the experiments, the researchers worked with scientists in Belgium to study the development of babies with a condition called congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This can result in organs such as the liver and intestines getting displaced into the chest. About 30 percent of fetuses with this disease die because the lungs cannot fully develop. If doctors could identify the condition before birth, they could operate on a fetus to fix it.</p>
<p>In the experiments, researchers grew lung organoids from the cells of fetuses with the hernia condition before and after treatment. When comparing those organoids to organoids from healthy fetuses, the team was able to use the lab method to identify the affected child's condition before birth.</p>
<p>The scientists said this ability to study working, pre-birth mini-organs is the first step toward establishing more detailed <strong>prognosis</strong> information and improving treatment methods.</p>

<p>American film <em>Oppenheimer</em> was the big winner at the Academy Awards Sunday in Los Angeles, California. The Academy honored the film about a creator of the atomic bomb with seven Oscars.</p>
<p>The televised event presented a usual mix of moods and messages. There was a reminder of the recent death in a Russian prison of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Demonstrators called for a cease-fire in Gaza at a protest outside the Dolby Theatre where the event took place. And there was a bit of election-year politics from ceremony host Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
<p>But there was also joyful<strong> </strong>fun, as when actor Ryan Gosling performed <em>I'm</em> <em>Just Ken</em>, a nominated song from the film <em>Barbie</em>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Oppenheimer British film producer Emma Thomas (C) accepts the award for Best Picture onstage during the 96th Annual Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on March 10, 2024.

<p>The night, though, belonged not to <em>Barbie</em> but to its partner in the cultural event known as "Barbenheimer."</p>
<p><em>Oppenheimer's</em> seven wins include the top prize of best picture. Director Christopher Nolan also took home the Oscar for directing while the film's star Cillian Murphy received the best actor award. And <em>Oppenheimer's</em> Robert Downey Jr won the Oscar for best supporting actor. It is his first Academy Award.</p>
<p>Many of those wins were expected, but the Oscars did hold some surprises. The race for the best actress was considered very close this year. And, Emma Stone looked shocked when her name was called for her performance in the movie, <em>Poor Things</em>.</p>
<p>Stone won her first Oscar, also for best actress, in 2017 for <em>La La Land</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some more of the night's notable moments:</p>
<p>Jimmy Kimmel was hosting the Academy Awards for a fourth time. Late in the show he presented a social media post about the ceremony from former president Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"Thank you for watching," Kimmel said, adding, "isn't it past your jail time?"</p>
<p><strong>A call for peace In Ukraine...</strong></p>
<p><em>Associated Press</em> reporter Mstyslav Chernov, was one of the filmmakers accepting the best documentary Oscar for <em>20 Days in Mariupol</em>. He noted that it was the first Oscar in the history of his country, Ukraine. He said he was honored – but then added: "Probably I will be the first director on this stage to say I wish I'd never made this film." The film is an account of the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>Chernov called on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. "We can make sure that the history record is set straight ... and those who have given their lives, will never be forgotten," he said.</p>
<p><strong>And in Gaza</strong></p>
<p>Jonathan Glazer's <em>The Zone of Interest</em> takes place during World War II. It is about the family of a Nazi commandant living next to the Auschwitz death camp. But it was a current war that the writer-director spoke about when accepting his Oscar for best international film.</p>
<p>"Our film shows where dehumanization leads at its worst," Glazer said, before speaking about the conflict in Gaza. "Right now we stand here as men who <strong>refute</strong> their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people," he said. "Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanization, how do we resist?"</p>
<p><strong>A sad reminder</strong></p>
<p>"If they decide to kill me, it means that we are incredibly strong." Those words from Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, began the memorial to industry members who died over the year. He was the subject of last year's winning documentary, <em>Navalny</em>. His wife stood on the Oscar stage that night and spoke directly to him: "Alexei, I am dreaming of the day when you will be free and our country will be free," Yulia Navalnaya said.</p>
<p><strong>Nolan's ‘incredible journey'</strong></p>
<p>Winning his first directing Oscar, the 53-year-old Nolan noted that <strong>cinema</strong> is just over 100 years old. "Imagine being there 100 years into painting or theater. We don't know where this <strong>incredible journey</strong> is going from here. But to know that you think that I'm a meaningful part of it means the world to me."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>Kate, Britain's Princess of Wales, apologized Monday for "any confusion" caused by a photo released over the weekend. The official photo was the first image of the princess since she had a medical operation nearly two months ago.<br/>
英国威尔士王妃凯特周一为周末发布的一张照片造成的“任何混乱”道歉。这张官方照片是凯特王妃近两个月前接受医疗手术后的第一张照片。</p>
<p>Kensington Palace released the photograph on social media on Sunday. It showed the 42-year-old Kate looking healthy and sitting and smiling in a chair surrounded by her three children. The photo was credited to Kate's husband, Prince William, and was said to have been taken earlier in the week in Windsor.<br/>
肯辛顿宫周日在社交媒体上发布了这张照片。照片显示，42岁的凯特看起来很健康，她坐在椅子上面带微笑，身边环绕着她的三个孩子。这张照片被当成凯特王妃的丈夫威廉王子的作品，据说是本周早些时候在温莎城堡拍摄的。</p>
<p>In a message on X, Kate wrote, "Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months." Her message also wished people a "Happy Mother's Day," as Britain celebrated the holiday on Sunday.<br/>
凯特在X网站上的一条消息中写道：“感谢你们过去两个月里的善意祝福和持续支持。”在英国周日庆祝母亲节之际，凯特还祝人们“母亲节快乐”。</p>
<p>But shortly after the photo was published, some royal observers online began raising questions about whether the picture had been changed in some ways with image editing tools.<br/>
但在照片发布后不久，网络上的一些王室观察人员开始质疑这张照片是否经过了图像编辑工具的某种修改。</p>
<p>
After close examination, several major news organizations withdrew the photo, saying it did in fact appear to have been edited in some way. Because of these changes, the picture did not meet the requirements set by those news organizations.<br/>
经过仔细检查，几家主要新闻机构撤回了这张照片，称其实际上似乎经过了某种编辑。由于这些改动，图片不符合这些新闻机构设定的要求。</p>
<p>After the questions about the image were raised, Kate issued another message on X. She wrote, "Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused."<br/>
在人们对这张照片提出质疑后，凯特在X上发布了另一条消息。她写道：“和许多业余摄影师一样，我偶尔也会尝试修图。我想对我们昨天分享的全家福造成的任何混乱表示歉意。”</p>
<p>Among the news agencies withdrawing the photo were The Associated Press, Reuters, the French news agency AFP, Getty Images, and Britain's Press Association.<br/>
撤回这张照片的新闻机构包括美联社、路透社、法国法新社、盖蒂图片社和英国新闻协会。</p>
<p>Photo editors for Reuters said their examinations of the image showed the left arm of Kate's daughter, Princess Charlotte, did not seem to line up naturally with her body in the picture. This suggested that editing changes had been made to the photo.<br/>
路透社的图片编辑表示，他们对照片的检查显示，凯特王妃的女儿夏洛特公主的左臂似乎与照片中的身体对不上。这表明对照片进行了编辑更改。</p>
<p>Different news agencies have different policies regarding how much an image can be changed before being released. Both Reuters and the AP said the changes violated their editorial rules. Most news organizations generally only permit minor photo editing, such as cropping and making light and color changes.<br/>
各家新闻机构对图片在发布前可以有多大调整有着不同的政策。路透社和美联社都表示，这些调整违反了他们的编辑规则。大多数新闻机构通常只允许对照片进行小的编辑，如裁剪、调整光线和颜色。</p>
<p>The picture had already drawn widespread media attention online. This is because it was the first official image of Kate since she spent two weeks in the hospital after undergoing an abdominal operation in January. Her exact condition was not identified.<br/>
这张照片已经在网上引起了媒体的广泛关注。这是凯特一月份接受腹部手术并住院两周后的第一张官方照片。她的确切情况尚未确定。</p>
<p>Kate's office had said during her absence that she was recovering well and was not expected to return to her public duties until after Easter, which is March 31.<br/>
凯特办公室在她缺席期间表示，她恢复得很好，预计要到3月31日复活节后才能重返公职。</p>

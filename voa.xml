        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Japan's space agency says a spacecraft that landed on the moon earlier this month has regained power and is continuing its mission.<br/>
日本的太空机构表示，本月早些时候登陆月球的一艘航天器已经恢复动力，并正在继续执行任务。</p>
<p>Officials from the Japan Exploration Agency (JAXA) said Monday they had successfully reestablished communication with the SLIM moon explorer.<br/>
日本宇宙航空研究开发机构（JAXA）的官员周一表示，他们已经成功地与SLIM月球探测器重新建立了通信。</p>
<p>SLIM touched down on the moon on January 20. But the spacecraft landed the wrong way up. Its solar equipment was unable to see the sun. JAXA said SLIM was likely able to regain power because of a change in the sun's direction.<br/>
SLIM于1月20日登陆月球。但飞船降落的方向不对。它的太阳能设备无法接受到阳光。JAXA表示，由于太阳朝向的改变，SLIM很可能能够重新获得动力。</p>
<p>After the landing, JAXA used the spacecraft's battery power to gather as much data as possible about the touchdown and the surrounding area. The power was then turned off to wait for the sun to rise higher in the lunar sky.<br/>
着陆后，日本宇宙航空研究开发机构利用航天器的电池电量收集了尽可能多的关于着陆点和周围区域的数据。然后关闭电源，等待太阳在月球上空升起得更高。</p>
<p>Mission officials have said the explorer landed within 55 meters of its target near the lunar equator. It also landed in between two craters in an area covered in volcanic rock. JAXA said these results demonstrated progress in what it calls "pinpoint" landing technology.<br/>
任务官员表示，该探测器在月球赤道附近距离目标55米以内着陆。它还降落在覆盖着火山岩的两个火山口之间。日本宇宙航空研究开发机构表示，这些结果证明了其所谓的“精确定位”着陆技术的进步。</p>
<p>Past moon missions generally aimed to hit flat areas at least 10 kilometers wide. But the ability to land on very exact targets is expected to help support future space vehicles traveling to the moon and other places.<br/>
过去的月球任务通常旨在抵达至少10公里宽的平坦区域。但是，降落在非常精确的目标上的能力预计将有助于支持未来前往月球和其他星球的太空飞行器。</p>
<p>The main purpose of the mission was to test the possibility that spacecraft can land on very specific targets. But SLIM is also capturing images and released two small explorers. The explorers are designed to examine mineral-rich rocks and collect data on the moon's development.<br/>
这次任务的主要目的是测试航天器能够降落在非常特定的目标上的可能性。但SLIM也在拍摄图像，并释放了两台小型探测车。探测车的任务是检查富含矿物质的岩石，并收集有关月球发展的数据。</p>
<p>JAXA has not named a specific date for when SLIM will end its operations on the moon. But the agency has said in the past that the lander was not designed to survive a lunar night. The next lunar night begins on Thursday.<br/>
日本宇宙航空研究开发机构尚未确定SLIM结束其月球使命的具体日期。但该机构过去曾表示，着陆器的设计不适用于月夜生存。下一个月夜从星期四开始。</p>
<p>The mission made Japan the fifth country in the world to successfully land on the surface of the moon, after the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India.<br/>
这次任务使日本成为继美国、苏联、中国和印度之后，世界上第五个成功登上月球表面的国家。</p>

            <title>Studies: Gene Treatment Lets Children Deaf at Birth Hear  (2024/1/30)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Gene treatments are being credited with permitting several children born with deafness to hear again.</p>
<p>Gene therapy is a medical treatment that aims to change a few of a patient's genes to cure a genetic disease.</p>
<p>A small study recently published in <em>The Lancet</em> reported improvements in the hearing in five of six children who were treated in China.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by researchers in January 2024, Dr. Yilai Shu examines a young patient at the Eye &amp; ENT Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, China, after a gene therapy procedure for hereditary deafness.

<p>Around the same time, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the U.S. eastern state of Pennsylvania announced similar improvements in an 11-year-old boy treated there. And earlier, Chinese researchers published a study showing similar improvements in two other children.</p>
<p>The experimental methods, or therapies, target only one rare condition. But scientists say similar treatments could someday help many more children with other kinds of deafness caused by genes.</p>
<p>Around the world, 34 million children have deafness or hearing loss. And information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says genes are responsible for up to 60 percent of cases.</p>
<p>Deafness caused by genes is passed down from parents to children. It is called <strong>hereditary</strong> deafness. It is the latest condition scientists are targeting with gene therapy. Gene therapy is already approved to treat illnesses such as sickle cell disease and severe hemophilia.</p>
<p>Children with hereditary deafness often get a device called a cochlear <strong>implant</strong> that helps them hear sound.</p>
<p>"No treatment could <strong>reverse</strong> hearing loss...That's why we were always trying to develop a therapy," said Zheng-Yi Chen of Boston's Mass Eye and Ear, a treatment center for eye and ear problems. He is a writer of the study published in <em>The Lancet</em>. "We couldn't be more happy or <strong>excited</strong> about the results."</p>
<p><strong>Treatment results</strong></p>
<p>The team recorded videos of patients. One shows a baby, who formerly could not hear at all, looking back in response to a doctor's words six weeks after treatment. Another shows a little girl 13 weeks after treatment repeating father, mother, grandmother, sister, and "I love you."</p>
<p>All the children in the experiments have a condition that is believed to cause two to eight percent of hereditary deafness. It is caused by changes in a gene responsible for an inner ear protein called otoferlin, which helps hair cells send sound signals to the brain.</p>
<p>The researchers say that the one-time therapy gives a working copy of that gene to the inner ear during a medical operation. Most of the children were treated in one ear, although one child in the two-person study was treated in both ears.</p>
<p>The study with six children took place at Fudan University in Shanghai. Dr. Yilai Shu helped lead the study and trained in Chen's laboratory. Chen was involved in the research. Chinese science organizations and biotechnology company Shanghai Refreshgene Therapeutics helped provide financial support.</p>
<p>Researchers observed the children for about six months. They do not know why the treatment did not work in one of them. But the five others, who were completely deaf, can now hear a normal discussion, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Chen estimated they now hear at a level 60 percent to 70 percent of normal. The therapy caused no major side effects.</p>
<p>Early results from other research have shown similar results.</p>
<p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company based in New York state. It announced in October that a child under two years old showed improvements six weeks after gene therapy. The results came from a study Regeneron did with support from Decibel Therapeutics, a company in Boston.</p>
<p>Columbia University's Dr. Lawrence Lustig is involved in the Regeneron study. He said although the children in these studies do not end up with very good hearing, "even a moderate hearing loss recovery in these kids is <strong>pretty astounding</strong>."</p>
<p>He added that many questions remain. They include how long the therapies will last and if hearing will continue to improve in the children.</p>
<p>Some people question if gene therapy for deafness is <strong>ethical</strong>.</p>
<p>Teresa Blankmeyer Burke is a professor who is deaf and who deals with medical ethics. She teaches at Gallaudet University, a university for deaf people in Washington, D.C. She said that there is no agreement about the need for gene therapy targeting deafness.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that deafness does not cause severe or deadly illness. Blankmeyer Burke said that it is important to work with deaf community members about the importance of gene therapy. She added gene therapy is seen by many as a possible threat to "signing Deaf communities."</p>
<p>However, Chen said: "This is real proof showing gene therapy is working." And he added, "It opens up the whole field."</p>

<p>The social media site X has blocked some searches for Taylor Swift in reaction to an online spread of <strong>pornographic </strong>deepfake images of the singer.</p>
<p>A "deepfake" is an image, sound recording, or video created to make it appear that people in it are saying or doing things that they did not say or do.</p>
<p>Attempts to search for her name without <strong>quotation </strong>marks on the site Monday resulted in a failure<strong> </strong>message. It asked users to retry their search. "Don't <strong>fret</strong> — it's not your fault," also appeared.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Taylor Swift wears a Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce jacket as she arrives before an NFL wild-card playoff football game between the Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins, Saturday, Jan. 13, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo.

<p>However, putting quotation marks around her name permitted posts to show where her name appeared.</p>
<p>The images of Swift began spreading widely on X last week. She is now the most famous victim of a danger that technology companies and anti-abuse groups have struggled to fix.</p>
<p>"This is a temporary action and done with an <strong>abundance</strong> of <strong>caution</strong> as we <strong>prioritize</strong> safety on this issue," Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, said in a statement.</p>
<p>After the images began spreading, the singer's loyal fan base, called "Swifties," quickly came to her defense. They launched a protective movement and flooded the site with more positive images of the singer. They used the hashtag #ProtectTaylorSwift on their posts. Some said they were reporting accounts that were sharing the deepfakes.</p>
<p>The deepfake-search group Reality Defender said it followed many posts of pornographic material of Swift. Many of the posts were found on X, formerly known as Twitter. Some images also made their way to Facebook and other social media sites.</p>
<p>The researchers found at least 20 different images created by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Researchers have said the number of pornographic deepfakes has grown in the past few years. The increase continues as the technology used to produce such images has become more available and easier to use.</p>
<p>In 2019, a report released by the AI company DeepTrace Labs showed these images were mainly weaponized against women. Most of the victims, it said, were Hollywood actors and South Korean singers.</p>

<span class="datetime">28 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A Mars explorer has discovered new evidence of a large amount of water ice buried near the planet's <strong>equator</strong>.</p>
<p>The discovery was made with data collected by the Mars Express orbiter. The spacecraft is operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). The American space agency NASA is a partner on the orbiter's <strong>mission</strong>.</p>
<p>ESA launched Mars Express in 2003 and it has been studying the Red Planet ever since. The mission's main goal is to use its seven scientific instruments to search for signs of water underneath the surface of Mars.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This high-resolution image, taken by a camera aboard ESA's Mars Express spacecraft, shows part of the Medusa Fossae formation and surrounding areas near the equator of Mars. (ESA/DLR/FU Berlin (G.

(ESA/DLR/FU Berlin (G. Neukum))</span></div>
<p>Scientists involved in the new research say data suggesting the presence of newly discovered ice <strong>deposits</strong> could mean Mars may have once supported life.</p>
<p>The Mars Express orbiter collected data around an area of the planet known as the Medusae Fossae Formation (or MFF). NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia03770-medusae-fossae-formation">describes</a> this formation as "a soft, easily <strong>eroded</strong> deposit that extends for nearly 1,000 kilometers along the equator of Mars."</p>
<p>Scientists believe the MFF was most likely formed by wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. The formations could have formed after volcanic activity estimated to have taken place up to 3.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Images of the area show raised areas that scientists thought in the past might contain dust blown around the planet by wind over many years. But the new research used newer data collected by the orbiter's MARSIS instrument. It is "a subsurface radar sounder" with a 40-meter-long <strong>antenna</strong>. The tool looks for water on the surface, as well as up to five kilometers below the surface.</p>
<p>The MARSIS instrument is designed to send radio waves to an area scientists choose. It then attempts to listen to and examine "<strong>echoes</strong>" produced by the radio waves. The echoes help researchers recognize where water or ice might be, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/express/mission/sc_science_marsis01.html">explains</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists say any water identified near the surface results in stronger signals while the presence of ice or other materials would produce weaker signals. The team said MARSIS readings suggest the MFF area of Mars contains a large amount of water ice rather than wind-blown dust.</p>
<p>Thomas Watters of the U.S. Smithsonian Institution led the new research. His team's findings were recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105490">published in a study</a> in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Buried_water_ice_at_Mars_s_equator">said in a statement</a> the radar data showed the deposits in the MFF area were even thicker than earlier measurement estimates had shown.</p>
<p>The researchers said the data showed the examined deposits extended beneath the Mars surface to depths up to 3.7 kilometers. They seemed to contain "<strong>layers</strong> of dust and ice, all topped by a protective layer of dry dust or ash."</p>
<p>Earlier data examinations of the MFF area found similarities in the electrical properties of deposits there to ice-rich deposits found in the planet's north and south poles. The latest MARSIS data strengthens this evidence by suggesting similarities between deposit layering in the MFF and the planet's poles.</p>
<p>"The radar signals <strong>match</strong> what we'd expect to see from layered ice," Watters said. He added that the radar waves were found to be "similar to signals we see from Mars's polar caps, which we know to be very ice rich."</p>
<p>It is not the first time scientists have discovered strong evidence for the presence of water ice on Mars. But the researchers say the latest study suggests the largest amount of water ever identified in the MFF area. They estimated the total amount of water contained there would be enough "to cover the surface of Mars to a depth of about 1.5 to 3 meters."</p>
<p>Colin Wilson is a project scientist with the Mars Express mission. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Buried_water_ice_at_Mars_s_equator">said</a> while the new finding is exciting, it also "raises as many questions as answers." He continued, "How long ago did these ice deposits form, and what was Mars like at that time?" Wilson said if confirmed to be water ice, the large deposits "would change our understanding of Mars climate history."</p>
<p>Watters added that since the discovery was made in an area near the Martian equator, it could be considered a good place for future exploration missions. He explained that with a lower <strong>elevation</strong>, the MFF area would be considered "an ideal landing spot for spacecraft." Such an elevation provides more atmosphere to support an effective, controlled landing, Watters said.</p>

            <title>Apple Releases New Stolen Device Protection  (2024/1/29)</title>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Imagine that you are in a crowded place. You do not notice, but someone is watching you and learns your iPhone passcode. Then, they steal your phone. Suddenly, your photos, documents, financial information, and the rest of your digital life have been taken from you.</p>
<p>A new security feature may prevent such a situation from happening. Apple, the iPhone maker, recently released an update to its iOS operating system. It has a new feature called Stolen Device Protection. The feature makes it a lot harder for phone <strong>thieves</strong> to open the device and <strong>access</strong> important functions and settings.</p>
<p>The company is urging users to turn this feature on immediately. Here is how to turn on the new security feature and why it is so important to do so.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An Apple iPhone 15 advertisement is seen as it officially goes on sale across China at an Apple Store in Shanghai, China September 22, 2023. (REUTERS/Aly Song)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-410f-08dbbb5c0d64_cx6_cy13_cw93_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An Apple iPhone 15 advertisement is seen as it officially goes on sale across China at an Apple Store in Shanghai, China September 22, 2023. (REUTERS/Aly Song)</span></div>
<p><strong>Should I turn on Stolen Device Protection?</strong></p>
<p>Stolen Device Protection is a new setting that is included with the latest iOS release, version 17.3. The update for iPhones and iPads includes a new feature designed to prevent thieves from <strong>wiping</strong> phones for resale or getting to your Apple ID or other important accounts.</p>
<p>Apple says the feature adds extra security for users. It addresses a <strong>vulnerability</strong> that thieves have used to lock device owners out of their Apple accounts, <strong>delete</strong> their photos and other files from their iCloud, and take money from their bank accounts.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Stolen Device Protection <strong>keeps track</strong> of a user's "familiar locations," such as their home or workplace. The feature adds extra biometric security if someone tries to use the device to do certain things away from those places.</p>
<p>It also reduces the importance of passcodes. Instead, it favors "biometric" features such as faces or fingerprints, which are a lot harder to copy.</p>
<p>If a thief tries to <strong>erase</strong> or reset an iPhone, the device will require a Face ID or Touch ID scan to confirm that the person is the rightful owner. The new feature does not let someone use the passcode or any other backup method.</p>
<p>Another part of the new feature is designed to slow down thieves trying to change security settings. For example, if someone tries to sign out of an Apple ID account, change the passcode or reset the phone in an unfamiliar <strong>location</strong>, they will have to <strong>authenticate</strong> using Face ID or Touch ID, wait an hour, and then do a second facial or fingerprint scan.</p>
<p>Changing an Apple ID password, updating Apple ID security settings, adding or removing Face or Touch ID, and turning off the Find My device feature or Stolen Device Protection also will <strong>trigger</strong> this feature.</p>
<p>Apple said the delay is meant to prevent a thief from performing these operations so you can mark your device as lost and secure your Apple account.</p>
<p>The company added that, "When your iPhone is in a familiar location, these additional steps will not be required and you can use your device passcode like normal."</p>
<p><strong>How do I turn it on?</strong></p>
<p>First, download and update your iPhone or iPad with the latest iOS update. The update works for iPhone XS and newer models, including second- and third-generation SE models.</p>
<p>Then go to your settings, scroll down to "Face ID &amp; Passcode" or "Touch ID &amp; Passcode" and enter your passcode. Scroll down and you'll see Stolen Device Protection.</p>
<p>Make sure you have turned on two-factor authentication and Find My device for your Apple ID account. Otherwise, it will not show up.</p>

<span class="datetime">28 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Scientists have found four groups of emperor penguins in Antarctica that they did not know about before. These groups, called "<strong>colonies</strong>," were found with new satellite images.</p>
<p>Emperor penguins are the world's largest penguins, sea birds that cannot fly but that swim. They are consider "near threatened." This means the animals might have reduced numbers or live in fewer areas than before.</p>
<p>The penguins raise their babies, called chicks, during the Antarctic winter on areas of frozen sea ice. If the ice breaks up before the chicks grow up, many of the chicks might die.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated photo provided by the British Antarctic Survey in January 2024 shows adult emperor penguins with a chick near Halley Research Station in Antarctica. (British Antarctic Survey via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/22389179-9dd7-4bd6-a0b6-4c8200ec1b62_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This undated photo provided by the British Antarctic Survey in January 2024 shows adult emperor penguins with a chick near Halley Research Station in Antarctica. (British Antarctic Survey via AP)</span></div>
<p>Recently released research says that some of the penguins are moving away from their old colonies.</p>
<p>Peter Fretwell is a researcher at the British Antarctic Survey, a government organization. He said that conditions at one colony had become more dangerous since 2016. As a result, the colony near Halley Bay seems to have moved about 30 kilometers east.</p>
<p>He said, "Emperor penguins have taken it upon themselves to try to find more <strong>stable</strong> sea ice."</p>
<p>Fretwell said that the four new colonies have likely existed for years, but scientists have just recently seen them. They are small colonies with less than 1000 <strong>pairs</strong> of penguins, Fretwell said.</p>
<p>Scientists have identified 66 emperor penguin colonies and fewer than 300,000 <strong>breeding</strong> pairs. The four newly found colonies do not change population estimates for the birds very much. However, Fretwell said the fact that one of the colonies moved helps scientists to understand where the birds are going.</p>
<p>Daniel Zitterbart is a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the U.S. eastern state of Massachusetts. He was not involved in the study of the newly found penguins. But he said that it is unclear if the new groups broke away from the larger colonies.</p>
<p>Zitterbart said that the places where the penguins <strong>reproduce </strong>are changing and that, as the world warms, more "penguins will be on the move."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars to become competitive in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.<br/>
沙特阿拉伯花费了数十亿美元，让自己在电动汽车行业具有竞争力。</p>
<p>Such efforts are part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's broader plan to create jobs and diversify the country's economy. The kingdom has invested at least $10 billion in Lucid Motors, a United States-based company. It also set up a Saudi EV company, Ceer, and built an EV metals factory.<br/>
这些努力是沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼创造就业机会和实现国家经济多样化的宏大计划的一部分。沙特已向总部位于美国的Lucid Motors公司投资至少100亿美元。它还成立了一家沙特电动汽车公司Ceer，并建造了一家电动汽车金属工厂。</p>
<p>The Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's $700 billion sovereign wealth fund, has a goal to produce 500,000 EVs yearly by 2030, up from a target of 150,000 in 2026.<br/>
作为管理7000亿美元的主权财富基金，沙特公共投资基金的目标是到2030年每年生产50万辆电动汽车，而2026年的目标是每年生产15万辆。</p>
<p>Yet by December, Ceer, which opened in September 2023, had put together around 800 vehicles. Those vehicles were based on kits supplied from the U.S. state of Arizona.<br/>
然而截至去年12月，于2023年9月开业的Ceer公司已经组装了约800辆汽车。这些车辆是基于美国亚利桑那州提供的套件。</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has failed in the past to appeal to foreign car makers.<br/>
沙特阿拉伯过去未能吸引外国汽车制造商。</p>
<p>Japan's Toyota rejected a proposed deal with Saudi Arabia in 2019. The company said labor costs were too high, local suppliers were too few, and the market was too small.<br/>
2019年，日本丰田公司拒绝了与沙特阿拉伯的一项拟议交易。该公司表示，沙特劳动力成本太高，当地供应商太少，市场太小。</p>
<p>As the world moves away from cars fueled by oil, experts say Saudi Arabia faces competition in the EV industry.<br/>
专家表示，随着世界逐渐放弃以石油为燃料的汽车，沙特阿拉伯在电动汽车行业面临竞争。</p>
<p>"There is tremendous competition that the country will face from established manufacturing power houses and from established supply chains," said Gaurav Batra of EY, a business advisory company.<br/>
安永商业咨询公司的高罗夫·巴特拉表示：“沙特将面临来自老牌制造业巨头和老牌供应链的巨大竞争。”</p>
<p>Batra added, "A lot of things need to come into place before this industry takes shape and really ignites."<br/>
巴特拉补充道：“在这个行业成型并真正爆发之前，需要做很多事情。”</p>
<p>Saudi officials did not respond to Reuters news agency requests for comment.<br/>
沙特官员没有回应路透社的置评请求。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">EV production<br/>
电动汽车生产</span></p>
<p>China currently leads the new supply chain as well as EV production. Chinese company BYD became the world's biggest maker of EVs last year, pushing Tesla motors into 2nd place.<br/>
中国目前在这条全新供应链和电动汽车生产方面处于领先地位。中国比亚迪公司去年成为全球最大的电动汽车制造商，将特斯拉汽车挤至第二位。</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia faces a lack of auto parts supply - anything from car doors to engines. There is no major local industry to produce these goods.<br/>
沙特阿拉伯面临着汽车零部件供应短缺的问题，从车门到发动机，无所不包。当地没有大型产业可以生产这些产品。</p>
<p>The EV manufacturer Ceer, a joint project between the PIF and Taiwanese company Foxconn, plans to launch a car by 2025. But the company has not yet built its factory.<br/>
电动汽车制造商Ceer是沙特公共投资基金和中国台湾省富士康公司的联合项目，该公司计划在2025年前推出一款汽车。但该公司尚未建厂。</p>
<p>A source connected to Ceer said it was unlikely the company would have a vehicle on the road before 2026. The source spoke on condition that they not be identified.<br/>
一位与Ceer有关的消息人士表示，该公司在2026年之前不太可能有车辆上路。该消息人士要求匿名。</p>
<p>In October, South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai and the PIF announced a project to build a factory for traditional engine vehicles and electric vehicles. The project, along with those of Lucid and Ceer, would create a group of factories in Jeddah's King Abdullah Economic City.<br/>
10月，韩国汽车制造商现代汽车和沙特公共投资基金宣布了一个项目，将为传统发动机汽车和电动汽车建造一个工厂。该项目连同Lucid和Ceer的项目一起，将在吉达市的阿卜杜拉国王经济城创建一批工厂。</p>
<p>Ceer will get parts from Germany's BMW automobile company, including batteries, the highest cost single part of an EV.<br/>
Ceer将从德国宝马汽车公司获得零部件，包括电池，这是电动汽车中成本最高的单个零部件。</p>
<p>Lucid vice president Faisal Sultan told Reuters in December that Saudi Arabia needed the presence of critical suppliers. He said the Saudi factory only rebuilt vehicles and the Arizona site carried out quality control testing.<br/>
Lucid副总裁费萨尔·苏丹12月告诉路透社，沙特阿拉伯需要关键供应商的存在。他说，沙特工厂只是重新组装了车辆，亚利桑那州工厂进行了质量控制测试。</p>
<p>The company's idea - keeping the supply chain and vehicle manufacturing in the United States - could lead other companies to set up rebuild sites as well. As a result, these companies might be able to get Saudi incentives, a Saudi auto industry leader said.<br/>
该公司将供应链和汽车制造留在美国的想法可能会导致其他公司也建立组装基地。一位沙特汽车行业领袖表示，因此，这些公司可能能够获得沙特的激励。</p>
<p>But such moves could slow the growth of local Saudi manufacturing as the country would continue to import foreign-made cars.<br/>
但这些举措可能会减缓沙特当地制造业的增长，因为该国将继续进口外国制造的汽车。</p>

<p>Many people first heard about Apple's Macintosh computer through a television <strong>commercial</strong> during the American football Super Bowl game in 1984.</p>
<p>However, the commercial did not show a computer at all. It showed a woman throwing a hammer at a large screen. On the screen was a man giving a speech. The screen exploded and an announcer said, "Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. ... And you'll see why 1984 won't be like ‘1984.'"</p>
<p><em>1984</em> is George Orwell's book about an <strong>authoritarian</strong> government. And Apple aimed to tell people that the new computer would be different. It would be easy to use.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Part of an early model central processing unit is seen on display at the Computer History Museum on January 19, 2024 in Mountain View, California, as the museum celebrates Mac's 40th birthday.

<p><strong>Made with humans in mind</strong></p>
<p>Many computers at the time only did one or two things. And they required the user to type complex commands to start the programs.</p>
<p>Jacob O. Wobbrock is a professor of information at the University of Washington. He wrote about Apple's commercial in <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>
<p>Apple "was selling a product for human beings to use," Wobbrock writes. After the commercial, he suggests, Apple became known for design and the world started paying attention to the idea of user experience, or human-computer interaction.</p>
<p>"The Macintosh was one of the first products to really <strong>prioritize</strong> user experience and <strong>focus</strong> on making something useable and understandable, learnable even guessable. So that people didn't have to always read a <strong>manual</strong> to learn how to use it."</p>
<p>Mackenzie Bristow is a former language teacher and researcher who now works in user experience in Atlanta, Georgia. She said Macintosh was one of the first products to think about "the user."</p>
<p>"What is the role of the person? What is the role of the user?" she asked. She explained that in design, the rule is "first, understand the person" before thinking about what the product looks like and what it can do.</p>
<p>Forty years after the launch of the Macintosh computer, we now see computer screens everywhere – at restaurants, at airports and even in cars. All of those devices have been designed by experts in user experience.</p>
<p><strong>STEM plus ‘soft skills'</strong></p>
<p>Many colleges and universities now offer study programs in user experience.</p>
<p>While it is part of STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – Wobbrock said students from different areas of study, including psychology or communication, could be successful.</p>
<p>"The kind of student that <strong>thrives</strong> in user experience is a student who has above all else, a real curiosity about how people <strong>interact</strong> with technology. ... And students whose first language is not English can absolutely do well in user experience."</p>
<p>One of those students is Kartik Sundaram of India. He studied computer science at the University of Michigan and chose user experience for his <strong>graduate</strong> study. He finished last year and is now teaching the subject.</p>
<p>"I never felt like I had a personal desire to pursue [computer science]," he said. He called the work "very <strong>isolating</strong>." For fun, he took a photography class. While in the class, he met someone who was studying in the User Experience Research and Design program.</p>
<p>"He told me about how, you know, it's like this <strong>blend</strong> of design and people and technology, and that kind of lit a fire in my heart to say ok, this seems a lot more interesting, ... ‘let's jump right in, let's learn more about it and let's apply to that school."</p>
<p>Sundaram said user experience is good for people who are "personable and good at making connections." Some of those are called ‘soft skills,' he said. And "the soft skills really matter."</p>
<p>While he grew up speaking English, Sundaram said the world of user experience is more and more open to people who are learning English or who may speak with an accent.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's an expectation that your English is <strong>flawless</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Bristow said the ability to speak more than one language "is kind of a super power in user experience," because those people are comfortable interacting with many different kinds of people. "That's really something to be celebrated," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Future of UX and job outlook</strong></p>
<p>Sundaram is teaching but also looking for work in the field. Wobbrock is a professor and Bristow works on training programs for a large company.</p>
<p>They each spoke about the need for user experience professionals to work in the expanding field of artificial intelligence, or AI.</p>
<p>Sundaram said "We're not going to be restricted to a text box in ChatGPT for much longer. There are going to be other ways to interact with it."</p>
<p>Bristow said the ability to understand language is important. AI programs will need experts who understand how language changes based on where people live, their level of education and their age.</p>
<p>Wobbrock said user experience professionals are starting to work on projects called human-AI interaction. "There will be a great need for user experience professionals to help understand how people and AI can interact and work together in profitable ways," he added.</p>
<p>But Sundaram warned that user experience study programs, also known as UX, are becoming very popular. He said some students see UX as a field to make a lot of money with few <strong>certification</strong> requirements.<strong> </strong>And several companies are letting go of people with experience in the field.</p>
<p>Sundaram said, "It's definitely a difficult market, but it's an incredible field and there are new <strong>interfaces</strong> coming out that need our work."</p>

<p>In a recent science report<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/while-us-freezes-much-of-the-world-experiences-record-heat/7445844.html"> we explained</a> about a weather system called the polar vortex. It caused a <u>snowball effect</u> on extreme weather around the world. The event led to record-high temperatures in many parts of the world. But much of North America had to deal with extreme cold. Some areas recorded temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Mist from the Great Falls has created a frozen wonderland around the waterfalls in Paterson, New Jersey, Jan. 18, 2024.

<p>In an earlier Words and Their Stories program, we explained how to use the expression <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/when-does-a-problem-snowball-/7398657.html">snowball effect</a> to describe a situation where one action or event causes many other similar actions or events.</p>
<p>Are you thinking that there must be many more English expressions related to snow, ice, and cold weather? You are right! The term "snowball effect" is just the <u>tip of the iceberg</u>!</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, we have many more expressions in American English related to the cold weather. So, today we will explore some winter words and expressions.</p>
<p>In the <u>dead of winter</u>, many people like to skate on frozen lakes. But watch out! You don't want to <u>skate on thin ice</u>. That is dangerous. If it breaks you could fall into the cold, dark water below. You could even drown.</p>
<p>So, the expression <u>skating on thin ice</u> serves as a warning. For example, if a friend is always late to work, you might tell him he is <u>skating on thin ice</u> with his employer.</p>
<p>But, you might not want to say anything to your friend. Maybe it is none of your business when your friend arrives at work. So, you decide to <u>put your warning on ice.</u></p>
<p>To <u>put something on ice</u> means to suspend action on something – a temporary halt. In fact, today a co-worker asked me to <u>put my project on ice</u>, so I would have time to help her with today's lesson.</p>
<p>When we put food on ice we <strong>preserve</strong> its quality for a time. We can wait to eat it later and it will still be good.</p>
<p>What about when we <u>break the ice</u>, though? That sounds dangerous, right? However, it just means reaching out personally to a stranger. Like in this example:</p>
<p><em>A: Hi Matt. Have you met our new teacher, Jennifer?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No. Not yet.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Why don't you <u>break the ice</u> and <strong>introduce</strong> yourself this afternoon?</em></p>
<p><em>B: I certainly will.</em></p>
<p>Ice is not all we might face in winter. Sometimes the snow is so deep we cannot even get out of the house. At those times, you might say there is a <u>snowball's chance in hell</u> I'm leaving home today.</p>
<p>Hell is fiery and extremely hot. A snowball has no chance at survival there. So, the expression describes something that is impossible.</p>
<p>Now that we are stuck inside the house, we say we are <u>snowbound</u> or <u>snowed under</u>. And we often use <u>snowed under</u> to describe a situation in which we have too much work to do.</p>
<p>American children usually love a <u>snow day</u>! That phrase is used to mean schools are closed. Students might spend the day outdoors throwing <u>snowballs</u> or building a <u>snowman</u>. Or maybe they stay inside, covered up in a warm blanket next to a hot fire, <u>snug as a bug in a rug</u>.</p>
<p>We use the expression <u>snug as a bug in a rug</u> to describe a soft, warm and safe position or situation.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great place to be, especially during a snow storm. I mean, no one wants to be <u>left out in the cold</u>. That can really hurt, physically and emotionally!</p>
<p>Sometimes we use this phrase, <u>left out in the cold</u>, when someone has rejected or forgotten us.</p>
<p>We will never leave English learners <u>out in the cold</u>, to be sure! Especially not in <u>the dead of winter!</u></p>
<p>And that's <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>

            <title>Kenya Moving Rhinos to New Home  (2024/1/28)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Kenya began its biggest rhino <strong>relocation</strong> project earlier this month. Workers began the difficult work of moving 21 of the <strong>endangered</strong> animals to a new home. They each weigh around one metric ton.</p>
<p>A previous attempt at moving rhinos in the East African nation was a disaster in 2018. All 11 of the animals died.</p>
<p>The latest project experienced early troubles. A rhino targeted for moving was successfully hit with a <strong>tranquilizer</strong> shot from a helicopter but ended up in a creek. Veterinarians and park rangers held the rhino's head above water with a rope to save it while a tranquilizer <strong>reversal</strong> drug took effect. It was then released.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and capture team pull out a sedated black rhino from the water in Nairobi National Park, Kenya Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-36ae-08dc1dc5a57f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and capture team pull out a sedated black rhino from the water in Nairobi National Park, Kenya Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga)</span></div>
<p>Wildlife officials have said that the difficult project will take time, likely weeks.</p>
<p>The black rhinos are a mix of males and females. They are being moved from three conservation parks to the private Loisaba Conservancy in central Kenya, the Kenya Wildlife Service said. They are being moved because there are too many in the three parks. They need more space to <strong>roam</strong> and, hopefully, to breed.</p>
<p>Rhinos generally spend time alone and are at their happiest in large territories.</p>
<p>Kenya has had some success in saving its black rhino population. In the mid-1980s the rhino population fell below 300 because of <strong>poaching</strong>, raising fears that the animals might go <strong>extinct</strong> in a country famous for its wildlife.</p>
<p>Kenya now has nearly 1,000 black rhinos, says the wildlife service. That is the third biggest black rhino population in the world behind South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>There are just 6,487 wild rhinos left in the world, says rhino conservation group Save The Rhino. All live in Africa.</p>
<p>Kenyan officials say they have relocated more than 150 rhinos in the last 10 years or so.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Kenya moved 11 rhinos from the capital, Nairobi, to another <strong>sanctuary</strong> in the south of the country. All died soon after arriving at the sanctuary. Ten of them died from <strong>stress</strong>, lack of water and starvation, which was worsened by salt poisoning as they struggled with saltier water in their new home, investigations found. The other rhino was attacked by a lion.</p>
<p>Some of the 21 rhinos in the latest relocation are from Nairobi National Park. They will make a 300-kilometer trip in the back of a truck to Loisaba. Others will come from parks closer to Loisaba.</p>
<p>Loisaba was once home to a healthy black rhino population before they were wiped out in that area 50 years ago, said Loisaba Conservancy CEO Tom Silvester.</p>
<p>Kenyan wildlife officials say the country is aiming to grow its black rhino population to about 2,000. They believe 2,000 would be the best number considering the space available for them in national and private parks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Thailand hopes to start producing lithium from a mine in its southwest in about two years, government and business officials say.<br/>
泰国政府和企业官员表示，泰国希望在大约两年内开始从西南部的一个矿场生产出锂。</p>
<p>The mine could help the country become a center for electric vehicle (EV) production.<br/>
该矿可以帮助该国成为电动汽车生产中心。</p>
<p>Lithium is a metal critical to EV battery production.<br/>
锂是生产电动汽车电池的关键金属。</p>
<p>Establishing lithium mines would put Thailand in a special position among major producers of the metal because the country is also developing an EV production industry. Chinese carmakers already promised to invest $1.44 billion in that industry in Thailand.<br/>
建立锂矿将使泰国在该金属的主要生产国中处于特殊地位，因为该国也在发展电动汽车生产行业。中国汽车制造商已经承诺在泰国向该行业投资14.4亿美元。</p>
<p>The Australian company Miner Pan Asia Metals is preparing to register for mining permits in March for the Reung Kiet project. The project is taking place in the country's Phang-Nga area. The property could also include the proposed Bang I Tum mine.<br/>
澳大利亚公司泛亚金属正准备在3月份为良杰项目注册采矿许可证。该项目正在泰国攀牙府进行。该项目还可能包括拟建的Bang I Tum矿场。</p>
<p>Pan Asia's leader Paul Lock told Reuters that the company is "optimistic" about starting lithium chemical production from Reung Kiet by early 2026.<br/>
泛亚金属董事长保罗 · 洛克对路透社表示，该公司对2026年初开始从良杰项目生产锂化工产品持“乐观”态度。</p>
<p>Thailand's Department of Primary Industries and Mines (DPIM) predicts that the Reung Kiet site could produce about 164,500 tonnes of the metal.<br/>
泰国初级工业和矿业部预测，良杰矿场可能生产约16.45万吨锂。</p>
<p>That would be enough to produce at least 1 million EV batteries of 50 kilowatt-hours, said DPIM Director General Aditad Vasinonta.<br/>
泰国基础工业和矿业部部长阿迪塔德·瓦西农塔表示，这将足以生产至少100万个容量为50千瓦时的电动汽车电池。</p>
<p>The official said mining could begin there in about two years.<br/>
这位官员说大约两年后那里就可以开始采矿了。</p>
<p>And, Pan Asia's Paul Lock says the mineral resources at Bang I Tum may be 10 to 70 percent larger than Reung Kiet.<br/>
泛亚金属的保罗 · 洛克表示，Bang I Tum矿场的矿产资源可能比良杰矿场高出10%到70%。</p>
<p>Experts do not know how much reachable lithium exists in Thailand. Major suppliers of the metal include Australia, Argentina, Chile, and China.<br/>
专家们不知道泰国有多少可开采的锂。该金属的主要供应商包括澳大利亚、阿根廷、智利和中国。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center of production<br/>
生产中心</span></p>
<p>Thailand is Southeast Asia's largest automobile producer and exporter. It wants EVs to account for 30 percent of its yearly automobile production by 2030.<br/>
泰国是东南亚最大的汽车生产国和出口国。它希望到2030年，电动汽车占其汽车年产量的30%。</p>
<p>Narit Therdsteerasukdi is Secretary General of the Thailand Board of Investment. He said the government has supported 38 battery production projects, including those for EV use, with total investment at $659.4 million.<br/>
纳立·特萨提拉沙是泰国投资委员会秘书长。他表示，政府已支持38个包括电动汽车用途的电池生产项目，总投资为6.594亿美元。</p>
<p>"Our goal is to push Thailand to become the regional hub for battery production, both for EV and for energy storage," he said.<br/>
他说：“我们的目标是推动泰国成为电动汽车和储能电池生产的区域中心。”</p>
<p>A regional hub is an important center of activity for a part of the world.<br/>
区域中心是全球部分地区的重要活动中心。</p>
<p>The Thai government is also pushing for lithium exploration in new areas. That includes changing laws to permit private companies to study agricultural lands, Aditad said.<br/>
泰国政府也在推动在新的地区进行锂勘探。阿迪塔德说，这包括修改法律，允许私营公司调查农业用地。</p>
<p>One of the interested companies is Matsa Resources, an Australian miner looking for lithium in Thailand.<br/>
澳大利亚矿业公司麦莎资源就是其中一家感兴趣的公司，该公司正在泰国寻找锂。</p>
<p>Matsa holds two special permits to look for lithium in Thailand. And it has over 100 requests waiting, it said in January.<br/>
麦莎资源持有两张在泰国寻找锂的特别许可证。该公司在1月份表示，目前有100多个申请在等待处理。</p>
<p>"They will be only one of a handful of countries that have got the whole supply chain from mining to production within the same country," said Paul Poli, Matsa's leader.<br/>
麦莎资源董事长保罗·波利表示：“泰国将是少数几个在国内拥有从采矿到生产的整个供应链的国家之一。”</p>
<p>The lithium under exploration in Thailand is found within a mineral known as lepidolite. It is more costly to process than the kind of lithium mined in Australia and Chile.<br/>
泰国正在勘探的锂是在一种被称为锂云母的矿物中发现的。它的加工成本比澳大利亚和智利开采的锂更高。</p>
<p>Matsa and Pan Asia said they are in discussions with Chinese companies to process the lepidolite mineral. Chinese companies have experience producing lithium from lepidolite in Jiangxi province.<br/>
麦莎资源和泛亚金属表示，他们正在与中国公司商讨加工锂云母矿。中国企业在江西省拥有利用锂云母生产锂的经验。</p>

            <title>Scientists Map Largest Deep-Sea Coral Reef off US Atlantic Coast  (2024/1/27)</title>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Scientists have mapped the largest <strong>coral reef</strong> off America's Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Researchers say the reef stretches about 500 kilometers from Florida to South Carolina. At some points, it is 109 kilometers wide. The researchers measured the reef using <strong>3D</strong> mapping technology.</p>
<p>"It's eye-opening – it's breathtaking in <strong>scale</strong>," Stuart Sandin told The Associated Press. He is a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Sandin was not included in the research.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this image provided by NOAA Ocean Exploration, an alfonsino fish swims on a cold water coral mound in the center of the Blake Plateau off the southeastern coast of the U.S., in June 2019.(NOAA Ocean Exploration via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-2072-08dc1c22603c_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this image provided by NOAA Ocean Exploration, an alfonsino fish swims on a cold water coral mound in the center of the Blake Plateau off the southeastern coast of the U.S., in June 2019.(NOAA Ocean Exploration via AP)</span></div>
<p>Ocean scientists have known since the 1960s that some coral life was present off the Atlantic Coast. But the reef's exact size had remained a mystery. New underwater mapping technology made it possible to construct images of the ocean floor in three dimensions.</p>
<p>The largest yet known deep coral reef "has been right under our noses, waiting to be discovered," said Derek Sowers. He is an oceanographer at the nonprofit group <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nautiluslive.org/">Ocean Exploration Trust</a>.</p>
<p>Sowers and other scientists recently released maps of the reef in the publication <em>Geomatics</em>.</p>
<p>The reef was found at ocean depths from 200 to 1,000 meters. Deep-sea life cannot use sunlight to carry out <strong>photosynthesis</strong>. Instead, reef corals at extreme depths must <strong>filter</strong> food particles out of the water for energy.</p>
<p>Deep coral reefs are known to contain animals such as sharks, swordfish, sea stars, octopus, shrimp and many kinds of fish.</p>
<p>Unlike deep coral reefs, tropical reefs are better known to scientists and sea explorers alike because they are easier to reach. The world's largest tropical coral reef system, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, stretches for 2,300 kilometers.</p>
<p>Sowers said it is possible larger deep-sea reefs will be discovered in the future since only about 25 percent of the world's ocean floor has been mapped in 3D. Only 50 percent of U.S. offshore waters have been mapped. Maps of the ocean floor are created using high-technology sound equipment, called sonar, on ships.</p>
<p>Erik Cordes is a marine biologist at Temple University and a co-writer of a study on the mapping operation. He said deep reefs cover more of the ocean floor than tropical reefs. But both are currently facing similar risks, including climate change and damage from oil and gas exploration activities</p>

<span class="byline">By Caty Weaver</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Tuesday announced the nominees for Hollywood's highest movie awards --- the Oscars. As usual, there were surprises. And there were snubs, meaning filmmakers or films that were rejected as candidates. Here are some of the facts about this year's nominees.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering the Oscars</strong></p>
<p>Actor Jodie Foster was nominated for her performance in a supporting role in the film <em>Nyad</em>. It is her fifth nomination. The first came 47 years ago when she was just 14 years old.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on February 21, 2015. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/23dac5d6-fa99-4d71-b4b5-25bc323a2275_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on February 21, 2015. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)</span></div>
<p>This year she returns as a nominee after an unusually long absence from the Oscars. Her last nomination was for <em>Nell</em> in 1995.</p>
<p>Foster has won two Academy Awards as a lead actor. Her first came in 1989 for the movie <em>The Accused</em>. She won again in 1992 for the film <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. Her costar in <em>Nyad</em>, Annette Bening, is also nominated for an Oscar in the best performance by a lead actress <strong>category</strong>. Like Foster, Bening has been nominated four other times. But she has yet to win any Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Foster has more nominations than the rest of the actors in her category combined. Emily Blunt, Danielle Brooks, America Ferrera and Da'Vine Joy Randolph are all first-time nominees.</p>
<p>Foster's <strong>gap</strong> between nominations is not a record, though. Last year, actor Judd Hirsch got his first nomination in 42 years for his performance in <em>The Fabelmans</em>.</p>
<p><strong>John Williams dials in on Disney with ‘destiny'</strong></p>
<p>Music writer, or composer, John Williams, is back in the running for an Oscar. The 91-year-old became on Tuesday the oldest nominee in history for his <strong>original score</strong> for <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>. Williams broke the age record of 90 set last year by nominee John Williams.</p>
<p>The composer has been nominated for 54 Academy Awards. He is the most Oscar-nominated living person. He needs six more to overtake Walt Disney's record of 59 nominations.</p>
<p>Williams has won five Oscars. His last was in 1994 for the score of <em>Schindler's List</em>, which also won the award for best picture.</p>
<p><strong>Women's films honored, women snubbed</strong></p>
<p>A record three films directed by women were nominated for best picture: <em>Barbie</em> from Greta Gerwig, <em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> from Justine Triet, and <em>Past Lives</em> from Celine Song.</p>
<p>But only one of them – Triet – received a best director nomination.</p>
<p>Gerwig's snub, along with <em>Barbie</em> star Margot Robbie's in the best actress category, were widely protested after the nominations were announced Tuesday. But each is still in the larger group of nominees. Robbie is a producer who will get an Oscar if <em>Barbie</em> wins best picture. And Gerwig is nominated for best adapted screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>The spirit of Spielberg and scores for Scorsese</strong></p>
<p>Director Steven Spielberg was a 2024 Oscar presence even on a year off. Spielberg did not direct a movie last year that met time limits for Academy Award consideration. However, he is nominated as a producer of the movie <em>Maestro</em>.</p>
<p>If it wins best picture, Spielberg will take home his fourth Oscar.</p>
<p>Martin Scorsese, meanwhile, broke Spielberg's record on director nominations. Scorsese is nominated this year for the movie <em>The Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.</p>

<p>Before the publication of the report, there were only general estimates about how many Holocaust survivors are still alive.</p>
<p>Their numbers are quickly falling. Most are very old and often in poor health, with a median age of 86. Twenty percent of survivors are older than 90, with more women (61 percent) than men (39 percent) still alive.</p>
<p>The report is called "Holocaust Survivors Worldwide. A Demographic Overview." It says 96 percent of survivors are "child survivors." That means they were born after 1928. Information in the report is based on numbers collected up until August 2023.</p>
<p>"The numbers in this report are interesting, but it is also important to look past the numbers to see the individuals they represent," said Greg Schneider. He is the Claims Conference's executive vice president.</p>
<p>Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their supporters during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>It is not clear exactly how many Jews survived the Holocaust. But their numbers were far smaller than the Jewish population in Europe before World War II. 3.3 million Jews lived in Poland in 1939. Only about 300,000 survived.</p>
<p>About 560,000 Jews lived in Germany in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power. At the end of World War II in 1945, their numbers had fallen to about 15,000 — through <strong>emigration</strong> and murder.</p>
<p>Germany's Jewish community grew after 1990. More than 215,000 Jewish migrants and their families moved to Germany from countries of the former Soviet Union. Some of them were also survivors. The report said that 14,200 survivors still live in Germany.</p>
<p>One of them is Ruth Winkelmann. She survived by hiding with her mother and sister in a garden <strong>shed</strong> in northern Berlin. Her father was killed in the Auschwitz death camp. Her younger sister Esther died of illness, hunger, and <strong>exhaustion</strong> in March 1945, just weeks before the Soviet Red Army entered Berlin.</p>
<p>Winkelmann is 95 and still lives in Berlin. She said there has not been a day in her life when she did not remember her father.</p>
<p>For its new report, the Claims Conference said it defined Holocaust survivors "based on agreements with the German government in assessing <strong>eligibility</strong> for <strong>compensation</strong> programs."</p>
<p>For Germany, that definition includes all Jews who lived in the country from January 30, 1933, when Hitler came to power, to May 1945. That is when Germany surrendered in World War II.</p>
<p>The group deals with claims for Jews who suffered under the Nazis and negotiates compensation with Germany's finance ministry every year. Since 1952, the German government has paid more than $90 billion to individuals for suffering and losses resulting from the Nazis.</p>
<p>The Claims Conference has also launched several educational projects to pass on survivors' stories to younger generations.</p>
<p>Gideon Taylor is president of the Claims Conference. He said the data the group gathered "not only tells us how many and where survivors are, it clearly indicates that most survivors are at a period of life where their need for care and services is growing."</p>
<p>"Now is the time to <strong>double down</strong> on our attention on this <strong>waning</strong> population. Now is when they need us the most."</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Bill in China about the word "as."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear VOA,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Meanings of 'as'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-6c54-08dc1db20f13_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Meanings of 'as'</span></div>
<p>Thank you for your high quality American English teaching!</p>
<p>The following sentence is from one of your recent news, and I can't understand <strong>a bit</strong> of it. Would you like to help me?</p>
<p><em>And the comedy "Poor Things" <strong>upset</strong> summer hit "Barbie," as Hollywood threw its biggest party since labor disputes shut down much of show business last year.</em></p>
<p>To be <strong>precise</strong>, I can't understand the part after "as Hollywood..."</p>
<p>I think "as Hollywood..." might be a reason to describe the part before.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Bill YANG from Beijing, China</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Bill. This is a very good question. The word "as" has many meanings and uses in English. In your example, "as" is a subordinator. Subordinators are used to join two <strong>clauses</strong> and add information.</p>
<p>In this sentence, "as" shows that the events were happening at the same time. The movie "Poor Things" upset the movie "Barbie" at the same time that Hollywood threw its biggest party. Both things happened at the Golden Globes earlier this month.</p>
<p>In addition to meaning "at the same time," "as" can be used to establish a reason.</p>
<p><em>I don't need to write it down, <u>as I trust myself</u>.</em></p>
<p>"I trust myself" is the reason I don't need to write it down.</p>
<p>"As" can also be used to point to the future. For example:</p>
<p><em><u>As you're coming to the station</u>, you'll see a pub in front of you.</em></p>
<p>In this sentence, "as" points to a future time.</p>
<p>"As" is often used as a subordinator in many longer phrases. These phrases include "as long as", "as soon as", "as far as".</p>
<p>There are many other ways to use "as" in a sentence. It can be a preposition, part of a prepositional verb, and used with adjectives or adverbs for comparison. But we can talk about those meanings another time.</p>
<p>We hope this explanation helps you understand the meaning of "as" in your example, Bill.</p>

            <title>Japan’s Moon Lander Hits Its Target  (2024/1/26)</title>

<p>Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said Thursday that its first lunar <strong>mission</strong> landed within 100 meters of its target over the weekend.</p>
<p>Japan became the fifth country to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the spacecraft's power system made it difficult to know whether it landed in the target area at first.</p>
<p>Earlier moon landers targeted landing areas as large as 10 kilometers. However, with its improved <strong>accuracy</strong>, Japan's SLIM aimed at a target area of just 100 meters.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) shows an image of a robotic moon rover called Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, on the moon. (JAXA/Takara Tomy/Sony Group Corporation/Doshisha University via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-17dc-08dc1dc790ed_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) shows an image of a robotic moon rover called Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, on the moon. (JAXA/Takara Tomy/Sony Group Corporation/Doshisha University via AP)</span></div>
<p>Shinichiro Sakai is JAXA's project leader for the lander. He said, "We proved that we can land wherever we want." Sakai hoped that it would bring more missions "to try to land on unexplored places on the moon."</p>
<p>One of the lander's two main engines stopped working during the landing, causing SLIM to move 55 meters away from the target area to another position, Sakai said. Without engine trouble, he said SLIM could have landed as close as three to four meters from the target. However, the spacecraft could not produce power after landing. JAXA scientists said its <strong>solar panels</strong> might be facing the wrong direction.</p>
<p>JAXA said it received all data about the touchdown within the two hours and 37 minutes before the lander lost power. Officials said there is still hope the craft will be able to <strong>recharge</strong> when that side of the moon enters daytime in the coming days.</p>
<p>The power outage meant the lander's camera could only capture low-<strong>resolution</strong> images, JAXA said.</p>
<p><strong>Moon sniper</strong></p>
<p>The goal of landing within a target area of less than 100 meters led scientists to call SLIM the "moon sniper."</p>
<p>It used "vision-based" guidance that JAXA says could be a powerful tool for future exploration of the moon's mountainous areas. These areas might hold resources of fuel, water and oxygen.</p>
<p>Japan follows the United States, the former Soviet Union, China and India as nations reaching the moon's surface. The mission was the result of 20 years of work on <strong>precision</strong> technology by JAXA.</p>
<p>JAXA has experience with difficult space landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long <strong>asteroid</strong> Ryugu. Hayabusa2 collected material that was returned to Earth for scientific research in 2020.</p>
<p>In the past year, three lunar missions have failed. One by Russia's space agency; one by a private Japanese company and another by a private U.S. company. However, more lunar landers will head to the moon this year.</p>
<p>U.S. company Intuitive Machines aims to launch its IM-1 lander in mid-February. China plans to send its Chang'e-6 spacecraft to the far side of the moon in the first half of the year. And the American space agency NASA is planning its lunar polar exploration rover VIPER for November.</p>

            <title>US Scientist’s Advice Shocks British Tea Drinkers  (2024/1/26)</title>

<p>An American scientist has started a <u>tempest in a teapot</u> by offering Britain advice on its favorite drink: tea.</p>
<p><u>Tempest in a teapot</u> is an expression to describe a strong, noisy, and angry reaction over something small or unimportant.</p>
<p>Michelle Francl is a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College, outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She said tea drinkers should add a little salt to make a perfect cup of tea.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A cup of black tea with a spoon and tea leaves in London, on Aug. 29, 2022.

An American scientist has started a tempest in a teapot by offering Britain advice on its favorite drink: tea. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)</span></div>
<p>That advice is included in her book <em>Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea</em>. The book was published Wednesday by the Royal Society of Chemistry.</p>
<p>Mixing tea with salt water has never gone well for British-American relations. In 1773, American colonists in Boston, Massachusetts, were angry at Britain for adding more taxes to raise money. So they dumped British tea into the sea. The event became known as the Boston Tea Party. It led to the start of the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Francl's suggestion caused <strong>outrage</strong> among tea lovers in Britain. They see Americans as coffee drinkers who know nothing about tea. And they think if Americans drink tea at all, they just heat water in a <strong>microwave</strong>.</p>
<p>"Don't even say the word ′salt′ to us..." said the <strong>etiquette</strong> guide Debrett's on the social media service X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>Even the U.S. Embassy in London joined the <u>tempest in a teapot</u>. In a social media post, it promised "the good people of the U.K. [United Kingdom] that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy."</p>
<p>"Let us unite in our steeped solidarity and show the world that when it comes to tea, we stand as one," the embassy said in the post. "The U.S. Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way - by microwaving it," it added.</p>
<p>The embassy later said that the post was "a <strong>lighthearted</strong> play on our shared cultural connections" rather than an official press release.</p>
<p>Francl's book <em>Steeped</em>, however, is no joke. The advice, its publisher said, comes from three years of research and experimentation with more than 100 chemical compounds. The book, the publisher added, "puts the chemistry to use with advice on how to brew a better cup."</p>
<p>Francl said adding a small amount of salt — not enough to taste — makes tea seem less <strong>bitter</strong>. This is because "the sodium ions in salt block the bitter receptors in our mouths," she explained.</p>
<p>She also suggests making tea in a warmed pot, shaking the tea bag around, and serving tea in a short and wide cup to keep the heat. And she says milk should be added to the cup after the tea and not before – another issue that often divides tea lovers.</p>
<p>Francl has been surprised by the reaction to her book in Britain.</p>
<p>"I kind of understood that there would hopefully be a lot of interest," she told <em>The Associated Press</em>. "I didn't know we'd <strong>wade</strong> into a diplomatic conversation with the U.S. Embassy."</p>

<p>Croatian artist Tomislav Horvat is not the first person to make models out of matchsticks, but he might be creating the largest projects.</p>
<p>A matchstick is the short, thin piece of wood that is used to make matches for lighting fire.</p>
<p>Horvat thinks nothing of using 210,000 matchsticks to create a life-size statue, or sculpture, of a musician<strong> </strong>playing on a large piano. The instrument even comes complete with matchstick <strong>strings</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Tomislav Horvat, 34, inspects a new sculpture of Michelangelo made of matches in Domasinec, Croatia, January 17, 2024.

<p>But that was not enough for the 34-year-old from the northern village of Domasinec. He is just a year and a half away from completing his version of Michelangelo's sculpture of David.</p>
<p>Michelangelo was a famous Italian artist who lived about 500 years ago. He created a famous marble sculpture of <em>The Bible's</em> King David that is in the city of Florence.</p>
<p>"I need another 30,000 matchsticks to finish it. That is, it'll need about 430,000 in total," he said. "I've been working on it for six years."</p>
<p>Horvat began making small models, but in 2013 he took on a larger project. He decided to create a life-size version of American actor Al Pacino as his celebrated <strong>character</strong> Don Corleone from Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film <em>The Godfather</em>.</p>
<p>Sculptures that size would collapse without a supporting structure. He creates this additional structure from a material called papier-m<i></i>226;ché or wood.</p>
<p>The Pianist<em> </em>is his second work that is of a large size. His third is Desperate Man, which is made of 54,000 matches and took a year and a half to make.</p>
<p>Horvat has shown his works in <strong>galleries</strong> in Croatia, including the capital Zagreb. But they are not, for now, available to buy.</p>

            <title>UN: Taliban Enforcing Restrictions on Single, Unaccompanied Women  (2024/1/26)</title>

<p>A report from the United Nations says the Taliban are putting more and more restrictions on women in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban re-took power in Afghanistan after the United States withdrew from the country in 2021. Taliban leaders said at the time they would permit women to be more involved in work, school and public life than during their previous rule, between 1996 and 2001.</p>
<p>However, the U.N. says the Taliban's Vice and Virtue Ministry is <strong>cracking down</strong> on single and unaccompanied women.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Afghan girls of all ages are permitted to study in religious schools, which are traditionally boys-only, a Taliban official said Thursday Dec. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/6067b961-83d7-4e99-8954-03c6d3d04739_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Afghan girls of all ages are permitted to study in religious schools, which are traditionally boys-only, a Taliban official said Thursday Dec. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File)</span></div>
<p>In one case, the U.N. notes, the ministry told a woman to get married if she wanted to continue working at a health clinic. The ministry said it was not right for an unmarried woman to have a job.</p>
<p>The restrictions follow a <strong>pattern</strong> of the Taliban breaking their 2021 promise that life in Afghanistan would be more open to women. Girls are not permitted to continue going to school after sixth grade, for example. Places that cut and <strong>style</strong> women's hair have been shut down. And women who are not wearing a hijab, the Islamic head covering, have been arrested.</p>
<p>In May of 2022, the Taliban said women should go back to wearing the religious clothing called a burqa. A burqa is a covering that only shows a woman's eyes.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s Assistance Mission in Afghanistan is reporting on the restrictions. The group's latest report centers on restrictions on women who leave home without a male guardian.</p>
<p>There are no official rules about women needing to be accompanied by a male relative. But the Taliban now say women are not permitted to travel a certain distance away from their home without a man who is either their husband or a relative.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s report said three female healthcare workers were held by police in October when they left home without a guardian. They were only released when their families signed a document saying it would not happen again.</p>
<p>In the Paktia province, the Vice and Virtue Ministry stopped women without guardians from entering health centers starting in December. The men from the ministry are now entering women's health centers to be sure that all women inside are with a male guardian.</p>
<p>The <strong>Vice</strong> and <strong>Virtue</strong> Ministry is also known as the Taliban's "<strong>morality</strong> police." Ministry workers have been going to bus stations, education centers and other public places to make sure women are following their rules. They are looking for women who are not wearing head coverings and stopping buses to make sure women are not traveling without a male family member.</p>
<p>Women are also being arrested for purchasing birth control, which the Taliban have not officially banned.</p>
<p>Zabihullah Mujahid is the spokesman for the Taliban. In a statement, he said the U.N. report is filled with misunderstandings. He said the U.N. is ignoring or criticizing Islamic law, known as Shariah.</p>
<p>Mujahid added that the Islamic government in power in Afghanistan must fully observe "all <strong>aspects</strong> of Sharia for both men and women."</p>

<p>Imagine you want to talk about the people in your country or in the world. In other words, you want to talk about a population.</p>
<p>How might you do so?</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore the noun "population." You will learn important ideas about the term and how to use it in everyday situations.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-396d-08dc1db9d60a_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Let's start with a visit to the <strong>dictionary</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Population vs. populate </strong></p>
<p>If you look in a dictionary, you might wonder about two words that seem closely related. We have the noun "population" and the verb "populate."</p>
<p>Is it important to know about the verb "populate," you might ask?</p>
<p>Google Ngram Viewer permits us to examine words and <strong>phrases </strong>in thousands of books. We can get a good idea of how often individual words and structures are used.</p>
<p>When we examine the frequency of "population" and compare it to that of "populate," we reach a clear finding: the noun "population" is much more commonly used.</p>
<p>Another way to understand the idea is this: you are much more likely to hear "population" in everyday situations.</p>
<p><strong>Countable noun </strong></p>
<p>Population is a noun meaning the number of people, animals, or other living things of a kind in an area.</p>
<p>We commonly use "population" as a countable noun. In other words, you can add an –s to the end of "population" to get the plural form "populations."</p>
<p>So, you might hear or read the singular form "population," as in:</p>
<p><em>Experts expect the world's population to increase by a very small amount over the next year. </em></p>
<p>We use the singular form because we are talking about all the people who live in the world – one very large group!</p>
<p>How might we use the plural form? In this case, we might use other terms to clarify that we are talking about different groups. For example, you might read or hear something like this:</p>
<p><em>Elderly and overweight populations face greater risk from the illness. </em></p>
<p>In this case, we use the plural form "populations" because we are talking about all of the members of two separate groups – elderly people and overweight people.</p>
<p>Now that we have explored the noun "population," we should consider the word in terms of broader language situations.</p>
<p><strong>Words before and after </strong></p>
<p>How do we commonly use the word "population" in everyday speech?</p>
<p>Let's start by examining the most commonly used words that come before and after "population."</p>
<p>Since "population" is a noun, we might expect that determiners – words that tell us if a noun is general or <strong>specific</strong> – should be commonly used before it.</p>
<p>Google's Ngram Viewer tell us that the word "the" is the most commonly used word before "population."</p>
<p>So, you are very likely to hear or read something like this:</p>
<p><em>Experts said the population declined by 1 percent. </em></p>
<p>And what about the most commonly used word after the noun "population?"</p>
<p>We find that the short word "of" is the most common by far.</p>
<p>So, you are very likely to hear or read something like this:</p>
<p><em>The population of Japan is aging quickly. </em></p>
<p><strong>Words connected to population </strong></p>
<p>Over and under are two words that can be attached to population to form a new single word.</p>
<p>Overpopulation describes a situation in which there are too many people.</p>
<p>Underpopulation describes a situation in which there are too few people.</p>
<p>Importantly, we generally use "overpopulation" and "underpopulation" as noncount nouns. In other words, there is no plural form. We do not add an –s to the end of either word.</p>
<p>How might you expect these terms to appear in everyday situations? Here are two examples:</p>
<p><em>Experts predict overpopulation will result in food shortages. </em></p>
<p><em>Experts predict underpopulation will result in labor shortages. </em></p>
<p><strong>Questions </strong></p>
<p>In today's lesson, we explored a useful noun and how to use it in everyday situations.</p>
<p>We will close our lesson with a call to action. Please answer the following questions in an email to <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com" target="_blank">learningenglish@voanews.com</a></p>
<p>What is the population like in your country or city? Is the population increasing or decreasing?</p>
<p>In a future lesson, we can provide feedback on some of the writing that we receive.</p>

            <title>‘Deepfake’ of Biden’s Voice Called Early Example of US Election Disinformation  (2024/1/25)</title>

<span class="datetime">24 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A <strong>fake</strong> voice message claiming to be U.S. President Joe Biden was recently sent to voters in an example of possible election disinformation.</p>
<p>The voice message is an example of what is known as a "deepfake." A "deepfake" is a piece of audio or video created to make it appear that people in it are saying or doing things that they never did. Newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) tools make it easier for people to make and publish such content.</p>
<p>The fake voice of Biden was included in a political message sent by telephone directly to voters in the northeastern state of New Hampshire. This marketing method, known as "robocalling," involves a machine that calls large numbers of people to play them a prerecorded message.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, U.S. President Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House, on January 19, 2024,. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-24ce-08dc1cfcbf42_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, U.S. President Joe Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House, on January 19, 2024,. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)</span></div>
<p>The calls are being investigated by New Hampshire election officials. The state recently held America's first presidential primary contest. Primary elections in the United States usually choose the candidates for the presidential election in November.</p>
<p>It is not known who created the fake audio, which was heard by reporters from several news organizations. In it, Biden seems to try to persuade voters not to take part in the primary.</p>
<p>The voice says, "Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their <strong>quest</strong> to elect Donald Trump again." The message continues, "Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday."</p>
<p>Voting in state primaries does not affect a person's vote later in the U.S. presidential election, which is set for November 5, 2024.</p>
<p>The Biden robocalls even included language the U.S. president has often used in the past, specifically the phrase, "What a bunch of malarkey." The phrase is used to describe something foolish, unreasonable or meaningless. The phone message advises listeners to "save your vote for the November election."</p>
<p>It is not known how many people received the call with Biden's voice. Biden did not campaign in New Hampshire and his name was not on the state's primary ballot. This is because his campaign decided to begin the primary process in the state of South Carolina instead. However, a New Hampshire state law requires it to hold the nation's first primary.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the call was "fake and not recorded by the president." The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was not involved with the call.</p>
<p>The head of Biden's re-election campaign, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement the organization was investigating the incident and "actively discussing additional actions to take." Rodriguez said the robocall was a clear attempt "to suppress voting and <strong>deliberately undermine</strong> free and fair elections."</p>
<p>Robert Weissman is head of the nonprofit citizen activist group Public Citizen. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.citizen.org/news/new-hampshire-deepfake-of-biden-shows-danger-of-ai-in-elections/">said</a> in a statement the Biden robocall provided fresh evidence that "the political deepfake moment is here." He urged governments to consider passing legislation to limit the use of deepfakes to prevent election "<strong>chaos</strong>."</p>
<p>Deepfakes created with AI technology have already appeared in campaign advertisements in the 2024 presidential race, the Associated Press (AP) reports. The technology has also been used to spread false information during election campaigns across the world, from Slovakia to Indonesia to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Hany Farid is a digital investigations expert at the University of California, Berkeley. He told the AP the Biden robocall demonstrates how AI methods can be "weaponized" in elections. Farid added that recent cases of audio and video used to mislead voters "is surely a sign of things to come."</p>
<p>As AI technologies improve, governments around the world are seeking ways to restrict them from causing public harm. The U.S. Congress has yet to pass legislation to limit the use of such technologies in the political process. The Federal Election Commission is currently considering public comments on a <strong>petition</strong> for it to restrict AI-created deepfakes in campaign advertisements.</p>
<p>David Becker heads the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research. He told the AP the use of deepfakes is just the latest tool in a long history of "dirty tricks" aimed at influencing the political process.</p>
<p>Becker added that the goal of such efforts can be to <strong>confuse</strong> voters to a point where they no longer recognize false information from the truth. "They don't need to <strong>convince</strong> us that what they're saying, the lies they're telling us, are true," he said. "They just need to convince us that there is no truth, that you can't believe anything you're told."</p>

<span class="datetime">24 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A World Health Organization (WHO) official who recently returned from the Gaza Strip said recently that the health care system is collapsing. He said more workers and supplies are needed.</p>
<p>WHO Health Emergency Officer Sean Casey told reporters at the United Nations: "I've seen the health care system collapsing before my eyes."</p>
<p>Casey spent five weeks in Gaza, starting in early December. While there, he met with medical professionals and patients across the territory.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - People inspect the damage in a room following Israeli bombardment at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Dec. 17, 2023. (AFP Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-55bb-08dc00cfb7e0_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - People inspect the damage in a room following Israeli bombardment at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Dec. 17, 2023. (AFP Photo)</span></div>
<p>"I saw patients in hospitals every day with severe burns, with open <strong>fractures</strong>, waiting hours or days for care, and they would often ask me for food and water," he said.</p>
<p>Casey said a cease-fire is needed. But he also said the ability to move people and aid supplies safely and quickly within Gaza would help ease suffering.</p>
<p>Reports say Gaza had a strong health care system with 36 hospitals and 25,000 doctors, nurses and specialists before Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7. Now, the WHO says, about 15 hospitals are partially operating. That makes getting care difficult for the more than 50,000 injured people.</p>
<p>Casey said there is a shortage of supplies but also of workers. Many of them are displaced and struggling to survive and care for their own families.</p>
<p>"There are unbelievably brave health workers across Gaza who are staying and taking care of people because there is no one else to do it," he said.</p>
<p>Casey was in Gaza to see how to bring in more international medical teams.</p>
<p>He said getting supplies to northern Gaza is especially difficult. During the five weeks that he was there, his team was unable to provide supplies to the largest hospital in the north, al-Shifa, for 12 straight days.</p>
<p>At Al-Ahli hospital, also in the north, Casey said the situation was very bad.</p>
<p>"I saw patients who were lying on church <strong>pews</strong>, basically waiting to die in a hospital that had no fuel, no power, no water, very little in the way of medical supplies," he said.</p>
<p>Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid supplies. Casey said he had not seen evidence of that during his hospital visits.</p>
<p>"I have no evidence of supplies that have been delivered to hospitals going anywhere except to those hospitals," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Seema Jilani is an emergency health expert with the International Rescue Committee. She returned recently from a two-week visit to Gaza with five British doctors.</p>
<p>Jilani is a children's doctor who has worked in conflict areas including Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon. She said, "In my experience of working in conflict <strong>zones</strong> around the world, this is the most extreme situation I have seen in terms of <strong>scale</strong>, severity of injuries, number of children that have suffered that have nothing to do with any of this."</p>
<p>Jilani worked in the emergency room at Al-Aksa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, the only hospital in the middle area of Gaza. Jilani said she treated children who had lost arms and legs and who had extreme burns.</p>
<p>After she left, Jilani said, the hospital ran out of fuel and the lights went out. She does not know what has happened to the babies she treated or whether they have been moved to a safer place.</p>

            <title>Americans Begin to Feel Better about Economy as Inflation Slows  (2024/1/25) | 美国通胀放缓 美国人对经济感受改善</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202401/americans-begin-to-feel-better-about-economy-as-inflation-slows.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>Life is still more costly in the United States than it was about two years ago. But new research shows Americans are starting to feel better about the economy.<br/>
美国的生活成本仍然比两年前更高。但新的研究表明，美国人对经济的感觉开始好转。</p>
<p>An opinion study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans are increasingly hopeful that the inflation rate will continue to go down. The survey also found that the number of Americans who expect their financial situation to improve within the next year is at its highest since June 2021.<br/>
纽约联邦储备银行的一项民意研究发现，美国人越来越希望通货膨胀率会继续下降。调查还发现，预计明年财务状况会改善的美国人人数达到2021年6月以来的最高水平。</p>
<p>In addition, the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers recently reported the largest two-month jump in consumer sentiment since 1991. Consumer sentiment is a measure of how optimistic consumers feel about the economy.<br/>
此外，密歇根大学的消费者调查最近报告了自1991年以来消费者信心两个月来的最大增幅。消费者信心是衡量消费者对经济乐观程度的指标。</p>
<p>That optimism is balanced, however, by the fact that most Americans remember paying much less for daily purchases such as fuel and food only two or three years ago.<br/>
然而，这种乐观情绪是保持平衡的，因为大多数美国人记得，仅仅两三年前，他们为燃料和食品等日常购买支付的费用要少得多。</p>
<p>Many food items such as bread, milk and chicken are more costly than they were in February 2021. But economists say price increases have slowed significantly in the last year. At the same time, Americans are seeing pay increases higher than the rate of inflation.<br/>
面包、牛奶和鸡肉等许多食品的价格比2021年2月更高。但经济学家表示，去年物价上涨明显放缓。与此同时，美国人的工资增长率高于通货膨胀率。</p>
<p>The inflation rate was about 9 percent in June 2022. Today, the rate is 3.4 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve would like to see the rate at only 2 percent.<br/>
2022年6月的通货膨胀率约为9%。如今，这一比例为3.4%。美国联邦储备委员会希望其仅为2%。</p>
<p>Grace Zwemmer is an analyst at Oxford Economics. She said it took some time for Americans to feel the effects of falling inflation. But, she said, "it appears the good news is finally getting through."<br/>
格蕾丝·泽韦梅尔是牛津经济研究院的分析师。她说，美国人需要一段时间才能感受到通胀下降的影响。但是，她说，“看来好消息终于传来了。”</p>
<p>Political observers wonder if the change in feelings about the economy will help U.S. President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. Will people feel the drop in inflation or will they still remember that prices are much higher than they were two or three years ago?<br/>
政治观察家们想知道，对经济感受的改变是否有助于美国总统乔·拜登的连任竞选。人们会感觉到通货膨胀的下降吗？还是他们还记得物价比两三年前高得多？</p>
<p>Ryan Cummings is an economist who studies how politics affect consumer confidence. He said many Americans today base their feelings about the economy on what they hear from the politicians they support.<br/>
瑞安·卡明斯是一位研究政治如何影响消费者信心的经济学家。他说，今天许多美国人对经济的感受是基于他们所支持的政客讲述的。</p>
<p>Cummings said Republicans are likely to speak negatively about the economic performance during Biden's presidency, even as Democrats speak of the economic gains.<br/>
卡明斯表示，共和党人可能会对拜登总统任期内的经济表现持负面看法，即使民主党人提到经济收益。</p>
<p>The University of Michigan research shows consumer sentiment among Democrats jumped almost 12 percent in January. That is the second-highest increase ever.<br/>
密歇根大学的研究显示，1月份民主党人的消费者信心上升了近12%。这是有史以来第二高的增幅。</p>
<p>Many Americans say they want to see the government take steps to bring the prices of food, oil and meat back to where they were in 2020 or 2021. But economic experts say that is not a good idea. The moves that would be required to make that happen would hurt the economy overall. Taxes could increase and jobs would be lost.<br/>
许多美国人表示，他们希望看到政府采取措施，将食品、石油和肉类价格恢复到2020年或2021年的水平。但经济专家表示，这不是一个好主意。实现这一目标所需的举措将损害整体经济。税收可能会增加，工作岗位可能会流失。</p>
<p>David Andolfatto is an economist at the University of Miami. He used to work for the Federal Reserve. He said the better idea for Americans is to "just move ahead." He explained that while the cost of living is higher than it was two or three years ago, many Americans are making more money than they were then.<br/>
大卫·安迪亚法度是迈阿密大学的经济学家。他曾经在美联储工作。他说，对美国人来说，更好的想法是“向前看”。他解释说，虽然生活成本比两三年前更高，但许多美国人赚的钱也比当时更多。</p>
<p>"There's no need for (the government) to bring the price level back down. It would be too painful," Andolfatto said.<br/>
安迪亚法度说：“（政府）没有必要让物价水平回落。这会太痛苦了。”</p>
<p>Claudia Sahm is another former Federal Reserve economist. She added that "people are angry" because they cannot afford the cost increases.<br/>
克劳迪娅·萨姆是另一位前美联储经济学家。她补充说，“人们很生气”，因为他们负担不起成本增加。</p>
<p>"Can you afford it?" she asked. "Not everybody can say yes to that question. But over time, more and more people will be able to say yes."<br/>
她问道：“你负担得起吗？不是每个人都能对这个问题说是。但随着时间的推移，越来越多的人会有底气说是。”</p>

<span class="datetime">24 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A nonprofit group called Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is again bringing attention to crises around the world with its "<strong>Doomsday</strong> Clock."</p>
<p>The group describes the Doomsday Clock as a measure of the risk of worldwide disaster. On Tuesday, the group kept its "clock" set at 90 seconds to midnight, the same position as last year. The group noted Russia's nuclear weapons activities during the Ukraine war, nuclear-armed Israel's war in Gaza and climate change.</p>
<p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists considers midnight to be the point of total world destruction. The group says its clock is based on "<strong>existential</strong>" risks to Earth and its people. Those includes nuclear threats, climate change and technologies like artificial intelligence and new biotechnology.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rescuers work at a site of a residential building heavily damaged during a Russian missile attack, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kharkiv, Ukraine January 23, 2024.

(REUTERS/Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy)</span></div>
<p>Rachel Bronson is the Bulletin's president and CEO. She told Reuters news service that keeping the clock unchanged from the year earlier does not mean that the world is <strong>stable</strong>.</p>
<p>The group said on Tuesday that dangerous <strong>trends</strong> continue to point toward disaster. China, Russia, and the United States are all modernizing their nuclear weapons. The group said that increases the risk of a nuclear war through a mistake or misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine began nearly two years ago and has increased tensions with the West to their highest levels since the Cold War. An "end to Russia's war in Ukraine seems distant, and the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in that conflict remains a serious possibility. In the past year Russia has sent numerous worrying nuclear signals," Bronson said.</p>
<p>Bronson noted Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2023 decision to suspend Russian involvement in the New START treaty with the United States. That treaty limited the nuclear supplies of the two countries. The United States and Russia together hold almost 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Bronson also noted Putin's March decision to send nuclear weapons to Belarus and the Russian withdrawal of approval for a treaty banning nuclear tests. Russian expert Sergei Karaganov last year supported threatening to carry out nuclear strikes in Europe to frighten Russia's enemies.</p>
<p>Alexander Glaser of Princeton University is a member of the group's board of experts on nuclear technology and climate science.</p>
<p>"The picture is quite <strong>bleak</strong> on the nuclear side this year," he said.</p>
<p>Nuclear-armed Israel has been at war with Hamas since the Palestinian Islamist group, based in Gaza, launched attacks in southern Israel in October 2023. Bronson said the conflict risks becoming a big war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Climate change was added as an issue affecting the clock in 2007. Bronson noted that 2023 was the hottest year on record since satellite measurement of temperatures started in 1979. She also said <strong>fossil fuel</strong> <strong>emissions</strong> continue to rise.</p>
<p>Bronson said that 2023 was a record-breaking year for clean energy with $1.7 trillion in new investments. But fossil fuel investments also totaled nearly $1 trillion. Bronson called current efforts to reduce <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> emissions not enough. She said the results of climate change "<strong>disproportionately</strong> affect the poorest people in the world."</p>
<p>The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 at the beginning of the Cold War. The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by a group including scientists Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer.</p>

<p>It has become easy for students to find and copy published material. But copying another person's writing without giving them credit can get students and other scholars into big trouble. Copying another person's writing without crediting them is called plagiarism.</p>
<p>Recently, the leader of Harvard University stepped down over problems related to the use of other peoples' work in her writing.</p>
<p>American <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/">copyright law</a> protects <strong>original</strong> works of <strong>authorship</strong> including books, movies, music, images and artworks. The protection extends to computer software and the design of buildings and structures.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this Aug. 13, 2019 file photo, students walk near the Widener Library in Harvard Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.

</span></div>
<p>The owner can sell a copyright or permit others to use it because it is property and property ownership is protected by law in the U.S.</p>
<p>The idea is that copyright helps society. If people can gain from their own creations, called their intellectual property, then more people will want to create original works.</p>
<p>The law, however, permits the unlicensed use of copyrighted works under what is called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">fair use</a>. Fair use can include criticism, comment, news reporting, education and research. However, there are some limitations.</p>
<p>In education, students can include small parts of copyrighted work in their writing and research. But they must provide credit to the original creators through a citation which gives details about the <strong>source</strong>.</p>
<p>Many universities, including Harvard University, even urge students to give credit to sources of ideas when they come from discussions with professors or other students. Harvard even warns students about copying themselves. That is, they cannot hand in the same work for more than one class without the permission of their instructors.</p>
<p>A failure to do so is considered plagiarizing.</p>
<p><strong>How can professors know if a student is plagiarizing?</strong></p>
<p>Just as it is easy to copy, it is also easy for professors to know if a student has plagiarized.</p>
<p>First, there are computer programs and artificial intelligence, or AI, tools that compare students' papers to large databases of published writing. The programs can identify whether students have copied published writing. Second, if English is not a student's first language, a professor might recognize a change in wording and writing <strong>style</strong>. This could bring more attention to the student's paper.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is punished in different ways. Professors could simply warn a student not to do it again, lower their <strong>grade</strong>, or they might fail the student in that class. In more extreme cases, a student may be temporarily banned or expelled from school.</p>
<p><strong>Tools to avoid plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>There are free tools to make citations easier for students and to avoid plagiarism. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is a free, open-source program that helps organize all the research a student may use. For example, it can automatically create citations and combine them into a list. The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html">Purdue Online Writing Lab</a>, or Purdue OWL for short, is another free resource.</p>
<p>Many universities also have writing centers where students can learn the citation rules. And another way for students to learn how to avoid plagiarism is to read published papers and pay careful attention to how information is presented. Students should observe when and how citations are used. This can help them learn the rules of citations.</p>
<p>In educational, or academic, writing, it is better to cite too much than too little.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong>A possible double standard</strong></p>
<p>Harvard's Claudine Gay resigned this month after several accusations of plagiarism in her <strong>academic</strong> work.</p>
<p>Gay's academic writing got attention after she was strongly criticized for her answers to a Congressional committee related to freedom of speech. Critics found several cases of possible plagiarism in her 1997 doctoral paper. Harvard's governing board first supported Gay, saying a review of her scholarly work turned up "a few instances of <strong>inadequate</strong> citation" but no evidence of research wrongdoing.</p>
<p>There has been debate among academics over whether her conduct amounted to academic dishonesty. D. Stephen Voss is an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky. He knew Gay when they were graduate students at Harvard. A paper he co-wrote in the 1990s was one Gay is accused of plagiarizing from.</p>
<p>He said in an <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-some-academics-are-reluctant-to-call-claudine-gay-a-plagiarist">interview</a> with the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine that Gay did plagiarize from him. But what she copied from his paper was "<strong>trivial</strong>" and "<strong>inconsequential</strong>."</p>
<p>What Gay used from his paper "did not take an idea of any <strong>significance</strong> from my work." He added: "the bit she used from us was not in any way a major component of what made her research important or valuable."</p>
<p>Roger Kreuz is a psychology professor at the University of Memphis who is writing a book on the history and psychology of plagiarism. He told VOA in an email that if plagiarism is defined as taking words from another person's work, "the opinion of (Voss) doesn't really matter."</p>
<p>Kreuz wrote in the online publication, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://theconversation.com/plagiarism-is-not-always-easy-to-define-or-detect-220592">The Conversation</a>, that university students and professors might face different requirements when it comes to plagiarism. Kreuz wrote that professors suspected of plagiarism may be given the <strong>benefit of the doubt</strong> by their schools. They may also be given the chance to make corrections to their published work.</p>
<p>Kreuz added that university leaders think that <strong>faculty</strong> members know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it. If a problem arises, administrators might think they were just being careless with their citations or use of quotation marks.</p>
<p>Students, on the other hand, must follow university policies on academic behavior. Harvard, for example, warns that students may be forced to leave the college if they plagiarize. Work written by students is more likely to be closely examined and put through tools that identify plagiarism than faculty work.</p>
<p>Many students consider this a <strong>double standard</strong>.</p>
<p>Kreuz wrote in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/15/opinion/plagiarism-university-policies-faculty-harvard-claudine-gay/">an opinion piece</a> in <em>The Boston Globe</em> that university plagiarism policies for faculty are unclear.</p>
<p>How "can academics set or enforce policies for faculty when the concept is so ill-defined?" he asked.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>Oppenheimer, the film about the lead scientist in the American project to create a nuclear weapon, led the Academy Awards, or Oscars, with 13 nominations on Tuesday.<br/>
《奥本海默》是一部关于美国制造核武器项目首席科学家的电影，周二该电影以13项提名领跑奥斯卡奖。</p>
<p>The three-hour film was expected to be a top candidate for best picture. Oppenheimer also received nominations for best director for Christopher Nolan, lead actor for Cillian Murphy and supporting actors for Emily Blunt and Robert Downey, Jr. The film also received nominations for several production categories such as film editing and sound.<br/>
这部三小时的影片有望成为最佳影片的头号候选。《奥本海默》的克里斯托弗·诺兰获得最佳导演提名，西里安·墨菲获得男主角提名，艾米丽·布朗特和小罗伯特·唐尼获得男配角提名。该片还获得了电影剪辑和配乐等多个制作类别的提名。</p>
<p>Nolan is known as one of the top directors working in Hollywood today, but he has never won the award for director. None of his movies have won best picture. Experts say this may be his year to win both awards.<br/>
诺兰被称为当今好莱坞最顶尖的导演之一，但他从未获得过最佳导演奖。他的电影也从未获得最佳影片奖。专家表示，今年可能是他包揽两项大奖的一年。</p>
<p>Nolan told the Associated Press, "... getting this kind of recognition from the academy, I don't know what to say, really. It certainly confirms our faith in what studio filmmaking can be."<br/>
诺兰告诉美联社，“……得到学院的这种认可，我真的不知道该说什么。这肯定证实了我们对片厂电影制作的信念。”</p>
<p>Nine other films were nominated for best picture this year. They are Barbie, Poor Things, Killers of the Flower Moon, The Holdovers, Maestro, American Fiction, Past Lives, Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest.<br/>
今年还有9部电影获得最佳影片提名。它们是《芭比》、《可怜的东西》、《花月杀手》、《留校联盟》、《音乐大师》、《美国小说》、《过往人生》、《坠落的审判》和《利益区域》。</p>
<p>After Oppenheimer, the films with the most nominations were Poor Things with 11 and Killers of the Flower Moon with 10.<br/>
在《奥本海默》之后，获得提名最多的电影是《可怜的东西》（11项）和《花月杀手》（10项）。</p>
<p>Poor Things is a film about a Victorian-era woman brought back to life by a scientist and stars Emma Stone. She was nominated for best actress, along with Annette Bening in Nyad, Lily Gladstone in Killers of the Flower Moon, Sandra Huller in Anatomy of a Fall and Carey Mulligan in Maestro.<br/>
《可怜的东西》是一部关于一位维多利亚时代的女性的电影，这位女性由一位科学家复活，并由艾玛·斯通主演。斯通与《奈德》中的安妮特·贝宁、《花月杀手》中的莉莉·格莱斯顿、《坠落的审判》中的桑德拉·惠勒和《音乐大师》中的凯莉·穆里根一起获得了最佳女主角提名。</p>
<p>Barbie was the most successful movie in 2023. Greta Gerwig's film based on the famous toy brought in over $1.4 billion around the world. It received eight nominations. Gerwig, however, was not nominated for best director.<br/>
《芭比》是2023年最成功的电影。格蕾塔·葛维格根据这个著名玩偶拍摄的电影在全球带来了超过14亿美元的收入。它获得了八项提名。然而，葛维格并没有获得最佳导演提名。</p>
<p>Barbie received nominations for best picture, best supporting actor (Ryan Gosling as Ken) and two nominations for best song.<br/>
芭比娃娃获得了最佳影片、最佳男配角提名（瑞安·高斯林饰演肯）和两项最佳歌曲的提名。</p>
<p>The best director nominees were Nolan, Justine Triet of Anatomy of a Fall, Martin Scorsese of Killers of the Flower Moon, Yorgos Lanthimos of Poor Things and Jonathan Glazer of Zone of Interest. Scorsese was nominated in the category for the 10th time.<br/>
最佳导演提名者是诺兰、《坠落的审判》的茹斯汀·特里耶、《花月杀手》的马丁·斯科塞斯、《穷东西》的欧格斯·兰斯莫斯和《利益区域》的乔纳森·格雷泽。斯科塞斯是第10次获得该奖项提名。</p>
<p>The nominees for best international film were Society of the Snow, (from Spain); The Zone of Interest, (from Great Britain); The Teachers' Lounge (from Germany); Io Capitano (of Italy); and Perfect Days (from Japan).<br/>
最佳国际影片的提名者是来自西班牙的《绝境盟约》、来自英国的《利益区域》、来自德国《教师休息室》、来自意大利的《我是船长》和来自日本的《完美的日子》。</p>
<p>Experts say this year's group of nominees reflects a return to the traditional idea that films should be shown first in movie theaters before going to streaming services such as Netflix, Apple TV+ or Amazon Prime Video.<br/>
专家表示，今年的提名电影群体反映了对传统观念的回归，即电影应该先在电影院上映，然后再到Netflix、Apple TV+或亚马逊Prime Video等流媒体服务。</p>
<p>All of the top films spent at least one month in movie theaters first. Netflix was the top streaming video service with 18 nominations led by its film Maestro. That film tells the story of American composer Leonard Bernstein, and it stars actor Bradley Cooper, who also wrote and directed the movie.<br/>
所有顶级电影都会先在影院上映至少一个月。Netflix凭借其电影《音乐大师》等电影获得18项提名，位居流媒体视频服务榜首。这部电影讲述了美国作曲家伦纳德·伯恩斯坦的故事，主角布拉德利·库珀也是这部电影的编剧和导演。</p>
<p>The host of the awards broadcast on March 10 will be American late-night television presenter Jimmy Kimmel.<br/>
3月10日举行的颁奖典礼将由美国午夜电视节目主持人吉米·金梅尔主持。</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Across the north-central United States, <strong>weeds </strong>that resist control efforts are worrying farmers. This development is the latest sign that weeds are becoming resistant to chemicals faster than major companies can make new weed-fighting products.</p>
<p>Scientists say that some sorts of weeds are developing resistance to chemicals used to destroy them.</p>
<p>Reuters news agency recently spoke with more than 20 farmers, scientists, weed specialists and company leaders. The news agency also studied eight research papers published since 2021. The studies described how weeds, including kochia, waterhemp, and giant ragweed, are affecting crops in North Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Kochia is seen in a sugar beet field near Nampa, Idaho, U.S., May 24, 2018 .

(Clarke Alder/ Amalgamated Sugar Company/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>Over the last 20 years, chemical companies have reduced the percentage of revenue meant for research and development spending. These companies are also introducing fewer products, says AgbioInvestor, a company based in Britain that studies the agricultural chemical industry.</p>
<p>Farmers say their battle with weeds threatens grain and oilseed harvests at a time when growers face inflation and extreme weather.</p>
<p>"We're in for big problems over the next 10 years for sure," said Ian Heap of the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds. It is a group of international scientists who work with governments and industry. He added, "We are in for a real <strong>shake-up</strong>."</p>
<p>The research group has a database of information on the reduced effectiveness of glyphosate, one of the most common weed-killing chemicals, against 361 weed species, including 180 in the U.S.</p>
<p>These weeds affect corn, soy, sugar beets and other crops.</p>
<p>Around the world, 21 weeds globally showed resistance to dicamba, the most recent major U.S. chemical, which launched in 2017.</p>
<p>Environmental groups argue that farmers should embrace natural weed-control methods instead of chemicals.</p>
<p>One Kochia plant can spread as many as 30,000 seeds. It can result in <strong>yields</strong> reduced by up to 70 percent if nothing is done to stop it. That information comes from Take Action, a farmer resource program of the United Soybean Board.</p>
<p>Other issues, including the development of stronger seeds, have pushed overall crop yields higher around the world. But scientists expect weed problems to worsen. Some weeds are even showing resistance the first time they are treated with chemicals.</p>
<p>In Douglas, North Dakota, farmer Bob Finken used dicamba and glyphosate to kill weeds late in the growing season. Neither product completely killed kochia.</p>
<p>"That was really scary," said Finken, age 64. "Each year seems to get a little worse."</p>
<p>Finken had to clear the weeds with harvesting equipment, which risks damaging the machinery.</p>
<p>Other farmers are hiring workers to pull weeds by hand, said Sarah Lovas of GK Technology, an agriculture company.</p>
<p>North Dakota was the largest spring wheat producing state in 2023 and ninth-biggest soybean grower.</p>
<p>Five of North Dakota's 53 counties have confirmed populations of dicamba-resistant kochia. That is only one year after it was first reported in the state, said Joe Ikley of North Dakota State University.</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of time before it hits your farm," said 65-year-old Monte Peterson who grows soybeans near Valley City, North Dakota.</p>
<p>Chemical producers Bayer, Corteva and FMC say longer development and government approval processes have limited new products to combat weed resistance. Industry leaders also say officials have become stricter about possible environmental and health effects.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said <strong>standards</strong> for approving new herbicides have not changed greatly since 1996. However, the EPA said recent efforts to study the effects of new active ingredients on threatened plants and wildlife have delayed some decisions.</p>
<p>The EPA did not estimate the increased processing time. The agency said it speeds up studies of lower-risk products.</p>

            <title>Cameroon Launches First Malaria Vaccine Program for Children  (2024/1/23)</title>

<span class="datetime">22 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Cameroon has begun the world's first major malaria vaccine program for children.</p>
<p>The campaign launched Monday in the Central African nation. Health officials called the effort a major step in the fight against the disease across Africa. The continent accounts for about 95 percent of the world's malaria deaths.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the disease, which is spread through mosquitos, kills more than 600,000 people a year. Most of the deaths involve young children.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A nurse administers a malaria vaccine to an infant at the health center in Datcheka, Cameroon January 22, 2024.

(REUTERS/Desire Danga Essigue)</span></div>
<p>The vaccine, called RTS.S, was developed by British drug company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). It is meant to work with other preventive measures, such as the use of <strong>bed nets</strong>, to fight the disease.</p>
<p>Cameroon is the first country to offer vaccine injections through a <strong>routine</strong> program after successful tests, or trials, were carried out in Ghana and Kenya. Cameroon hopes to vaccinate about 250,000 children this year and next.</p>
<p>The international vaccine alliance called Gavi has said 19 other countries aim to launch their own campaigns this year. About 6.6 million children in those countries are to receive malaria vaccinations in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>"For a long time, we have been waiting for a day like this," said Mohammed Abdulaziz. He is with the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abdulaziz spoke during a joint news briefing with the WHO, Gavi and other organizations.</p>
<p>Cameroon is using one of two recently approved malaria vaccines, called Mosquirix. When the WHO approved the vaccine two years ago, officials admitted it was not perfect. But they noted its use could sharply reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The GSK-produced shot is only about 30 percent effective. It requires four shots, or doses. Tests have shown the vaccine's protection begins to weaken after several months. GSK has said it can only produce about 15 million doses of Mosquirix a year.</p>
<p>Some experts believe a second malaria vaccine developed by Oxford University and approved by the WHO in October may be a better solution. That vaccine, called R21, is less costly and only requires three doses.</p>
<p>Launching the second vaccine is expected to result in enough vaccine supply "to meet the high demand and reach millions more children," said Kate O'Brien. She is the WHO's director of vaccinations.</p>
<p>"Having two vaccines for malaria will help to close the huge <strong>gap</strong> between demand and supply and could save tens of thousands of young lives, especially in Africa," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p>
<p>India's Serum Institute – which helped develop the R21 vaccine –has said it could produce up to 200 million doses of it a year. Gavi has said that vaccine could be launched in May or June.</p>
<p>Some experts have raised questions about the long-term effectiveness of the vaccines. They have questioned whether attention and financing should be drawn away from the wider fight against the disease using established prevention methods.</p>
<p>But health experts at the news conference said the new vaccine launch included community efforts aimed at supporting the campaign. Officials advised individuals on vaccine safety and have urged them to continue to use existing protective methods alongside the vaccines.</p>

<p>A large U.S. study found no evidence that taking Ozempic or Wegovy is tied to an increase in suicidal thoughts, researchers reported recently.</p>
<p>Both Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and the <strong>obesity</strong> treatment Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide.</p>
<p>The analysis included electronic medical record data from more than 1.8 million patients. Researchers actually found a lower risk of new and <strong>recurring</strong> suicidal thoughts in those taking semaglutide compared to those using other medications for weight loss or diabetes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Ozempic is displayed in a pharmacy in Provo, Utah on March 29, 2023.

</span></div>
<p>Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 agonists<strong>, </strong>which were designed to treat type 2 diabetes. In addition to helping control blood sugar levels, the drugs produce a feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>Concerns over reports of suicidal <strong>ideation</strong> connected with semaglutide led to an investigation by the European Medicines Agency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed suicidal ideation as a possible safety concern for GLP-1 drugs.</p>
<p>A <em>Reuters</em> examination last year found that the FDA had received 265 reports of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking semaglutide or similar medicines since 2010. Thirty-six of those reports describe a death by suicide or suspected suicide.</p>
<p>Such events do not prove a connection between a drug and a side effect. But they can signal to officials a need to study a specific risk.</p>
<p>The study appeared online in the journal <em>Nature</em>. It was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The researchers examined data on 240,258 U.S. patients <strong>prescribed</strong> Wegovy or other medications for weight loss and nearly 1.6 million with type 2 diabetes prescribed Ozempic or other treatments.</p>
<p>Researchers compared nearly 53,000 Wegovy patients to the same number of closely matched users of other weight-loss drugs.</p>
<p>They found that during the first six months of use, first-time suicidal thoughts were reported by 0.11 percent of Wegovy users. That is compared to 0.43 percent of users of other drugs that do not belong to the same class as semaglutide.</p>
<p>After taking other risk factors into consideration, the risk of first-time suicidal thoughts was 73 percent lower with Wegovy, the researchers said.</p>
<p>No patient in the Wegovy group reported a suicide attempt, compared to 14 users of the other drugs, the report said.</p>
<p>Among patients with a history of suicidal thoughts, the risk of recurring suicidal thoughts was 56 percent lower with Wegovy than other weight-loss medicines.</p>
<p>Similar patterns were seen for use of Ozempic compared with other diabetes drugs.</p>
<p>The findings were <strong>consistent</strong> no matter the patients' sex, age, or ethnicity for both semaglutide types, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Such a study cannot prove that GLP-1 agonists do not increase the risk of suicidal ideation. But the findings may reduce concerns.</p>
<p>The researchers were unable to <strong>assess</strong> the statistical significance of differences in actual suicide attempts. The researchers noted that suicide attempts are "critically different from suicidal ideations."</p>
<p>Pamela Davis is a professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Ohio. She was one of the writers of the study. She said the growth in popularity of Ozempic makes it very important "to understand all its <strong>potential</strong> complications."</p>
<p>Suggestions that the drug may cause suicidal thoughts are not supported by "this very large and <strong>diverse</strong> population in the U.S.," Davis added.<br/>

<p>Enock Twagirayesu was seeking safety when he and his family fled violence in Burundi more than 10 years ago. They found it in Uganda. The small East African nation has taken in thousands of refugees from neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Twagirayesu and his family live in Nakivale Refugee Settlement, near the Tanzanian border. There were two children in his family when they arrived in Uganda. Today, there are eight children.</p>
<p>Growing families like his -- and the arrival of new refugees -- have put pressure on the land that makes up the settlement.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A sapling is held before it is planted inside Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Mbarara, Uganda, on Dec. 5, 2023.

</span></div>
<p>Twenty years ago, the area was a thick forest. Today, the trees are mostly gone. They have been cut down for cooking fuel. When Twagirayesu saw women digging up roots to burn a few years ago, he knew it was time to act.</p>
<p>"When the trees are finished, we will also be finished," Twagirayesu said. "Because if there are no trees to be used for cooking, even the people cannot survive."</p>
<p>Twagirayesu and two other refugees began planting trees in 2016. That early group quickly grew. Twagirayesu now leads the Nakivale Green Environment Association. Its members carry out what Twagirayesu calls the urgent business of reforesting.</p>
<p>Nakivale is the oldest refugee settlement in Africa. It has about 180,000 refugees. Some are from Burundi, while others are from Congo and Rwanda. New people come all the time. Once the refugees register with Uganda, they are granted a small piece of land on which they can live. They can build small homes and plant gardens.</p>
<p>Nsamizi Training Institute for Social Development is a local organization. It is supporting the tree-planting activities of Twagirayesu and others. The institute's yearly goal is to plant 300,000 trees.</p>
<p>On a recent afternoon, a group of refugees planted baby pine trees on a hill above a school. One of the school's teachers said she hopes the tree-planting project reduces the amount of water that runs off from rains. If it rains too much, the water floods the schoolyard and students are forced to stay inside.</p>
<p>Twagirayesu said the group has planted at least 460,000 trees in Nakivale. The trees are pine, acacia and bamboo. The refugees who plant the trees say being able to walk under the tree cover provides them peace.</p>
<p>But they also worry officials may one day want to send them home. They believe Ugandan officials may seek to protect the new trees and remove the people from the land.</p>
<p>But for now, Twagirayesu says, "when we are walking in the places where we planted trees, we feel much happiness."</p>

            <title>NASA Prepares for First Flight of Its New Supersonic Jet  (2024/1/22)</title>

<p>The American space agency NASA is preparing to test a new supersonic airplane that could help establish a new generation of superfast aircraft.</p>
<p>The new aircraft is called X-59, and it was built in partnership with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The experimental plane is part of a NASA project, or mission, called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/quesst/">Quesst</a>.</p>
<p>The mission aims to collect data in the United States on the level of noise produced by supersonic travel. Supersonic describes a vehicle that travels faster than the speed of sound: about 1,235 kilometers an hour.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="NASA's X-59 supersonic research aircraft sits outside Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Image Credit: NASA Lockheed Martin Skunk Works)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3307-08dc191995d2_cx2_cy10_cw92_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">NASA's X-59 supersonic research aircraft sits outside Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Image Credit: NASA Lockheed Martin Skunk Works)</span></div>
<p>The data Quesst gathers could lead U.S. officials to change rules that currently ban supersonic flights over land. NASA says the X-59 was developed to reduce the loudness of the <strong>sonic boom</strong> it produces when breaking the sound barrier to very low levels heard on the ground.</p>
<p>A few U.S. companies are exploring ways to restart supersonic passenger travel for the first time since 2003. That is the year the Concorde aircraft stopped flying. The Concorde was the world's first supersonic passenger jet. It was operated jointly by Britain and France.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The Concorde flew at speeds more than twice the speed of sound, British Airways <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.britishairways.com/content/information/about-ba/history-and-heritage/celebrating-concorde#:~:text=About%20Concorde&amp;text=With%20a%20take%2Doff%20speed,hours%20for%20a%20subsonic%20flight.">explained</a>. This meant it could travel from London to New York in about three-and-a-half hours. The same flight took about eight hours with normal passenger jets.</p>
<p>The new supersonic planes being developed make less noise and use less fuel than the Concorde. But manufacturers are under pressure from environmental groups and airports to meet the same noise and carbon emission limits as traditional planes.</p>
<p>NASA and Lockheed Martin recently showed off the X-59 plane during an event in Palmdale, California.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy called the development of the supersonic aircraft a "major <strong>accomplishment</strong>." She noted that members of the NASA and Lockheed Martin teams had worked hard to take the X-59 from an idea to reality "in just a few years."</p>
<p>Melroy added her hope that the X-59 "will help change the way we travel, bringing us closer together in much less time."</p>
<p>The aircraft measures 30 meters long and nine meters wide. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-lockheed-martin-reveal-x-59-quiet-supersonic-aircraft/">said</a> in a press release that the X-59 is expected to fly at 1.4 times the speed of sound, or about 1,500 kilometers per hour. The aircraft's design, shape and technologies will permit it to reach high speeds while producing "a quieter sonic <strong>thump</strong>," the agency explained.</p>
<p>The X-59 has not yet completed a test flight. But NASA officials have said they expect that to happen sometime this year. The team will be carrying out other tests in the coming months, including instrument experiments, fast engine runs and ground testing.</p>
<p>Once the aircraft has been cleared to fly, it will be deployed to several cities across the U.S. to collect data on the sounds the plane produces and how people on the ground react to the noise.</p>
<p>The data will be provided to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and international flight <strong>regulators</strong>. The information will help regulators decide whether to change existing laws restricting supersonic flight.</p>
<p>NASA said one of the biggest differences between the X-59 and other supersonic planes is that it has a thinner, smaller nose. The nose, which was reduced by about one-third, aims to break up shock waves that results in more intense sonic booms.</p>
<p>The Quesst team "also designed the aircraft with its engine mounted on top and gave it a smooth underside" in an effort to reduce shock waves near the back of the plane, NASA said.</p>
<p>Another American company developing supersonic aircraft is Boom Supersonic in Colorado. The company first <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-company-shows-off-new-supersonic-test-aircraft/5615452.html">showed off</a> its experimental supersonic plane, the XB-1, in October 2020. Boom has been carrying out tests of the aircraft since then.</p>
<p>The company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://boomsupersonic.com/flyby/xb-1-path-to-first-flight-december-update">says</a> on its website that its development and testing activities during the past few years have centered on ground tests, including a series of taxi runs. In 2024, Boom said it plans to begin its "high-speed taxi testing" early in the year, while preparing for an actual flight test that could happen later in the year.</p>

<p>Archeologists have found a group of lost cities in the Amazon rainforest. The cities were home to at least 10,000 farmers around 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Stéphen Rostain first noticed the earthen <strong>mounds</strong> and buried roads in Ecuador more than twenty years ago. But at the time, "I wasn't sure how it all fit together," said Rostain. He was one of the researchers who reported on the findings in the publication <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Recent mapping using laser technology revealed those locations to be part of a group of settlements and connecting roads. The settlements are in the forested areas near the Andes mountains.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This LIDAR image provided by researchers in January 2024 shows complexes of rectangular platforms arranged around low squares and distributed along wide dug streets at the Kunguints site, Upano Valley in Ecuador.

<p>"It was a lost valley of cities," said Rostain, who directs investigations at France's National Center for Scientific Research. "It's <strong>incredible</strong>," he added.</p>
<p>The Upano people lived in the settlements between around 500 B.C. and 300 to 600 A.D. That was around the same time period as the Roman Empire in Europe, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Ancient people built on over 6,000 earthen mounds in an area surrounded by agricultural fields with <strong>drainage canals</strong>. The largest roads were 10 meters wide and went for 10 to 20 kilometers.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to estimate populations, the area was home to at least 10,000 people, and possibly about 15,000 or 30,000 at its highest point, said Antoine Dorison, a study co-writer. That is comparable to the estimated population of Roman-era London, then Britain's largest city.</p>
<p>"This shows a very dense occupation and an extremely <strong>complicated</strong> society," said Michael Heckenberger of the University of Florida. He was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>José Iriarte of the University of Exeter was also not involved in the study. He said it would have required a complex system of organized labor to build the roads and thousands of earthen mounds.</p>
<p>Iriarte said, "The Incas and Mayans built with stone, but people in Amazonia didn't usually have stone available to build — they built with mud."</p>
<p>The Amazon is often thought of as a wild area "with only small groups of people. But recent discoveries have shown us how much more complex the past really is," he added.</p>
<p>Scientists have recently also found evidence of complex rainforest societies that came before European contact elsewhere in the Amazon, including in Bolivia and Brazil.</p>
<p>"There's always been an incredible diversity of people and settlements in the Amazon, not only one way to live," said Rostain. "We're just learning more about them."</p>

<p>Are you interested in food, United States history, and the English language? If so, American cookbooks provide wide information in all three subjects. The first, published in 1796, started a market that continues in the 21st century with online publications of such works. And, the <strong>literature</strong> offers more than just <strong>recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Megan Elias is the director of food studies at Boston University and the writer of <em>Food on the Page: Cookbooks and American Culture</em>. She says that cookbooks do help teach us how to prepare food. But they provide more than that, too.</p>
<p>"The <strong>concept </strong>of meals, how many meals a day that people expect to eat? What do they expect to have in those meals?" Elias said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Despite the widespread availability of online recipes, print cookbooks, often with beautiful photographs inside, continue to sell well." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-b3f1-08dc0894e602_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Despite the widespread availability of online recipes, print cookbooks, often with beautiful photographs inside, continue to sell well.</span></div>
<p>They also inform readers about discoveries, equipment and technology related to food making.</p>
<p>Elias said, "What are the objects that are necessary to make the things and what exists? So, are you being asked to do something over an open fire or are you being asked to use an electric stove? Is it something that can be done in the <strong>microwave</strong>? If you see a lot of recipes for things that are <strong>preserved</strong><strong> </strong>for pickles, you know that you are looking at a time without <strong>refrigeration</strong>."</p>
<p>Amy Bentley is a food historian at New York University. She said that cookbooks from the 1800s were used as lifestyle and household guides. They include food recipes, but they were not central to the books back then.</p>
<p>"So, there's some recipes for food, but it could be recipes for a cleaning solvent or what to do when your child has been poisoned, how to clean, how to get <strong>stains</strong><strong> </strong>out," Bentley said.</p>
<p><em>American Cookery</em> by Amelia Simmons is the first cookbook published in the United States. Simmons wrote that her goal with the book was to improve the new generation of women in the U.S.</p>
<p>Megan Elias says that after the Civil War, cookbooks became more <strong>diverse</strong>. Writers started exploring local foods and customs in their work.</p>
<p>Elias said that Southern cookbooks tried to offer "... a beautiful version of the old South that will kind of heal over the wounds of the Civil War rather than dealing with the problems that caused the Civil War to begin with."</p>
<p>Some communities would put together a group cookbook to raise money. These cookbooks provide a look into what the American middle class was eating throughout the years. Such works serve as a record of the traditions and interests of different neighborhoods and groups.</p>
<p>Throughout the years cookbooks have signified humanity's growth in knowledge, <strong>trends</strong> and <strong>innovations</strong>. During the last part of the 19th century, for example, many recipes were informed by the dangers of food containing bacteria. Then, in the 1930s, refrigerators became common objects in American homes. The threat of bacterial infection from food dropped, and very soon, cooks adapted to the new conditions. New recipes and new cookbooks resulted.</p>
<p>But cookbooks are not complete reflections of American life. Elias said publishing companies mostly control cookbook content. And, their main goal is to make money from book sales.</p>
<p>"The publishing world doesn't necessarily have the goal of representing the truth of Americans who made it. It tends to be upper middle class, white, Northeastern."</p>
<p>In the 21st century, with the growth of social media and food websites, publishing companies have less control. These new ways to share recipes have led to more open discussions about food and cooking. This gives the public more choices and power.</p>
<p>Elias praised the new discussions around food.</p>
<p>"If you look at the comments on food blogs and on any kind of recipe site, you really get to see what people are cooking, and what they think of how they're cooking, and how they think of themselves as experts."</p>
<p>Physical cookbooks are still highly desirable as well, Bentley says. "They're very good to give as gifts. They're very, very popular because they're sort of neutral. And everyone loves a cookbook, especially with beautiful pages," she said.</p>

最新的限制措施将通过运河的船只减少了36%。巴拿马运河是世界上最繁忙的水道之一，连接太平洋和大西洋。</p>
<p>Canal officials have estimated reduced water levels could cost them between $500 million and $700 million in 2024, The Associated Press reports. The losses are linked to tolls shipping companies must pay to pass through the Panama Canal.<br/>
据美联社报道，运河官员估计，2024年水位下降可能会使他们损失5到7亿美元。这些损失与航运公司通过巴拿马运河必须支付的通行费有关。</p>
<p>The Central American nation is experiencing drought, or extremely dry weather. The climate condition can slow traffic and reduce safety in the 80-kilometer canal.<br/>
中美洲国家正在经历干旱或极端干旱的天气。气候条件会减缓这条80公里运河上的航行，并降低安全性。</p>
<p>Panama Canal Administrator Ricaurte Vásquez said the new restrictions reduce daily ship crossings to 24. The latest cut followed additional reductions last year. There were 38 crossings a day in normal times last year.<br/>
巴拿马运河管理局局长巴斯克斯表示，新的限制措施将每天的船只过境数量减少到24艘。最近的削减是在去年进一步削减之后进行的。去年正常时期每天有38艘船只过境。</p>
<p>Vásquez told the AP, "It's vital that the country sends a message that we're going to take this on and find a solution to this water problem." He added that in the first quarter of the fiscal year, the waterway saw a 20 percent reduction in goods and 791 fewer ships than during the same period the year before.<br/>
巴斯克斯告诉美联社，“最重要的是，国家发出一个信号，即我们将着手解决这一水问题。”他补充说，本财年第一季度与去年同期相比，通过该水道的货物减少了20%，船只减少了791艘。</p>
<p>Vásquez said the reductions were part of necessary control measures to make sure water levels remain high enough to permit at least 24 ships to pass daily. Officials are hoping the situation will improve in April, when the new rainy season starts.<br/>
巴斯克斯表示，这些减少是必要控制措施的一部分，以确保水位保持在足够高的水平，可以每天让至少有24艘船通过。官员们希望4月份新的雨季开始时情况会有所改善。</p>
<p>Weather experts blame the drought on climate change and the weather system called El Nino. El Nino is a warming of surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. This event usually causes hot, dry weather in Asia and Australia and can drive weather changes in other parts of the world.<br/>
气象专家将干旱归咎于气候变化和厄尔尼诺现象。厄尔尼诺现象是太平洋东部和中部海面温度的上升。这一事件通常会在亚洲和澳大利亚造成炎热干燥的天气，并可能导致世界其他地区的天气变化。</p>
<p>Vásquez warned that Panama must seek new water sources for both the canal's operations and drinking water. The same lakes that fill the canal also produce water for more than half of the country's 4 million people.<br/>
巴斯克斯警告说，巴拿马必须为运河的运营和饮用水寻找新的水源。填充运河的湖泊也为该国400万人口中的一半以上提供水源。</p>
<p>"The water problem is a national problem, not just of the canal," Vásquez said. "We have to address this issue across the entire country."<br/>
巴斯克斯说：“水问题是一个国家层面的问题，而不仅仅是运河的问题，我们必须在全国范围内解决这个问题。”</p>
<p>However, Vásquez told Reuters news agency he expects the waterway to meet its latest earnings targets, in part because of recent increases in tolls.<br/>
然而，巴斯克斯告诉路透社，他预计这条水道将实现最新的盈利目标，部分原因是最近通行费的上涨。</p>

            <title>US Businesses Concerned about Hiring Young, ‘Gen Z’ Workers  (2024/1/21)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A recent report from a higher education advising organization says nearly 40 percent of American employers avoid offering jobs to recent college graduates.</p>
<p>They said members of Generation Z, or ‘Gen Z,' the group of Americans born between 1997 and 2012, make a lot of mistakes in job <strong>interviews</strong>. They say they would rather employ older workers who work harder and are dependable.</p>
<p>The research comes from Intelligent, an organization that does research about higher education, the job market and helps young people prepare for college and work.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Students interact with industry representatives during a career event at Syracuse University. (Photo courtesy of Syracuse University)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-25b6-08dc18686255_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Students interact with industry representatives during a career event at Syracuse University. (Photo courtesy of Syracuse University)</span></div>
<p><strong>Unfavorable reviews</strong></p>
<p>The report came out in December and notes that, of 800 directors, managers and executives asked questions, 38 percent said they favor older workers. About 20 percent of employers said young people brought a parent with them to a job interview. Almost 60 percent of those surveyed said recent college graduates are unprepared for work and about half said they had to dismiss, or fire, a recent college graduate. Others said the young workers do not take criticism well.</p>
<p>Because of bad experiences with younger workers, more than half of the business leaders said they are putting policies in place that older workers want. For example, they are offering <strong>benefits</strong> that are important to older workers, paying higher salaries and permitting older workers to work from home. They also say they are willing to employ an older employee who is "overqualified" if it means they do not have to employ a younger worker.</p>
<p>One respondent gave an example of a Gen Z job seeker who refused to turn on their camera during a video interview.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of motivation</strong></p>
<p>Michael Connors is a <strong>recruiter</strong> in the Washington, D.C. area. That means he helps companies find job candidates. He said he is not surprised by the survey results. He said employers have real questions about the young job seekers.</p>
<p>He asked: "Do they even want this job, or do they just go through the motions?"</p>
<p>He said he has not had a job candidate say they will not use their camera for interviews. However, he has had some candidates choose noisy places for calls. One was sitting outside a shopping center during the interview.</p>
<p>Adam Capozzi is the career services director at Syracuse University in New York state. He said while many students are very good about online communication, managing data and have experience with spreadsheets, they need help with the "soft skills." Soft skills, he said, include making introductions in business settings, offering a good handshake, or even knowing how to ask for a business card.</p>
<p><strong>Soft skills</strong></p>
<p>Capozzi said students should pay special attention to three things when looking for jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>dressing well for interviews</li>
<li>making sure that their social media and LinkedIn profiles tell a story of their "core mission, vision and values,"</li>
<li>learn that networking is "so much more than going to a career fair."</li>
</ul>
<p>"You could be in an elevator at a specific office building or at a different establishment and bump into someone and strike up a 30-second conversation and not know who they are associated with and a positive first impression can lead to further conversation."</p>
<p>Diane Gayeski is a professor of strategic communications at Ithaca College in New York state. She worked on the survey.</p>
<p>She said one reason some members of Gen Z are having trouble is that the pandemic <strong>disrupted</strong> activities that lead to job-hunting success. She noted that some students missed out on <strong>internships</strong> and the chance to meet professionals who visited college campuses as guest speakers.</p>
<p>"Part of college readiness, college's ability to make students ready for their careers are the things that they experience outside the classroom, such as engaging with people who are different than they are and being able to work on projects that are in the community and engaging in internships, and all of that just didn't exist."</p>
<p>Managers noted that many students became used to missing project time limit dates, or deadlines, and class time. During the pandemic, some teachers eased a lot of rules.</p>
<p>But in the workplace, employers are not as permissive.</p>
<p>Kristin Williams is the Director of Career Services at Kent State University's business school in Ohio. She said she sees strong and promising students all the time. However, some of them do miss deadlines.</p>
<p>She notes part of that might be left over from the pandemic, when "we didn't know what was going to happen tomorrow." However, she said employers should be willing to train new employees who are having problems.</p>
<p>"Again, do we like it when those things happen? <strong>Absolutely</strong> not. I'm <strong>frustrated</strong> when a deadline is missed or there's repeated asks for an extension. At some point, someone has to be responsible for coaching [them] through that."</p>
<p>Williams said new employees need to be taught how to tell their supervisors they might miss a deadline ahead of time. And they should be taught how to <strong>prioritize</strong> the most important tasks.</p>
<p>Some of the criticisms in the Intelligent survey are part of having several generations in the workforce at the same time, Williams said. But she said that the Gen Z workers might make a "positive shift" in the workplace. She said other workers might end up working less, getting paid more and enjoying freedom to dress less formally at work because of Gen Z's behavior.</p>
<p>She added, if 40 percent of employers are worried about Gen Z, that means 60 percent are not.</p>

<p class="CxSpFirst">And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">On this program, we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give definitions, examples, and notes on usage.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">Today we are talking about expressions that come from two very different types of races – a marathon and a sprint.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Ethiopia's Tigist Assefa celebrates as she crosses the finish line to win the women's division of the Berlin Marathon in world record time in Berlin, Germany, Sunday, Sept. 24, 2023.

</span></div>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">A marathon is a foot race that happens over a long distance. It is a test of <strong>endurance</strong>. A sprint is a short race and tests speed. These two races each require different running methods to win.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">During a sprint, a runner does not center on time or distance. Instead, they simply try to run as fast as they can, using their full energy from the very start of the race.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">But things are different in a marathon. If a racer started out running as fast as possible from the beginning, he or she would likely quickly <strong><u>run out of steam</u></strong><u>.</u> This method, or strategy, would probably not result in success. Instead, marathon runners <u>need to <strong>pace </strong>themselves</u>. Pacing means considering the task you need to complete and the resources you have available. Possible resources include time, energy and money.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">Just like during a marathon, a person involved in a long-term project might consider pacing themselves. This is because long-term projects are more like marathons than sprints.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">A well-known saying describes life <u>as marathon, not a sprint.</u> This means people need to learn to be <strong>patient</strong> and not become worried if their life plans or dreams take some time. Things like finding a good job, creating a nice home or developing friendships all can take time.</p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle">There is also a similar expression to consider: <u>Slow and <strong>steady</strong> wins the race. </u></p>
<p>Now, let's hear two friends use these expressions in a conversation.</p>
<p><em>A: So, are you excited to move and start a new job? </em></p>
<p><em>B: I am! I want to learn about the city, make new friends, decorate my new apartment, and <strong>ace </strong>my new job!</em></p>
<p><em>A: That's a lot to focus on! It takes time to settle into a new place and feel at home. You don't want to get <strong>burned out.</strong> </em></p>
<p><em>B: That's a good point. But I really just want to start over and make a great life.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, that takes time. You know what they say, life is a marathon not a sprint. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I know. But I can't wait! I feel like sprinting!</em></p>
<p><em>A: I understand that feeling. I have an idea. I'll come visit in a couple of months and remind you to pace yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Ok, you've got a deal!</em></p>
<p>We can say that Learning English is also like a marathon, not a sprint. If you keep studying day by day, little by little, your English is sure to get better over time.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories!</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Andrew Smith.</p>

            <title>Asylum Seekers’ Court Cases Keep Growing  (2024/1/21)</title>

<p>The record number of immigrants entering the United States illegally has resulted in 3 million cases awaiting judgement in immigration courts around the country.</p>
<p>The city of Miami, Florida, is at the center of the immigration wave. There, 261,000 removal <strong>proceedings</strong> are awaiting a hearing.</p>
<p>Just 12 years ago, that number would have covered the whole country, said Austin Kocher. He is a professor at Syracuse University in New York who researches federal immigration detention.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An officer listens to a question as he directs people to a courtroom, Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2024, in an immigration court in Miami.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)</span></div>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) reports that Miami has the longest list, or docket, of these cases. The <strong>backlog </strong>includes immigrants who have been in the United States for many years but were arrested on charges not related to their entry into the country.</p>
<p>Most, however, are asylum seekers. They have told border security officials that they fear they will be in danger if they return to their home country.</p>
<p>The AP reports that the number of people being <strong>apprehended</strong> for illegally crossing the southern U.S. border has reached record levels. As a result, the court backlog of cases grew by more than 1 million in the last <strong>fiscal year</strong>.</p>
<p>Information from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearing house says the case backlog is three times larger than it was in 2019.</p>
<p>Judges, lawyers and migrant activists say they are worried the system no longer works.</p>
<p>It often takes several years to either <strong>grant</strong> people asylum or <strong>deport</strong> those who have no right to remain in the country.</p>
<p>The courts are administered by the Department of Justice. The backlogged courts have received limited attention.</p>
<p><strong>What happens at the border?</strong></p>
<p>When U.S. officials apprehend migrants at the border, a record is made of their detention. Most are then released into the U.S. and are told to appear in court in the city where they are headed. The information is passed from the Department of Homeland Security to the Justice Department, where the Executive Office for Immigration Review operates the courts.</p>
<p>Randy McGrorty is executive director of Catholic Legal Services for the Archdiocese of Miami, which has hundreds of thousands of migrants in its communities. He said, "They're just being released without any idea of what comes next."</p>
<p>Many immigrants come to the Catholic Legal Services for advice. It is now teaching them how to represent themselves before judges.</p>
<p>Miguel Mora is a Catholic Legal Services lawyer in Miami. He said, "We help them understand what judges want, and we help judges..."</p>
<p><strong>When immigrants go to court</strong></p>
<p>Aaron Rodriguez and Cindy Baneza are in their 20s. They recently appeared in an immigration court in Miami with three children. They are not married.</p>
<p>They communicated with the judge with the help of an <strong>interpreter</strong>. It had been eight months since they crossed the Rio Grande River and entered the U.S. illegally. They asked the judge to give them more time to find a lawyer so they could <strong>file</strong> an asylum claim.</p>
<p>Rodriguez, who is 23, told Judge Christina Martyak that he had no money for a lawyer. He had already received an extension for not having a lawyer.</p>
<p>Rodriguez and Baneza said they fled Honduras after a gang threatened them. The violent group had killed the father of Baneza's oldest child. The gang threatened them with more violence unless they paid them money they earned from their <strong>tortilla</strong> business.</p>
<p>Rodriguez told the AP: "We were left with no other option than get out of the country."</p>
<p>Judge Martyak agreed to give Rodriguez and Baneza an additional three months. She told them to seek free legal assistance from the Catholic Archdiocese of Miami.</p>
<p><strong>The backlog keeps growing</strong></p>
<p>Time does not reduce the backlog, however. Government records show that judges completed far more cases in the last year than ever before. But their dockets keep growing.</p>
<p>Mimi Tsankov is president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tsankov said the average number of cases per judge is now 5,000. She said if the number of judges doubled to about 1,400, the current backlog would be solved by 2032.</p>
<p>In the latest budget request, the Executive Office for Immigration Review said it is requesting that Congress provide money for 150 new judges and support workers, the AP reports.</p>
<p>Paul Schmidt is a retired immigration government lawyer. He was working when the last major system reform took place nearly 40 years ago. He said the system can only be fixed with major policy changes. One example of such a change would be to permit most asylum cases to be solved through an administrative process instead of through a court of law.</p>

            <title>Plan to Create ‘Green’ City in California to Be Put to Voters  (2024/1/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Developers of a proposed new city in northern California have begun presenting their plans to voters.</p>
<p>Jan Sramek leads the project, called California Forever. Sramek is a former trader with American financial services company Goldman Sachs. He recently started a campaign to seek community support in Solano County for the new city.</p>
<p>The project needs the support because current community rules bar development of some agricultural land. California Forever needs the written support of 13,000 Solano County voters to propose the building project on a ballot in November elections.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This aerial photo shows farmland in rural Solano County, Calif., Aug. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;225;squez, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-5638-08dc1842d4ff_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This aerial photo shows farmland in rural Solano County, Calif., Aug. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V<i>&amp;#</i>225;squez, File)</span></div>
<p>Leaders of the project have already spent more than $800 million on land purchases in an area between San Francisco and Sacramento. Planners say they aim to create an environment friendly and walkable city with <strong>affordable</strong> housing and good jobs.</p>
<p>Among billionaire backers of the project are <strong>philanthropist</strong> Laurene Powell Jobs, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and investor and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen.</p>
<p>Planners want to build about 20,000 homes for 50,000 residents. The city will sit between Travis Air Force Base and the small city of Rio Vista. The housing is to be built within walking distance to jobs, schools, restaurants and stores. Developers have suggested the city's population could one day reach 400,000.</p>
<p>Since it was formed in 2017, California Forever has bought more than 202 square kilometers of farmland in Solano County. The plan calls for $400 million to help Solano County residents buy homes in the proposed community.</p>
<p>Sramek has already held a series of community meetings around the county. But the efforts have not quieted critics who have been opposed to the project since the start of land-buying began in the area years ago.</p>
<p>The land California Forever is targeting sits in the heart of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, which serves as home to many fish and wildlife species. The Delta is also a source for the area's already limited water supply. Critics of the project worry that adding more development will further harm an already threatened <strong>ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<p>But supporters say Solano County is a smart place to build because the area has a big need for additional housing. There is especially a great need for affordable homes for teachers, firefighters, police and other public workers.</p>
<p>Gabriel Metcalf is head of planning for California Forever. He told The Associated Press he thinks Solano County is a good place because it will appeal to military contractors, as well as technology and construction companies seeking a new project.</p>
<p>Metcalf said, if "we can provide companies with a pathway to growth, we think we'll get some major employers creating jobs here that would otherwise go out of state, to places like Texas."</p>

<p>Japan on Friday became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon. The <strong>mission's</strong> aim was to carry out an exact landing and to collect information about the Earth's only natural satellite.</p>
<p>Japan's space agency, known as JAXA, said its Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon, called SLIM, landed on the moon's surface at 15:20 UTC Friday. It then re-established communication with Earth. But its <strong>solar panels</strong> were not able to create electricity, possibly because they are pointed in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>"SLIM is now operating only on its battery, and we are <strong>prioritizing</strong> the <strong>transfer</strong> of its data to Earth," Hitoshi Kuninaka, the head of JAXA's research center, told reporters.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="People raise their hands after a moon landing by the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM), in a public viewing event in Sagamihara, south of Tokyo, Japan January 20, 2024.

<p>A battery is a device that stores electricity.</p>
<p>Space officials are attempting to save power by turning off equipment like its heaters. But SLIM's battery only lasts "a few hours."</p>
<p>JAXA hopes a change in the sun's position in the sky will cause the panels to receive sunlight to power the vehicle, Kuninaka said. He added that it takes 30 days for the direction of sunlight to change on the moon.</p>
<p>SLIM attempted to land within 100 meters of its target, instead of within several kilometers. JAXA said this exact landing technology will become a powerful tool in the search for oxygen, fuel, and water on the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Landings on the moon</strong></p>
<p>Japan aims to play a bigger part in space, partnering with ally the United States. Japan is also home to several private space companies. JAXA aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program in the next few years.</p>
<p>But the Japanese space agency has recently faced several setbacks in rocket development. They include the launch failure in March of its new H3 rocket which is meant to compete with rockets made by private companies like SpaceX.</p>
<p>The failure caused delays in Japan's space missions, including SLIM and joint moon exploration with India. India made a historic landing on the moon's most southern point with its Chandrayaan-3 <strong>probe</strong>.</p>
<p>JAXA has twice landed on asteroids, but the moon's gravity makes landing on it more difficult, its scientists said. Three missions to the moon by Japanese company ispace, Russia's space agency, and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year.</p>
<p>Only four nations, the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India, have successfully carried out a soft landing on the moon. No private company has been able to do it.</p>
<p>SLIM measures 2.4 meters by 2.7 meters—about the size of a car. It has two main engines, along with 12 smaller thrusters. It also includes equipment like solar cells, radar, and cameras.</p>
<p>SLIM weighed 700 kilograms at launch. That is less than half the weight of India's Chandrayaan-3.</p>
<p>As the probe got closer to the surface, it was designed to compare its camera's images with satellite photos of the moon. JAXA has said this method permits an exact landing.</p>
<p>On landing, reports say SLIM successfully released two small robot probes. One moves by taking small jumps, or hops. The other is an even smaller baseball-sized wheeled vehicle. Sony Group and <strong>toy</strong> company Tomy, and several Japanese universities developed the robots.</p>
<p>SLIM was launched on Japan's H-IIA rocket in September. It has taken a fuel-saving four-month trip to the moon.</p>

<p>A collection of modern <strong>statues</strong> has been placed around Venezuela's capital Caracas in an attempt to increase local interest in art.</p>
<p>A total of 19 <strong>fiberglass</strong> pieces – created by Venezuelan artist Antonio Azzato – are sitting in public spaces around the city.</p>
<p>The statues are modeled after the famous 17<sup>th</sup>-century painting "Las Meninas" by Spanish artist Diego Velazquez. That piece shows a young princess, Margaret Theresa, being assisted by two helpers. The painting is displayed in Madrid's Prado museum.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Venezuelan artist Antonio Azzato retouches one of his sculptures from the Meninas Caracas Gallery street exhibition, which plays homage to Spaniard artist Diego Velazquez's Las Meninas, in Caracas on January 11, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>The larger-than-life statues, or figures, appear in Caracas in modern, colorful designs. They show the same rounded dress shape as the princess in the Velazquez painting. The tops have a head, but no face.</p>
<p>The figures are made to look like different people or things. One is painted to look like Gleyber Torres, a baseball player with the New York Yankees who comes from Venezuela. Another represents singer Oscar D'Leon, while others are painted to look like colorful birds or flowers.</p>
<p>Azzato told Reuters news agency his street statues are designed to give the public a break from technology and the modern world. He hopes the street placements will persuade people to briefly stop and think about art.</p>
<p>"Lots of people don't know Velazquez and don't know Las Meninas," Azzato said. He added he hopes the figures will lead people – particularly younger ones – to be curious about the pieces and "to look closer" at the statues and their meaning.</p>
<p>Azzato has put statues in other cities in the past. In all, he says he has created almost 300. Among them were figures made to represent tennis player Rafael Nadal and other famous individuals.</p>

            <title>China's Population Declines Again in 2023  (2024/1/20) | 2023年中国人口总量再次下降</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>China announced recently that the country's mainland population fell by 2 million people in 2023.<br/>
中国最近公布，2023年中国大陆人口减少了200万。</p>
<p>This drop is the second yearly decrease in population, adding to concerns about the country's future economic growth.<br/>
这是中国人口的第二次年度下降，加剧了人们对该国未来经济增长的担忧。</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Statistics said the total number of people in China dropped by 2.08 million, or 0.15 percent, to 1.409 billion in 2023. China does a full population count, or census, every 10 years.<br/>
中国国家统计局表示，2023年，中国的总人口减少了208万，即0.15%，降至14.09亿。中国每10年进行一次人口普查。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Increased deaths and decreased fertility<br/>
死亡率增加，生育率下降</span></p>
<p>The number of deaths rose by 690,000 to 11.1 million, more than twice the increase recorded in 2022. Population experts said the aging of the population and COVID-19 outbreaks account for most of the rise.<br/>
死亡人口增加了69万，达到1110万，是2022年记录的两倍多。人口专家表示，人口老龄化和新冠肺炎疫情是增长的主要原因。</p>
<p>But the data also suggested important information about the number of births, which fell by 540,000, or 5.6 percent. The drop was smaller than the decreases of the past three years.<br/>
但数据也提供了有关出生人数的重要信息，出生人数减少了54万，即5.6%。降幅小于过去三年的降幅。</p>
<p>Still, the decreasing birth rate suggests that the fertility rate is a long-term economic and societal problem for China.<br/>
尽管如此，出生率的下降表明，生育率对中国来说是一个长期的经济和社会问题。</p>
<p>The lower fertility rate, together with people living longer because of better health care, means China is slowly growing older.<br/>
较低的生育率，加上人们因为医疗保健改善而寿命更长，意味着中国正在慢慢老龄化。</p>
<p>Demographer Zuo Xuejin, formerly of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, estimated that the proportion of the population that is 65 or older could double to more than 30 percent by 2050.<br/>
原上海社会科学院人口学家左学金估计，到2050年，65岁及以上人口的比例可能会翻一番，达到30%以上。</p>
<p>These population changes could slow economic growth over time.<br/>
随着时间的推移，这些人口变化可能会减缓经济增长。</p>
<p>Other countries in the region also face long-term population problems. Japan's birth rate was 6.3 per 1,000 people in 2022, while South Korea's rate was 4.9.<br/>
该区域其他国家也面临着长期的人口问题。2022年，日本的出生率为每1000人6.3人，而韩国为4.9人。</p>
<p>"As we have observed again and again from other low fertility countries, fertility decline is often very difficult to reverse," University of Michigan demographer Zhou Yun said.<br/>
密歇根大学人口学家周云说：“正如我们在其他低生育率国家一再观察到的那样，生育率下降往往很难逆转。”</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">19 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Le about the difference between the words "university" and "college."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: University vs. College " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-0262-08dc18618d92_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: University vs. College </span></div>
<p>I love this program.</p>
<p>Would you mind explaining the difference between "university" and "college?"</p>
<p>I often misunderstand these two nouns.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Le</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>We are glad you love our programs, Le, and thank you for writing to us.</p>
<p>This is an important question, especially for international students who might want to apply to U.S. colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Both places provide higher education. But their <strong>degree</strong> offerings, number of students and costs differ.</p>
<p>Let's start with "university."</p>
<p><strong>University</strong></p>
<p>"Universities" are large schools offering higher education that includes <strong>undergraduate</strong> and <strong>graduate</strong> degree programs.</p>
<p>Most <strong>faculty</strong> at universities are not only teachers but also researchers.</p>
<p>Large universities have tens of thousands of students and have students from all over the U.S. and the world.</p>
<p>Since universities offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees, they may offer many classes in many fields. But the cost of attending a university can be high, especially at private universities in the U.S. which are not supported by state governments.</p>
<p>An example of a public university is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/west-virginia-university-to-cut-languages-creative-programs/7249320.html">West Virginia University</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a private university is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-colleges-ask-for-more-writing-after-affirmative-action-ban/7209025.html">Yale University</a> in the state of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Let's move on to "college."</p>
<p><strong>College </strong></p>
<p>"College" can also mean a school where students receive higher education. Many high school students are asked:</p>
<p><em>Where do you want to go to college?</em></p>
<p>The answer to this question could be a university, a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/community-colleges-offer-more-programs-at-low-cost/6813478.html">community college</a> or even a <strong>trade</strong> school.</p>
<p>We also refer to students in higher education as "college students."</p>
<p><em>When Liz was a college student, she took classes during the day and worked in a hotel at night. </em></p>
<p>"College" is often used as a general word for a school offering education after high school. But "college" can have more specific meanings too.</p>
<p>Colleges are smaller schools that focus on undergraduate programs. They include community colleges, private and liberal arts colleges and even technical colleges and trade schools.</p>
<p>Faculty at community colleges mainly teach and advise students, rather than do research.</p>
<p>A college can also be a division within a university. For example, a university might have a "college of arts and sciences," which gives bachelor's degrees.</p>
<p>Colleges are smaller and have fewer students: hundreds to thousands of students rather than tens of thousands of students.</p>
<p>Because colleges, especially community colleges, serve a smaller population, they have fewer international students.</p>
<p>Classes are also likely to be limited at colleges, especially at some community colleges. They might offer general education classes, <strong>career</strong> or technical degrees. Community colleges might offer some four-year undergraduate degrees, but many offer two-year programs. The aim might be for students to transfer to a four-year school. Career or technical <strong>certificates</strong> permit students to immediately enter the workforce upon completing the classes.</p>
<p><em>She went to a community college to study cooking to get a job working in a restaurant. </em></p>
<p>The cost of attending a community college is lower. The schools offer a low-cost way to gain college credits. However, private colleges and some technical schools may be just as costly as private universities.</p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Le.</p>

<p>Genetic researchers at the University of Cambridge in Britain say ancient DNA shows why northern Europeans have a higher risk of getting a nerve disease than other Europeans.</p>
<p>The disease is called multiple sclerosis or MS. The researchers said the risk lies in genes from horse-riding cattle <strong>herders</strong> who entered northern Europe about 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The findings come from a huge project to compare modern DNA with ancient genetic material taken from human remains including teeth and bones.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by the University of Copenhagen in January 2024 shows the process of ancient DNA extraction at the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Center in Copenhagen.

<p>A study <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/first-evidence-of-horseback-riding-dates-back-5-000-years/6994072.html">released last year</a> said it identified the earliest evidence of horse riding in people called the Yamnaya. The scientists say they lived 4,500 to 5,000 years ago during the Bronze Age period of human history.</p>
<p>The Yamnaya moved from the grasslands of what is now Ukraine and Russia into northwestern Europe. However, the researchers say those people carried gene versions that today are known to increase a person's risk of multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>The researchers added that they believe the same genes protected those herders from infections from their cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>The research was published in <em>Nature</em>, a scientific publication.</p>
<p>William Barrie is a genetic researcher at Cambridge. He helped write the study. He said everyone involved was surprised. "These <strong>variants</strong> were giving these people an <strong>advantage</strong> of some kind," he said.</p>
<p>The finding was made possible by a gene bank with thousands of examples of early humans in Europe and western Asia. That project is led by Eske Willerslev of Cambridge and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.</p>
<p>While MS can strike any population it is most common among white descendants of northern Europeans. Scientists have been unable to explain why.</p>
<p>The cause of the disease is not known. However, one theory is that infections could cause it in people who have certain genetic qualities. Scientists say they have found 230 genetic variants that might increase the risk of MS.</p>
<p>The researchers studied DNA from about 1,600 ancient Eurasians. They used the information to develop of map of population movements in northern Europe. They said farmers from the Middle East began pushing out hunter-gatherers about 5,000 years ago. Then the Yamnaya moved in. They traveled with horses and wagons and herded cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>The research team compared the ancient DNA to the genetic information of 400,000 modern-day people stored in UK Biobank in Britain. They wanted to see if MS-linked genetic variations persisted in the north. That is the part of Europe where the Yamnaya moved, rather than southern Europe.</p>
<p>In what is now Denmark, the Yamnaya replaced ancient farmers, making them the closest ancestors of modern Danes, Willerslev said.</p>
<p>Rates of MS are especially high in the northern part of Europe known as Scandinavia.</p>
<p>The findings raise additional questions and suggest a need for more research. One of the writers of the study, Astrid Iverson of Oxford University, questioned why a gene variant that seems to have strengthened <strong>immunity</strong> later plays a part in causing what is believed to be an <strong>autoimmune</strong> disease. Differences in how modern humans are exposed to animal germs might push the immune system out of balance, she said.</p>

<p>Many parts of the world have experienced record-high temperatures in recent days.</p>
<p>But much of the United States is dealing with extremely cold weather, thanks to what is known as a polar vortex.</p>
<p>A map showing world temperatures over the last several days had a dark red color in the Arctic, Asia, the Middle East, South America and parts of Africa. The dark red means the temperatures are 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the average from just over 20 years ago.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A worker pauses while removing snow from Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., Jan. 14, 2024.

<p>The United States is one of the only places on the map that is dark blue, meaning very cold.</p>
<p>In the state of North Dakota, <strong>wind chills</strong> reached minus 56 degrees Celsius. Last week in the state of Missouri, a professional American football game took place as temperatures dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>On the other side of the world, the world's top tennis players are playing in unusually warm weather in Melbourne, Australia. The Australian Open is taking place as the city records temperatures nearly 7 degrees warmer than average.</p>
<p>The African nation of Oman is in the northern hemisphere, where it is winter. It recently set a record for the warmest January night at 26.4 Celsius. Parts of the southern hemisphere are experiencing warmer-than-usual weather, too. Argentina set a record for warmest January night at 27.3 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Climate scientists say these extreme temperatures are due to warming in the Arctic.</p>
<p>They say warming temperatures in the Arctic affect the weather all around the world. The pattern called a polar vortex is not unusual in the Arctic. However, experts say as temperatures in the north warm, the polar vortex widens and affects Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Jennifer Francis is with the Woodwell Research Center in Massachusetts. She is a leading researcher in the theory of Arctic Amplification, which links the periods of cold weather to climate change.</p>
<p>She said, "When the Arctic is <strong>off-the-charts</strong> warm (like now), we're more likely to see <strong>frigid</strong> cold invade places like Texas that are ill-equipped to deal with it," she said.</p>
<p>Francis added, "Rapid Arctic warming is one of the clearest symptoms of human-caused climate change."</p>
<p>Judah Cohen works for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial weather company near Boston, Massachusetts. He compared the polar vortex to an ice skater doing a <strong>spin</strong>.</p>
<p>When a skater spins very quickly, the "vortex" winds stay close to the skater. But if the skater slows down, the winds lose their tight circle.</p>
<p>"All the cold air then gets released away from the center of the polar vortex," Cohen said.</p>
<p>When that happens in January, the target of the cold air is the United States. Cohen said the current polar vortex is stronger and longer lasting than usual.</p>
<p>Marshall Shepherd is a <strong>meteorology</strong> professor at the University of Georgia. He said that right now, there is a "complex <strong>interaction</strong> within our climate system."</p>
<p>"Winter will always bring us cold weather, but like the warm season, it may be changing [in] ways that we understand and [in] ways that we are still learning about," Shepherd said.</p>
<p>The weather experts said the extreme cold in the U.S. will change to unusually warm weather in several days. But another polar vortex is expected to hit at the end of January.</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>In recent years, more and more people have been talking about mental health. The pandemic made many people feel <strong>isolated </strong>or alone. The isolation caused some people to struggle more with their mental health.</p>
<p>Different countries and cultures have different ideas about mental health. In the United States, <strong>conversations</strong> about mental health and mental illness are changing. Many well-known people have come forward and shared their mental health <strong>journeys</strong> through books and social media.</p>
<p>As ideas about mental health change, so does the language we use to talk about the issue.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Language and Mental Health " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-2e1f-08dc1793d497_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Language and Mental Health </span></div>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will talk about the language of mental health.</p>
<p>Let's start with the question, "What is mental health?"</p>
<p><strong>What is mental health? </strong></p>
<p>"Mental health" contains the adjective "mental" and the noun "health." Together, the words become a compound noun meaning the conditions around one's mental and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>If someone has good mental health, they are in good emotional and mental condition.</p>
<p>Now let's look at "mental illness." Mental illness is a compound noun with the same adjective "mental," but with the noun "illness." If someone has a mental illness, they have a medical condition that affects their mind, personality or emotions.</p>
<p>The illness harms their mental functioning and can affect their thinking, feelings and behaviors. Examples of mental illnesses include depression and <strong>anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>The word "<strong>disorder</strong>" may also be used with some mental illnesses. For example, you may know someone who has an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Person-focused language</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about someone's mental health, it is important to use the right words. We want to be respectful of the person and understanding of their situation. We can use language that is centered on the person rather than their mental health issues.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to say a person is "living with" their condition.</p>
<p>The structure for this is:</p>
<p>Subject + verb <em>live </em>+ preposition <em>with +</em> noun form of illness.</p>
<p><em>Kurt lives with anxiety</em>.</p>
<p>Another acceptable and simple way to describe Kurt would be to say "Kurt has anxiety."</p>
<p>The structure for that is: Subject + verb <em>have +</em> noun form of illness.</p>
<p>We can use this instead of using an adjective form of their mental health condition, as in <em>"Kurt is an anxious person."</em></p>
<p><strong>Avoid stereotypes</strong></p>
<p>It is also important to avoid certain words in some settings. For example, words like "psycho" and "crazy" may seem informal and acceptable to use, but they can cause harm. The word "psycho," when used informally, means an unstable and aggressive person.</p>
<p>For example: <em>Her ex-boyfriend is such a psycho.</em></p>
<p>"Psycho" is related to "psychosis," a mental disorder in which a person has a disconnection from reality. Experts say using such words outside of a mental health discussion can lead to <strong>stigma</strong>. Stigma is a set of negative beliefs that a culture has about something. Stigma can prevent people from seeking help with their own mental illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>In today's Everyday Grammar we talk about the best words and language to use when talking about mental health. We learned how to use person-centered language to talk about someone with a mental illness. And we learned that some words should be avoided to help end the stigma around mental illness.</p>

            <title>What Are Hypersonic Weapons and Which Nations Have Them?  (2024/1/18)</title>

<span class="byline">By VOA</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">17 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>North Korea announced earlier this week it had carried out a test of a hypersonic weapon attached to a missile. It was not the first time the country has claimed to carry out such a test. North Korean officials announced the first one in 2021.</p>
<p>Several other nations have confirmed they are also developing and testing hypersonic weapons. What are these weapons and which countries have them?</p>
<p><strong>What is a hypersonic weapon?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A ballistic missile, said to be solid-fuel and hypersonic, launches during a test at an unspecified location in North Korea in this picture released by the Korean Central News Agency on January 14, 2024. (KCNA via REUTERS)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4e28-08dc1780fedc_cx0_cy0_cw95_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A ballistic missile, said to be solid-fuel and hypersonic, launches during a test at an unspecified location in North Korea in this picture released by the Korean Central News Agency on January 14, 2024. (KCNA via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>A hypersonic weapon is designed to fly at superfast speeds equal to at least five times the speed of sound, known as Mach 5. This is about 6,200 kilometers per hour. These weapons are similar to <strong>ballistic</strong> missiles, which can also reach hypersonic speeds.</p>
<p>But, the difference with hypersonic weapons is that they are highly <strong>maneuverable</strong>. This means they are easy to direct and control in flight. Ballistic missiles generally have set paths with very little maneuverability.<strong> </strong>Since the path, or trajectory, of hypersonic weapons can be changed, they are harder to identify. This means they are difficult to destroy with existing missile defense systems.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of hypersonic weapons currently exist?</strong></p>
<p>The two main kinds of hypersonic weapons are hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles.</p>
<p>Hypersonic <strong>glide</strong> vehicles launch from a rocket. The glide vehicle then separates from the rocket and "glides" at speeds of at least Mach 5 toward a target.</p>
<p>Hypersonic cruise missiles do not have a glide vehicle and are powered by high-speed, air-breathing engines.</p>
<p><strong>How do hypersonic missiles operate?</strong></p>
<p>Hypersonic missiles generally launch warheads at speeds of at least Mach 5 while traveling at fairly low altitudes. Newly developed hypersonic weapons fly higher than less speedy missiles, but lower than intercontinental ballistic missiles. Hypersonic weapons are more difficult to identify and shoot down.</p>
<p><strong>How far along is North Korea's development?</strong></p>
<p>North Korea's first hypersonic missile test, carried out in 2021, used a glider-shaped warhead. Another launch, in 2022, involved what South Korean military officials said was a kind of ballistic missile warhead with maneuverability to hit a target.</p>
<p>North Korean state media said the country's latest launch came on January 14. It aimed to test the performance of a new <strong>multistage</strong>, solid-fuel engine attached to a hypersonic warhead.</p>
<p>North Korea described the test as a success. South Korean military officials said the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.</p>
<p>International experts have said North Korea is interested in hypersonic technology because it can be used to distantly deploy weapons while avoiding missile defense systems. North Korea could, for example, use such weapons to target U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam.</p>
<p><strong>Who leads the hypersonic race?</strong></p>
<p>The United States, Russia and China are all developing hypersonic weapons. Additional nations are carrying out research, while others have claimed tests that have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>U.S. military and intelligence officials say China is building and testing both hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. U.S. officials say China is believed to have carried out "hundreds" of hypersonic weapons tests between 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>Reuters reported on one Chinese test in 2021. A hypersonic glide vehicle flew through space and circled the world before heading down toward its target, the news agency said.</p>
<p>Also in 2021, Russia successfully tested a hypersonic cruise missile. President Vladimir Putin described the launch as the start of a new generation of missile systems.</p>
<p>The United States confirmed in September 2021 it had tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon. The next year, the U.S. military requested $3.8 billion to develop hypersonic weapons, plus another $246.9 million for hypersonic defense research. U.S. hypersonic weapons can be armed with additional warheads.</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service <a class="wsw__a" href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11991#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20Army's%20Long%2DRange%20Hypersonic%20Weapon?&amp;text=This%20land%2Dbased%2C%20truck%2D,over%203%2C800%20miles%20per%20hour.">describes</a> the U.S. Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon as "a ground-launched missile equipped with a hypersonic glide body and <strong>associated</strong> transport, support, and fire control equipment." The Army says such weapons are designed to "reach the top of Earth's atmosphere" and remain just out of reach of missile defense systems.</p>

            <title>Study Finds Small Plastic Pieces in Bottled Water  (2024/1/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">17 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>The average liter of bottled water has nearly a quarter million invisible pieces of very small plastic known as nanoplastics, a recent study says.</p>
<p>Researchers found the nanoplastics with a microscope using dual lasers.</p>
<p>Scientists long figured there were lots of these very small plastic pieces. But until researchers at Columbia and Rutgers universities did their calculations, they never knew how many or what kind.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Tourists fill plastic bottles with water from a public fountain at the Sforzesco Castle, in Milan, Italy, June 25, 2022. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/196e0687-74a6-4527-8f6d-d000d45c82f6_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Tourists fill plastic bottles with water from a public fountain at the Sforzesco Castle, in Milan, Italy, June 25, 2022. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)</span></div>
<p>Looking at five <strong>samples</strong> each of three common bottled water <strong>brands</strong>, researchers found particle levels ranged from 110,000 to 400,000 per liter. The average was around 240,000, the study said. The research appeared recently in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pnas.org/" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</a></p>
<p>Nanoparticles are particles that are less than a micron in size. In comparison, a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33905616/#:~:text=The%20diameter%20of%20each%20hair,caliper%20measurement%20was%2053.32%20%C2%B5m." target="_blank">human hair is about 83 microns wide.</a></p>
<p>Previous studies have looked at slightly bigger microplastics that range from 5 millimeters, which could be seen by human eyes, to one micron. About 10 to 100 times more nanoplastics than microplastics were discovered in bottled water, the study found.</p>
<p>Much of the plastic seems to be coming from the bottle and the filtration system to clean the water itself, said the study's lead writer Naixin Qian of Columbia University.</p>
<p>She would not name the three brands because researchers want more samples and they want to study more brands. Still, she said they were common and bought at a Walmart, a popular store in the U.S.</p>
<p>Researchers still cannot answer the big question: Are those nanoplastic pieces harmful to health?</p>
<p>"That's currently under<strong> review</strong>. We don't know if it's dangerous or how dangerous," said study co-writer Phoebe Stapleton of Rutgers University. "We do know that they are getting into the tissues (of mammals, including people) ... and the current research is looking at what they're doing in the cells."</p>
<p>The International Bottled Water Association said in a statement: "There currently is both a lack of <strong>standardized</strong> (measuring) methods and no scientific" agreement on the possible health effects of nano- and microplastic particles. The statement added, "Therefore, media reports about these particles in drinking water do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers."</p>
<p>The American Chemistry Council, which represents plastics manufacturers, declined to immediately comment.</p>
<p>The Associated Press spoke with four co-writers of the study. All of them said they would cut back on their bottled water use.</p>
<p>Columbia chemist Wei Min said he has reduced his bottled water use by half. Stapleton said she now depends more on filtered water at home in New Jersey.</p>
<p>But study co-author Beizhan Yan, a Columbia environmental chemist who increased his <strong>tap water </strong>usage, pointed out that filters themselves can be a problem by introducing plastics.</p>
<p>"There's just no win," Stapleton said.</p>
<p>Outside experts, who praised the study, agreed that there is a general unease about the risks of fine plastic particles. Still, it is too early to say anything certain about the risks.</p>
<p>"The danger of the plastics themselves is still an unanswered question. For me, the additives are the most concerning," said Jason Somarelli of Duke University in North Carolina. Somarelli was not part of the research. He added, "We and others have shown that these nanoplastics can be<strong> internalized</strong> into cells, and we know that nanoplastics carry all kinds of chemical additives that could cause cell stress, DNA damage and change <strong>metabolism</strong> or cell function."</p>
<p>Somarelli said his own research has found more than 100 "known cancer-causing chemicals in these plastics."</p>
<p><strong>Dual laser microscope </strong></p>
<p>About 15 years ago, Min invented dual laser microscope technology that identifies specific compounds by their chemical properties and how they respond when exposed to lasers. Yan and Qian talked to him about using that technique to find and identify plastics that had been too small for researchers using established methods.</p>
<p>Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association said "the work can be an important advance in the <strong>detection</strong> of nanoplastics," but she said she'd like to see other chemists use the technique and get the same results.</p>
<p>Yan said he is starting to study water supplies in the U.S. cities of Boston, St. Louis, Los Angeles and elsewhere to see how much plastics are in their tap water. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5283" target="_blank">Previous studies</a> looking for microplastics and some early tests suggest there may be less nanoplastic in tap water than in bottled water.</p>
<p>Even with unknowns about human health, Yan said he does have one suggestion: Use reusable bottles instead of single-use plastics.</p>

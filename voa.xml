        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">07 January 2024</span><br/>
<p>A series of new space <strong>missions</strong> are planned for the coming year. Here is a look ahead at some of the ones to watch out for in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Artemis II</strong></p>
<p>The American space agency NASA launched its first flight in the Artemis program in 2022. That mission, called Artemis I, sent the Orion spacecraft on a trip to fly around the moon.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration shows NASA's new rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), in its Block 1 crew vehicle setup that will send astronauts to the Moon on the Artemis missions. For the rocket's first flight on the Artemis I mission, it will send an uncrewed Ori" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/AA0FC6C3-72C8-4326-BB20-8D8BC2BA7A3E_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This illustration shows NASA's new rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), in its Block 1 crew vehicle setup that will send astronauts to the Moon on the Artemis missions. For the rocket's first flight on the Artemis I mission, it will send an uncrewed Ori</span></div>
<p>Artemis aims to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since NASA's Apollo 17 mission in 1972.</p>
<p>Artemis I was a test of the Orion spacecraft, or capsule, as well as NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that carried it into space. That mission sent Orion more than 400,000 kilometers away from Earth and completed a close fly-by of the moon. NASA officials declared Artemis I a huge success.</p>
<p>NASA plans to launch Artemis II in late 2024. It is expected to take the same path that Artemis I took around the moon, but this time it will be carrying four NASA astronauts aboard Orion.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/#artemis">says</a> Artemis II aims "to confirm all of the spacecraft's systems operate as designed with crew aboard in the actual environment of deep space."</p>
<p><strong>Moon lander launches</strong></p>
<p>While Artemis II will not complete a landing, several other lunar landers are expected to touch down on the moon's surface in 2024.</p>
<p>The first of these launches is planned for January 8. It involves a lander named Peregrine. The 1.9-meter-tall spacecraft is made by the private, American space company Astrobotic Technology. It will launch aboard a Vulcan Centaur rocket, made by United Launch Alliance (ULA).</p>
<p>Peregrine is expected to carry 20 research experiments to the moon for seven countries. It will aim to land in an area known as Sinus Viscositatis. NASA says the area sits next to the Gruithuisen Domes, the largest dark spot on the near side of the moon.</p>
<p>Another Astrobotic lander, called Griffin, is set to launch to the moon's south pole in late 2024. It will be carrying an exploring robot, or rover, called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viper/">VIPER</a>. VIPER is designed to search for water sources on the moon.</p>
<p>In addition to those, American space company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/lunar-access-services">Intuitive Machines</a> is providing two landers to NASA expected for launches next year.</p>
<p>Japan will also attempt to become the fifth nation to reach the surface of the moon in mid-January. The country's space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/what-is-the-goal-of-japan-s-new-moon-mission-/7259385.html">launched</a> the spacecraft, called SLIM, in September. SLIM's mission goal is to test the possibility that spacecraft can land on very specific targets.</p>
<p><strong>ESA's Hera mission</strong></p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to launch its <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera">Hera</a> spacecraft in October on a mission to return to an <strong>asteroid</strong> system visited by NASA's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/new-studies-show-nasa-s-asteroid-crash-test-was-highly-successful/6998173.html">DART spacecraft</a> in 2022. Hera is designed to collect data on the targeted system, called Didymos. The spacecraft is expected to closely examine the physical properties of Didymos and measure detailed effects of DART's crash.</p>
<p><strong>Europa Clipper</strong></p>
<p>NASA hopes to launch its <a class="wsw__a" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/">Europa Clipper</a> mission in October. This orbiter is designed to carry out close examinations of Jupiter's moon Europa. Specifically, the mission will look for signs that the icy moon might hold the right conditions to support life. NASA says the orbiter will fly in orbit around Jupiter and "perform repeated close flybys of the ice moon."</p>
<p><strong>Boeing's Starliner test flight</strong></p>
<p>NASA and Boeing have said they plan to launch the first crewed test flight of the company's Starliner spacecraft. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/tag/starliner-spacecraft/">says</a> it is targeting March 2024 to have Starliner ready for flight. A launch date is to be set later.</p>
<p>The spacecraft completed its first uncrewed flight test to the International Space Station (ISS) last May. But Boeing has experienced several technical difficulties with Starliner during the mission and has worked with NASA to fix the problems as it prepares for the planned crewed flight.</p>
<p><strong>SpaceX Starship test</strong></p>
<p>SpaceX, another NASA partner, has been successfully using its rockets and spacecraft to transport astronauts and materials to the ISS since 2020. But the company will be seeking a successful test flight in 2024 for its super-heavy Starship spacecraft.</p>
<p>SpaceX experienced two failed Starship tests in 2023 – one in April and the other in November – which resulted in explosions. The April blast <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/spacex-s-test-of-huge-rocket-causes-major-damage-to-launch-structure/7069480.html">caused major damage</a> to the launch structure in the state of Texas. SpaceX has said it has been examining the issues related to the explosions and plans to carry out another test of Starship as soon as possible. But it will have to wait until the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) completes its investigation of the launch site damage and approves a new test.</p>

            <title>Consumer Reports Finds ‘Widespread’ Plastics in Food  (2024/1/8)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>

<p>New research from the American non-profit organization Consumer Reports finds that plastics have a "widespread" presence in food. The group called on the United States government to examine<strong> </strong>the safety of food that comes into contact with plastics during production.</p>
<p>In a report released Thursday, Consumer Reports said that 84 out of 85 food products it recently tested contained "plasticizers" called phthalates. Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic last longer.</p>
<p>The tested food came from <strong>supermarkets </strong>and restaurants.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Various plastic goods weighing 3.15 kilograms, which is equivalent to the amount of plastic that someone could eat in ten years, are displayed on a table in this illustration taken in Tokyo, Japan, March 31, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Illustration)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-efb1-08dc0e001d87_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Various plastic goods weighing 3.15 kilograms, which is equivalent to the amount of plastic that someone could eat in ten years, are displayed on a table in this illustration taken in Tokyo, Japan, March 31, 2020. (REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Illustration)</span></div>
<p>The researchers also said 79 percent of the foods examined contained bisphenol A (BPA), another chemical found in plastic, and other bisphenols. But levels were lower than in tests done in 2009.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports said all the phthalate levels were within limits set by U.S. and European regulators. However, this does not mean the chemicals are safe to eat. Deciding acceptable levels for such chemicals in food is tricky. Officials in the U.S. and Europe have set limits for only bisphenol A (BPA) and a few phthalates. All the foods tested remained within the limits, the experts said.</p>
<p>However, does that mean it is safe to eat? The researchers say no.</p>
<p>Tunde Akinleye was the lead scientist in the food testing. He says many of the limits on the chemicals are not in line with the most current scientific knowledge, he reported.</p>
<p>"We don't feel <strong>comfortable</strong> saying these levels are okay," Akinleye said.</p>
<p>Phthalates and bisphenols can interfere with the body's production and release of estrogen and other hormones. That can lead to increased risk of birth <strong>defects</strong>, cancer, diabetes, reproductive problems, developmental disorders, and other health conditions.</p>
<p>Among the tested supermarket foods, Annie's Organic Cheesy Ravioli contained the most phthalates. Del Monte peaches and Chicken of the Sea pink salmon also were high in phthalates.</p>
<p>Increased phthalate levels were also found in products including Cheerios, Gerber baby food and Yoplait yogurt. And the researchers found increased levels in hamburger, chicken and potatoes from fast food restaurants Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports also found some wide differences in levels among similar products. For example, some chicken from McDonald's contained four times more phthalates than a similar chicken product from Wendy's.</p>
<p>"That tells us that, as widespread as these chemicals are, there are ways to reduce how much is in our foods," said James Rogers. He supervises Consumer Reports' product safety testing.</p>
<p>Polar raspberry lime seltzer was the only tested product containing no phthalates.</p>
<p>General Mills produces brands including Annie's, Cheerios and Yoplait. The company did not immediately answer requests for comment. Burger King and Wendy's also did not immediately answer such requests.</p>
<p>Chicken of the Sea and Del Monte said they do not add phthalates to their food, and that their suppliers guarantee the same.</p>
<p>Del Monte added that phthalates are "widespread in the environment."</p>
<p>Gerber and McDonald's said they follow government rules connected to their products and require testing for food packaging as well.</p>

<p>Joyce Loaiza lives alone in a community for older people in the American state of Florida. When she is home, the retired office worker often talks with a friendly female voice that asks about her day.</p>
<p>A few kilometers away, the same voice helped 83-year-old Deanna Dezern when her friend died. In New York state, it plays games and music for 92-year-old Marie Broadbent. And in Washington state, it helps 83-year-old Jan Worrell make new friends.</p>
<p>The women are some of the first in the United States to receive the robot ElliQ made by Intuition Robotics. The company and other officials say it is the only device using <strong>artificial</strong> <strong>intelligence</strong> (AI) to help older Americans from loneliness.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Joyce Loazia interacts with ElliQ, left, a tabletop device that uses artificial intelligence to conduct human-like conversations, during an interview in her apartment in a senior community in Coral Springs, Florida, on December 5, 2023.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)</span></div>
<p>"It's entertaining. You can <strong>actually</strong> talk to her," said Loaiza who is 81. Her ElliQ calls her "Jellybean" for no clear reason. She said, "She'll make comments like, ‘I would go outside if I had hands, but I can't hold an <strong>umbrella</strong>.'"</p>
<p>The device looks like a small table light and it has an eyeless, mouthless head that lights up and turns. It remembers each user's interests and their talks, helping create a special experience with each new discussion. They can be as deep as the meaning of life or as light as a small joke.</p>
<p>ElliQ also plays music and provides creative or spiritual sayings. On a video screen that comes with it, it will show different cities and places of interest. The device leads exercises, asks about the owner's health, and gives reminders to take medicines and drink water. It can also support video calls and contact family, friends, or doctors in an emergency.</p>
<p>Intuition Robotics says none of the conversations are heard by the company, with the information staying on each owner's device.</p>
<p>Intuition Robotics chief executive office Dor Skuler said the idea for ElliQ came before he launched his Israeli company eight years ago. His grandfather who lost his partner needed an aide, but the first did not work out. The next person, though, understood his grandfather's love of music and his special sense of humor.</p>
<p>Skuler then thought a robot could fill the space of a friend by <strong>adapting</strong> to each person and their interests. He said, "That just did not exist anywhere."</p>
<p>The average user <strong>interacts</strong> with ElliQ more than 30 times a day and more than 90 percent report lower levels of loneliness, Skuler said.</p>
<p>The robots are mostly sent out by state agencies in New York, Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Washington. But they can also be bought individually for $600 a year plus $250 to set it up. Skuler would not say how many ElliQs have been sent out so far, but the goal is to have more than 100,000 out within five years.</p>
<p>Brigham Young University professor Julianne Holt-Lunstad studies the effects of loneliness on health. Holt-Lunstad worries that a device like ElliQ might have short-term helpful effects but it could make people less likely to seek human contact. She told <em>The Associated Press</em> that the difficult feeling of loneliness should push people to reconnect socially.</p>
<p>Skuler and state officials agreed that ElliQ is not a replacement for human contact. But some older people cannot leave home or do not have many friends.</p>
<p>Greg Olsen is director of the New York State Office for the Aging. His office has sent out 750 of the 900 ElliQs it received. He said he wished that he could "make a person show up at the home of one of the many, many older adults that don't have any family or friends."</p>
<p>Charlotte Mather-Taylor is director of the Broward County, Florida, Area Agency on Aging. She said the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath left many older people more disconnected. Her agency has provided 300 ElliQs which, she believes, help the situation.</p>
<p>She said, "We've seen very <strong>positive</strong> results with it. People generally like her and she makes them smile and brings <strong>joy</strong>."</p>

<p>Sunny is a proud Singaporean citizen who follows the laws of her country. Mostly, anyway. For the last three years, she has been illegally sheltering a cat called Mooncake.</p>
<p>A 34-year-old Singaporean law bars cats from government-built housing. Such housing is where most of the city-state's population lives - and Mooncake too, although secretly.</p>
<p>Luckily for Sunny and her cat, Singapore plans to end the feline ban later this year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Owner Sunny Leong, 30, gives cat treats to her Ragdoll cat, Mooncake, in her Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Singapore December 19, 2023.

(REUTERS/Edgar Su)</span></div>
<p>The legal change will free Sunny from the threat of a $3,007 fine or her pet's possible removal.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old works in marketing and asked to be identified only by her first name for the security of her cat. She did not want to risk officials removing Sunny from her care.</p>
<p>She wonders about the reasoning behind the ban.</p>
<p>"Cats are so much quieter than dogs. If they allow dogs, I don't understand why not cats."</p>
<p>Officials rarely enforce the ban. And the law is only for the high-rise Housing and Development Board (HDB) buildings. Eighty percent of Singapore's 3.6 million people live in the buildings.</p>
<p>The ban does, however, make life difficult for cat owners. One problem they face is health care for their animals. Medical insurance cannot be provided for illegal pets.</p>
<p>Lawmaker Louis Ng campaigned to end the ban. He said the law sometimes becomes part of disputes between neighbors.</p>
<p>"A lot of times, the cats are <strong>collateral</strong> when there's neighborly disputes," he said. One neighbor will threaten to tell police about another neighbor's cat.</p>
<p>Established in 1960, the HDB plan sells government-built housing directly to citizens for 99-year special agreements. The policy has led to one of the world's highest home-ownership rates. Still, people who live in the buildings are subject to many restrictions and laws.</p>
<p>Cats were permitted in HDB apartments until 1989 when lawmakers changed the housing law. On its website, the HDB says cats are difficult to keep contained in individual homes. It also says that cats drop hairs and other body waste in public areas and can be loud.</p>
<p>It is not clear what made the Singapore government decide to end the cat ban. But a 2022 government public opinion study may have been the turning point. The study results showed 9 out of 10 Singaporeans believed that cats were fit to keep as pets, including in HDB buildings.</p>
<p>Officials are requesting public input on a proposed cat management policy.</p>
<p>Dogs have not been subject to a similar ban, but they are limited to one per household. And, only some kinds of dogs are permitted.</p>
<p>Market research company Euromonitor International has predicted a big increase in cat ownership. It estimated Singapore's current pet population at around 94,000 cats and 113,000 dogs.</p>
<p>Lawmaker Ng, who ran an animal aid group before joining parliament in 2015, also hopes the change will lead more people to adopt rescued cats.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, HDB homeowners would be limited to two pet cats. The rules also require owners to register their pets with the government. The owners must also get special identifying electronic devices for the animals. And, owners must install protective devices on windows so cats do not get out.</p>
<p>Some cat lovers say the new laws do not go far enough.</p>
<p>Thenuga Vijakumar from the Cat Welfare Society wants the law to require <strong>sterilization</strong>. Another cat rescuer, Chan Chow Wah, urges officials to punish irresponsible owners. He said he had to take care of a cat that fell from a high window in one home. The owners refused to pay its medical bills. Wah also took care of another cat that was abandoned because he had heart disease.</p>
<p>"I end up taking over these cases. Basically, I look after them until they pass away," said Chan, estimating he spent $45,100 on cat medical expenses in 2022.</p>
<p>But for many cat owners the law will bring peace of mind.</p>
<p>Including Mooncake's: "I think it's a good thing and it's a step forward after 30 years," Sunny said.</p>

<p>Harvard University's Claudine Gay recently became the second Ivy League president to step down under pressure from <strong>alumni</strong>, political activists and supporters of the University.</p>
<p>Gay was the first Black president of Harvard and second woman to lead the university. She started the job only six months ago.</p>
<p>Gay and two other presidents were widely criticized after making controversial comments to the U.S. Congress in December.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Harvard University President Claudine Gay speaks during a hearing of the House Committee on Education on Capitol Hill, Dec. 5, 2023, in Washington.

Gay resigned Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)</span></div>
<p>Gay, along with Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, were called to Washington to discuss American lawmakers' concerns about antisemitism on college <strong>campuses</strong>. Antisemitism is the hatred of Jewish people.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education chose the presidents because their schools had "been at the center of the rise in antisemitic protests," a committee spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The protests were related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>Harvard graduate Elise Stefanik of New York is part of the Republican-led committee. She asked each university leader about how their school would react to calls to kill large numbers of Jews, something described as genocide.</p>
<p>Stefanik asked Magill: "Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or <strong>code of conduct</strong>? Yes or no?" Penn is the University of Pennsylvania, a member of the Ivy League.</p>
<p>She asked the same question of Gay and Kornbluth.</p>
<p>None of the school leaders were able to clearly say calling for the death of Jews violated school rules.</p>
<p>The presidents were sharply criticized for their lack of clarity. Within a few days, influential members of the University of Pennsylvania community pushed Magill to resign.</p>
<p>For a time, it looked as if Gay's job was safe. She received support from some notable professors at Harvard, including legal scholar Laurence Tribe.</p>
<p>Tribe said "it is dangerous for universities to be ... <strong>bullied</strong> into <strong>micromanaging</strong> their policies." He was talking about the way some activists and politicians seemed to be pushing the universities toward their <strong>preferred</strong> result.</p>
<p>One of those activists is Christopher Rufo. Rufo is a member of the leadership group that oversees New College of Florida. With the support of Governor Ron DeSantis, Rufo and others have been pushing the small college to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/small-florida-college-worries-about-government-involvement/7037843.html">change its <strong>curriculum</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After Gay announced her resignation on January 2, Rufo wrote words of celebration on X, formerly known as Twitter. He and other conservatives believe American higher education has too many liberal people in leadership roles.</p>
<p>Gay's position at Harvard looked safe in December. So what changed?</p>
<p>In the weeks following the congressional hearing, some critics charged Gay with using "duplicative language" in academic writing. To duplicate means to make an exact copy of something.</p>
<p>They also said Gay had plagiarized -- or claimed others' writing as her own.</p>
<p>The charges, however, did not come from those working in higher education. They came from people like Rufo who are working to push out higher education leaders they do not agree with.</p>
<p>At first, Harvard said it did not consider Gay's work to be "intentional or <strong>reckless</strong>." But pressure continued.</p>
<p>Many observers believe the conservative activists felt Gay only received Harvard's presidency because she was a Black woman.</p>
<p>On X, Rufo wrote that he was establishing a "plagiarism hunting fund" as a way to oust university leaders and bring attention to the "<strong>rot</strong> in the Ivy League."</p>
<p>Gay wrote a letter to the Harvard community announcing she was leaving her position "with a heavy heart." She also said it was frightening to be attacked due to her race. Gay said she would remain at Harvard as a professor.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism complaints as a tool</strong></p>
<p>Academic experts who have been following the pressure campaign on Gay say the plagiarism accusations only came after it looked like she would not lose her job.</p>
<p>They worry that people who do not like the leaders of major American universities will now research their academic writing in search of duplications and poor citations.</p>
<p>Davarian Baldwin is a historian at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He writes about race and higher education. Baldwin said Gay made mistakes in her writing and noted that anti-plagiarism software will make it easy for critics to find problematic writing by college leaders and professors.</p>
<p>The tools are designed to help educators learn whether their students' writings are their own. But Baldwin said the tools can be dangerous if they fall into the hands of people who want to argue that academia is full of corrupt and incompetent people. Incompetent means someone lacks the ability to do something well.</p>
<p>Irene Mulvey is president of the American Association of University Professors. She said plagiarism investigations could be "weaponized" to push out presidents.</p>
<p>She said she is concerned that conservative activists will use the successful campaign against Gay as a method to push out other academic leaders.</p>
<p>"For presidents to be taken down like this, it does not <strong>bode</strong> <strong>well</strong> for academic freedom," she said.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today, let's talk about a common art activity – coloring.</p>
<p>Coloring books are common objects of play and learning for children around the world. In recent years, coloring books for adults have grown popular too.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A dandelion crayon character poses for photos during a Crayola event in New York's Times Square, March 31, 2017. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/66C958B8-DA6D-4173-BAC7-63478F1ED3C9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A dandelion crayon character poses for photos during a Crayola event in New York's Times Square, March 31, 2017.

<p>Children usually color with wax sticks called crayons. But, you can also use color markers, pens, and pencils.</p>
<p>Adding color to black and white images is fun and often calming. You just choose a color and fill in the space created by the lines. In fact, children are often taught to stay inside the lines when they color.</p>
<p>Apparently, this idea does not come naturally. Child development experts say very young children begin by <strong>scribbling</strong> on a coloring page. They do not pay attention to the lines of the picture. The result is a colorful but often <strong>messy</strong> looking picture.</p>
<p>Then between the ages of two and five they start coloring inside the lines. This progression shows an improvement in many skills: fine motor skills, hand-eye <strong>coordination</strong>, space and object <strong>awareness</strong>, and more.</p>
<p>Many children are taught to color inside the lines. As a result, many adults do the same. This makes this finished artwork look more organized and proper because you followed the images' guide lines.</p>
<p>That is why the expression <u>coloring inside the lines</u> means to think or act within generally accepted guidelines. If you color inside the lines, you follow the rules. You <u>stay in the lines</u> or you <u>play by the book</u> (not the coloring book ... but the rule book).</p>
<p>We can also say you <u>stick to the script</u>. A script contains the spoken words performers must say out-loud in a play, movie, or show. Sticking to the script means you do not change the lines you are given.</p>
<p>Such people can also be said to <u>toe the line</u>. That expression comes from foot racing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who <u>color outside the lines</u> do not follow rules. They are rebels. Rebels reject rules. They color outside the lines and <u>think outside the box</u>. Instead of sticking to the script they <u>go off script</u>. They <strong>improvise</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as with rule-followers, we have just as many word phrases and expressions for rule-breakers. They<u> break new ground</u>. They are ground-breakers. They <strong><u>buck</u></strong><u> traditions.</u> Used as a verb this way, "buck" means to oppose or resist.</p>
<p>Next time you want describe these two kinds of people you will have plenty of expressions to choose from!</p>
<p>And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo!</p>

<p>Few players of the online video game Free Fire know that one of their top opponents is an 81-year-old grandmother from rural Chile.</p>
<p>From her professional gaming chair at home in a small village, Maria Elena Arevalo becomes a hunter. She shoots down opponents in a game in which tens of millions of players fight to survive on an imaginary island.</p>
<p>Arevalo does not look like her online <strong>character</strong> "Mami Nena." That is the <strong>nickname</strong> she got from her only grandson, Hector Carrasco who is 20.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mar&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;237;a Elena Ar&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;233;valo, 81, plays Free Fire, a popular online video game, at home at her home in Llay-Llay, Valparaiso Region, Chile, on Dec. 19, 2023. (Photo by Pablo Vera / AFP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3777-08dc082fad3b_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Mar<i>&amp;#</i>237;a Elena Ar<i>&amp;#</i>233;valo, 81, plays Free Fire, a popular online video game, at home at her home in Llay-Llay, Valparaiso Region, Chile, on Dec. 19, 2023. (Photo by Pablo Vera / AFP)</span></div>
<p>It was Carrasco who introduced Arevalo to the digital world of gaming. It has given her a new excitement for life after falling into deep loneliness following the death of her husband of 56 years in 2020.</p>
<p>"I didn't even know what a <strong>mouse</strong> was," she told AFP at her home in the town of Llay-Llay in central Chile.</p>
<p>"Afterwards, I got excited. We started to play whenever [Carrasco] could. I felt better because I didn't think so much about my late husband anymore."</p>
<p>At first "I didn't want to hurt anyone," she added, but with time, she grew more competitive.</p>
<p>Today, Arevalo plays at the "Heroic" level. That is just one level below the highest "Grandmaster" level, which only 300 players compete in. She has 4 million followers on social media service TikTok and 650,000 on YouTube, where she shares tips with fellow players.</p>
<p>Last year, she visited Mexico City as a Free Fire ambassador for the game's anniversary celebrations. The cost-free trip was her first outside of Chile.</p>
<p>"All the kids asked me for <strong>autographs</strong>...It was beautiful. The day I die, I'll take that with me," she said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Arevalo was named one of Chile's 100 most important older people by the <em>El Mercurio</em> newspaper and the Catholic University for helping break down age <strong>stereotypes</strong>.</p>
<p>"It's totally cool, and...I feel like she's like my best friend," Carrasco said of his famous grandmother.</p>
<p>Three years after starting to play Free Fire, Arevalo said she no longer feels lonely. But a recent study found that nearly half of people over 80 in Chile say they feel lonely.</p>
<p>Older people are finding comfort in gaming. For example, a Ukrainian team known as "Young Guard" are strong Counter Strike competitors. A 93-year-old Japanese named Hamako Mori is thought to be the oldest gamer in the world. She is also known by her alias Gamer Grandma.</p>
<p>For Arevalo, gaming is becoming harder for her because of a worsening skin condition. But she is not planning to slow down.</p>
<p>"I love doing this. I'll keep going as far as I can," she said.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Donald Trump, the 45th U.S. president. He was elected in 2016. Because his presidency is so new, this program will not discuss his time in office.</p>
<p>Instead, it will discuss his early life.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Donald Trump" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-cd80-08dbfb46f4ba_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Donald Trump</span></div>
<p>And it will note a few ways that Trump's background is unusual compared to most U.S. presidents.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Donald Trump was born in Queens, a <strong>borough</strong> of New York City. He was the fourth child. He had two brothers and two sisters.</p>
<p>His mother had been born in Scotland. His father, whose relatives were German, became a successful businessman in New York.</p>
<p>Donald and his two brothers helped their father in the family business. At the time, the business was called Elizabeth Trump and Son, after his grandmother and father. The work related to building, buying, and managing property.</p>
<p>By his <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decades-later-disagreement-over-young-trumps-military-academy-post/2016/01/09/907a67b2-b3e0-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html?utm_term=.6adc0c8e23c5">own telling</a>, young Donald often created trouble in school. So when he was 13 years old, his parents sent him to a military-style school.</p>
<p>Donald said that, for the most part, he enjoyed the experience. Other students there remembered him as a good baseball player, as popular with girls, and as someone who wanted to succeed.</p>
<p>Trump went on to college first at Fordham University in New York, and then at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned a degree in economics.</p>
<p>He was also already investing in real estate. After he graduated, Trump quickly returned to New York City and his career.</p>
<p>In time, he became the head of the family business. He re-named it the Trump Organization. As its president, Trump developed and put his name on luxury buildings, casinos, hotels, and golf courses around the world.</p>
<p>Later, he became linked to the entertainment industry, too. He became a part owner of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.missuniverse.com/missusa/competition" target="_blank">beauty pageants</a>, hosted a <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364782/" target="_blank">television show</a>, and wrote a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1032.Trump" target="_blank">book</a> about how to succeed in business.</p>
<p>During those years, Trump also married three times and divorced twice. The media <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-family-life-654724" target="_blank">wrote</a> especially about his first and second marriages because he openly had a relationship with his second wife while he was married to his first.</p>
<p>In 2005, he married <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/melania-trump/">Melania Knauss</a>, a former <strong>model</strong> from Slovenia. She is only the second first lady who was not born in the United States. The first was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/meet-the-first-and-only-foreign-born-first-lady-louisa-cathernine-adams-180959149/">Louisa Adams</a>, who came from Britain in 1801.</p>
<p>All together, Trump has three sons and two daughters.</p>
<p>Because Trump has been a public figure for most of his life, many Americans were familiar with him before he ran for president.</p>
<p>To some, he is linked to success in business and <strong>branding</strong>.</p>
<p>To others, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://millercenter.org/president/trump/life-presidency">notes</a> journalist Jackie Calmes, he is linked to <strong>debt</strong> and legal battles.</p>
<p>But, until he officially entered the 2016 campaign as a Republican candidate, few linked him to politics.</p>
<p>Trump is <a class="wsw__a" href="#https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/08/donald-trump-experience-president/93504134/">unusual</a> among past presidents in that he had never worked in the government before. Nor has Trump served in the military. Only Presidents <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-zachary-taylor/3836070.html" target="_blank">Taylor</a>, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-ulysses-grant/3920036.html" target="_blank">Grant</a>, and<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-dwight-eisenhower/4076083.html" target="_blank"> Eisenhower</a> had no past government experience; however, they had all been generals.</p>
<p>During the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/trump-republican-nomination/3429185.html">campaign</a> for president, other candidates spent money to buy advertising. But Trump spread his message on free television, radio and social media.</p>
<p>Trump won the Republican nomination over 16 candidates. He went on to defeat Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump was 70 years old when he was sworn in.</p>
<p>Trump was unusual in how he communicated with the public. As a president, he continued to use Twitter, now known as X, to communicate his thoughts directly to anyone who wanted to follow him.</p>
<p>Many earlier presidents also used changes in technology to interact with the public. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-president-woodrow-wilson/4001252.html" target="_blank">Woodrow Wilson</a> was the first to hold press conferences regularly with reporters. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-franklin-roosevelt/4046663.html" target="_blank">Franklin Roosevelt</a> famously spoke to Americans on the radio. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-john-kennedy/4085635.html" target="_blank">John F. Kennedy</a> – and later <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-richard-nixon/4107568.html" target="_blank">Richard Nixon</a> – are credited with using television to their advantage.</p>
<p>While the long-term effects of Trump's presidency are not yet known, he will likely be remembered in part for his direct and <strong>unscripted</strong> style of communication.</p>

            <title>Ahead of Lunar New Year, Chinese Debate Fireworks Ban  (2024/1/6) | 春节前夕烟花爆竹禁燃令引发国人热议</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Chinese lawmakers recently entered a fierce online debate on whether fireworks should be used to celebrate the Lunar New year this February. They said a total ban on fireworks in the country credited with inventing the noisemakers would be hard to enforce.<br/>
中国立法者最近加入了网上一场对今年2月是否应该燃放烟花爆竹庆祝农历新年的激烈辩论。他们表示，全面禁止燃放烟花爆竹在一个被认为发明了这种热闹玩意的国家将很难执行。</p>
<p>Lawmakers said air pollution prevention and fire safety laws have led to "differences in understanding" of the ban on fireworks. However, it was never a total ban.<br/>
立法者表示，大气污染防治和消防安全法导致了对烟花爆竹禁令的“理解分歧”。然而，它从来都不是一项全面的禁令。</p>
<p>In 2017, official data showed 444 cities had banned fireworks. Since then, some of the cities have loosened the bans. They permit fireworks at certain times of the year and at special places.<br/>
官方数据显示，2017年有444个城市禁止燃放烟花爆竹。从那时起，一些城市放松了禁令。他们允许在一年中的特定时间和特殊地点燃放烟花。</p>
<p>This month, however, many counties made announcements banning fireworks, restarting discussion on the ban.<br/>
然而，本月许多县宣布禁止燃放烟花爆竹，重新引发了有关禁令的讨论。</p>
<p>"We've the right to fireworks," wrote a user of Weibo, a popular Chinese online discussion service.<br/>
“我们有权利燃放烟花，”中国流行的在线讨论网站微博的一位用户写道。</p>
<p>Chinese folklore says the earliest fireworks were invented 2,000 years ago to drive away the "nian." The nian, the story goes, was a monster that hunted people and animals before the Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival.<br/>
中国民间传说称，最早的烟花是2000年前发明用来驱赶“年兽”。据说，年兽是一种在农历新年或春节前猎杀人和动物的怪物。</p>
<p>Since then, fireworks came to be used to celebrate other events.<br/>
从那时起，烟花开始被用来庆祝其他活动。</p>
<p>Some Chinese say the fireworks bans were necessary to protect the environment.<br/>
一些中国人说，为了保护环境，禁止燃放烟花爆竹是必要的。</p>
<p>An online opinion study by the official Beijing Youth Daily found that over 80 percent of people supported fireworks during Spring Festival. The festival is the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar.<br/>
官方的《北京青年报》在网上进行的一项民意调查发现，超过80%的人支持春节期间燃放烟花爆竹。这个节日是中国日历上最重要的节日。</p>
<p>Some also said the ban was ironic after the United Nations recently named the Spring Festival an official holiday, a move supported by Chinese officials.<br/>
一些人还表示，这项禁令颇具讽刺意味，因为联合国最近将春节定为官方节日，这一举措得到了中国官员的支持。</p>
<p>"The Spring Festival belongs to the world, but China's is almost gone," wrote another Weibo user.<br/>
另一位微博用户写道：“春节属于世界，但中国的春节（传统）几乎已经消失了。”</p>
<p>Southern Hunan province is a worldwide supplier of fireworks. Its exports totaled $579 million from January to November, state media reported. That number is far greater than domestic sales.<br/>
湖南省是世界性的烟花供应商。据官方媒体报道，今年1月到11月，湖南烟花出口总额为5.79亿美元。这个数字远远超过国内销售额。</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Uganda are considering barring people from making a popular alcoholic drink at home.</p>
<p>The bill being considered would affect people like the Ndyanabo family.</p>
<p>At least once a week, Girino Ndyanabo's family gathers around a hole in the ground where bananas have been left to <strong>ripen</strong>. The family then <strong>peels</strong> the bananas and puts them into a wooden container shaped like a boat. The father steps in with his bare feet. The sweet banana juice he presses out is then <strong>filtered</strong>. To this he adds sorghum. The juice is then left to <strong>ferment</strong> for up to a day. This process changes the juice into an alcoholic drink.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Ndyanabo family peels bananas used for Tonto and throws them into a wooden vat carved like a boat in Mbarara, Uganda, Dec. 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-8e19-08dc0ca91945_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Ndyanabo family peels bananas used for Tonto and throws them into a wooden vat carved like a boat in Mbarara, Uganda, Dec. 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda)</span></div>
<p>The result is the home-<strong>brewed</strong> drink Ugandans call tonto, or tontomera. This word describes a drinker's poor movements.</p>
<p>Tonto is famous in Uganda. Everyone drinks it – from officials to laborers. Singers sing about it. Politicians seeking office drink it with voters. And traditional ceremonies end at sunset with tonto parties.</p>
<p>However, there are threats to the way tonto is currently produced. More people are now drinking low-cost bottled beer. Health officials want rules to limit the risks from <strong>contaminated</strong> home brews. And officials want to get tax income from the production and sale of the drink.</p>
<p>The bill in the national assembly seeks to set rules for the production and sale of alcohol. It would make the activities of home brewers of tonto a crime. It would also make the production of other traditional home brews in the East African country a crime.</p>
<p>But farmers have a more urgent concern: Not enough new banana juice <strong>cultivars</strong> are being planted to produce the drink.</p>
<p>Instead, more farmers are planting a different sort of banana. This kind is boiled and eaten as a popular dish called matooke.</p>
<p>Girino Ndyanabo farms in the western district of Mbarara. His first experience with tonto was as a little boy in the 1970s. He said he has only a few plants left of the cultivars he uses to make tonto.</p>
<p>He gets his bananas from farmers near him until he can fill the small pit on his farm. The natural underground heat ripens the bananas within days as he prepares for the weekly pressing. The event is important in the family's daily life because they sell tonto.</p>
<p>Ndyanabo said his weekly brew has regular buyers. But in recent years, he has seen both demand and supply slow. This is partly because the sale price of tonto has been largely unchanged for many years.</p>
<p>However, the process of brewing it has become more difficult. Tonto brewers must travel farther for their bananas. Also, the price of sorghum has gone up.</p>
<p>"You take a lot of time doing this work. It's not as easy as someone who cuts matooke, puts it on a bicycle and sells it for cash immediately," Ndyanabo said of the green bananas that are eaten raw by most Ugandans. The bananas used for alcohol come from very far, he added.</p>
<p>To help this situation, he has been trying to plant more of the banana juice cultivars. They grow faster. And his son, Mathias Kamukama, helps.</p>
<p>The family makes five or six 20-liter<strong> jerricans</strong> for each brewing. A jerrican's worth sells for about $8. A half-liter of tonto sells for about 27 cents, compared to 67 cents for the cheapest bottled beer.</p>
<p>Benson Muhereza is an electrician who regularly visits a small drinking place in a poor neighborhood of Mbarara.</p>
<p>"It (is) like a favorite drink when you have your lunch. It (is) like a juice. When you don't want to take beer, you come and have your tonto," Muhereza said.</p>
<p>He said it does not make him feel bad or cause his head to hurt.</p>
<p>Christine Kyomuhangi sells tonto. She said she receives two jerricans of the brew every day. She knows her business is at risk because of the bill. But she smiled, saying buyers come from all over the city.</p>
<p>"Tonto will never get finished," she added, meaning tonto will survive all of these challenges.</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Nirmala about the meaning of the word "slender."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: What Does Slender Mean? " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-8cb4-08dc0d53a6ab_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: What Does Slender Mean? </span></div>
<p>I'm Nirmala.</p>
<p>What does the word "slender" mean?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Nirmala</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Nirmala!</p>
<p>As the year starts, many people make new goals. A large number of them center on losing weight. This is a great time for this question! We will talk about the word "slender" and offer some <strong>synonyms</strong> to help you compare and understand this word better.</p>
<p><strong>Slender</strong></p>
<p>The word "slender" is an adjective.</p>
<p>The first meaning has to do with body shape. Something slender is small around, especially in comparison to its length. A slender person has no extra fat and little roundness, usually in an appealing way.</p>
<p>In other words, slender has a positive <strong>connotation </strong>when used to describe a person. The word "skinny" on the other hand, suggests an underweight condition that is not appealing.</p>
<p><em>The slender girl could walk through the narrow opening in the fence. </em></p>
<p><em>Many cultures considered a long, slender neck beautiful.</em></p>
<p>Some synonyms that you can use in place of "slender" include "slim," "lean" and "thin." These words all have a more positive association to them than "skinny." But what separates them from "slender" is the idea that "slender" also includes the association of "<strong>graceful</strong>."</p>
<p>Slender can also be used to describe non-physical things.</p>
<p><em>The mayoral candidate won by a slender number of votes. </em></p>
<p>In that sentence, slender means small.</p>
<p><em>Spending money is slender just before payday. </em></p>
<p>In that one, it means limited.</p>
<p><em>The slender glass tube was all that protected the rare <strong>sample</strong>.</em></p>
<p>In that last sentence, slender means small but also suggests a delicate, or easily breakable, quality.</p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Nirmala.</p>

<p>Some important tree species native to the northwestern states in the U.S. are no longer growing well because of climate change.</p>
<p>As conditions change in states such as Washington, Oregon and California, trees such as the Douglas fir, Western red cedar, giant sequoia and redwood may need to move -- with the help of humans.</p>
<p>Some of the trees do not do well when temperatures rise. Others suffer during times of <strong>drought</strong>. The goal is to move the trees to areas where the climate might more <strong>suitable</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - City of Bellevue Forest Management Program Supervisor Rick Bailey holds a juvenile giant sequoia in his hands on Oct. 11, 2022, in Bellevue, Wash. (AP Photo/Manuel Valdes, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/6951398f-6af4-4e04-b34b-83543276db37_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - City of Bellevue Forest Management Program Supervisor Rick Bailey holds a juvenile giant sequoia in his hands on Oct. 11, 2022, in Bellevue, Wash.

<p>Forest scientists are generally in favor of moving the trees so they do not die out. However, not all of the scientists agree on the best way to do it.</p>
<p>There are three ways to move trees: assisted population <strong>migration</strong>, assisted species migration and <strong>range</strong> expansion.</p>
<p>Assisted population migration involves scientists moving a tree's seeds within its current growing range. Assisted species migration involves scientists moving a species far from its existing area. In this case, that would include moving redwoods and sequoias from California to Washington.</p>
<p>The third way, range expansion, moves trees just outside their current growing range. Each way has different results for the trees and other animals and insects that depend on the trees.</p>
<p>Michael Case is a forest <strong>ecologist</strong> at the Nature Conservancy in Virginia. He said "there is a huge difference" among the different migration methods.</p>
<p>He said the risk of failure increases "whenever you plant something in an area where it is not <strong>locally</strong> found." He said the risk is not only to the trees. There is also the risk of causing problems in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Case is working on an assisted population migration program with Douglas fir and Western hemlock trees. He is testing whether the trees, originally from drier parts of the northwest, can do well in western Washington where there is a drought. His organization believes that assisted population migration has fewer risks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service also takes part in assisted population migration programs. Dr. David Lytle is the agency's deputy chief for research and development. He said the agency is "very very <strong>cautious</strong>" about moving plants outside of their "historic range."</p>
<p>Douglas Tallamy is a professor of entomology and wildlife ecology at the University of Delaware. He said one worry about species migration is that local caterpillars might not eat the leaves of trees that are new to the area. The caterpillars serve as food for birds and other animals, so they must have a good food source.</p>
<p>Although the concerns are documented, the city of Portland, Oregon, is working on a species migration project for 11 tree species. The project includes three oak trees: California black oak, canyon live oak and interior live oak. Tallamy said oak trees are among the most important in North America. "When you move them out of range," he said, "the things that are <strong>adapted</strong> to eating them no longer have access to them."</p>
<p>The city <strong>responded</strong> to questions from the Associated Press, and said it is using guidelines "from universities, state and federal sources" and more, in its project.</p>
<p>Another group working on species migration projects in the northwest is called PropagationNation. To propagate means to produce a new plant through the use of seeds or parts of another plant.</p>
<p>That organization is planting non-local trees around the Seattle, Washington area in hopes that they will start growing in places where Western red cedar, Western hemlock and big leaf maple are having trouble.</p>
<p>David Milarch is the leader of a group in Michigan that supports keeping old trees alive. It is called Archangel Ancient Tree Archive. Milarch said the hope is to permit redwoods and sequoias to grow in areas to the north. The hope is not to <strong>replace</strong> native trees.</p>
<p>He said his group hopes the trees "will still be here in 100 to 200 years and not join the list of trees that are going <strong>extinct</strong>."</p>
<p>The organizations that are not practicing widely accepted methods for moving species feel like the risks are worth it.</p>
<p>But Robert Slesak is not sure about either practice. He oversees population migration sites run by the U.S. Forest Service in California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>He said he has concerns about assisted species migrations and assisted population migrations that lack experimental <strong>rigor</strong>. Rigor describes an activity that has been tested with high standards.</p>
<p>He said all of the ideas about how to move trees should follow experiments that have already produced strong results.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows we need to do some kind of action related to climate, but there's a real risk of making it worse."</p>

<p>Investigators are studying what went wrong when a Japanese coast guard aircraft and a passenger jet crashed into each other on Tuesday at Haneda Airport in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Officials want to find out what caused the crash. But there are also many questions about the fire that broke out when the planes <strong>collided</strong> on the runway.</p>
<p>The body of the passenger jet, an Airbus 350, was made of carbon-<strong>composite fibers</strong>. Passenger aircraft bodies have traditionally been made of aluminum.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Japan Airlines plane is on fire on the runway of Haneda airport on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024 in Tokyo, Japan.

<p>The crash may become an important test of the safety of composite materials for some uses in aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>The crash</strong></p>
<p>Communications from air traffic control at the airport describe some of the events leading to the crash. The larger Japan Airlines (JAL) passenger jet was given permission to use the runway where the coast guard plane, a Bombardier Dash-8, was preparing for takeoff.</p>
<p>When they struck each other, an orange fireball exploded from the aircraft and the passenger jet continued down the runway covered in flames.</p>
<p>When the plane stopped, crew members and all 379 passengers slid down emergency<strong> chutes</strong> within 20 minutes. All survived. The captain of the coast guard plane got out, but five members of the crew died in the crash.</p>
<p>Safety experts are praising the airline's crew and the passengers for escaping the burning plane. The crew shouted, warning the passengers to run away from the plane.</p>
<p><strong>The composite material</strong></p>
<p>Composite materials have been used for many years inside commercial aircraft. But the first commercial plane to have its body, or fuselage, and wings reinforced with carbon fibers was the Boeing 787. It went into service in 2011. About 1,100 of the planes have been produced.</p>
<p>The Airbus A350 followed in 2018. About 570 have been sold.</p>
<p>Aircraft designers use composite materials because they strengthen plastics and other materials. Boeing says the material can save 20 percent of the weight of aluminum. The reduced weight saves fuel.</p>
<p>Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) tested the strength of composites to get <strong>certification</strong> for the 787 jet. But concerns remain about gases released from such materials when they burn.</p>
<p>John Goglia is a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aircraft accidents. He said, "There has always been a concern about composites if they catch fire." Goglia noted that the gases released when composites burn are dangerous. They can even be dangerous after the fire is put out because the fibers might remain in the air.</p>
<p>The FAA has said for more than 20 years that there are dangers related to composite materials. FAA officials say the main health dangers include sharp pieces of material, dust and poisonous gases caused by burning substances<strong> </strong>that hold the material together.</p>
<p><strong>Did it make a difference?</strong></p>
<p>Although the inside of the passenger plane filled with smoke after the explosion, all 379 passengers were able to escape.</p>
<p>John Cox, a safety expert, noted: "That fuselage protected them from a really horrific fire — it did not burn through for some period of time and let everybody get out."</p>
<p>Goglia said there is no real evidence whether composite materials or aluminum are better at resisting fire long enough to protect people.</p>
<p>However, one passenger on the JAL flight said the smoke "<strong>stung</strong>" very much.</p>
<p>Todd Curtis, a safety expert and former Boeing engineer, warned that injuries from dangerous smoke could take a long time to show up. Passengers involved in accidents usually are in shock and often do not recognize their injuries.</p>
<p>Another concern, experts noted, was the amount of time it took firefighters to put out the fire. Pictures show the JAL flight's burned wreckage near one of the runways. The body was almost completely destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>In 2013, a fire at London's Heathrow Airport involving an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 was difficult to stop. Safety expert Curtis said, "putting out the fire took much more effort that a typical airliner fire." Curtis said he worried at the time about composite fuselage fires.</p>
<p>Those concerns, he said, have not gone away.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old American boy has become the first person ever to beat the popular video game Tetris.</p>
<p>The young gamer, Willis Gibson, completed 157 levels of Tetris before the game technically surrendered.</p>
<p>Gamers call this kind of ending a "kill screen." The Tetris program had no more plays to make and so it crashed, freezing the video game.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this image taken from video, 13-year-old Willis Gibson reacts after beating the video game Tetris.

<p>Gibson lives in the Midwestern state of Oklahoma and goes by the gaming name "Blue Scuti." He can be heard repeatedly shouting "Oh my God" <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piXi6HM_GQ4">on a video</a> recording as he beat the game.</p>
<p>"I can't feel my fingers," Gibson says in the video.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>Gaming experts had long considered Tetris unbeatable. This is partly because the video game does not have a clear ending point.</p>
<p>Tetris came out in 1984 and quickly became a worldwide favorite. Its creator, Alexey Pajitnov, was a computer programs engineer at the Russian Academy of Sciences in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>During the game, players move and join together seven different shapes of falling blocks. The goal is for players to fit the blocks together to form solid lines inside a box. The blocks fall faster as players progress through higher levels of the game.</p>
<p>On December 21, Gibson reached level 157 and dropped a final piece into place. This caused a single line of blocks to disappear and the game to enter a permanent freeze.</p>
<p>"This is unbelievable," Vince Clemente, CEO of Classic Tetris World Championship, told Reuters news agency. "Developers didn't think anyone would ever make it that far and now the game has officially been beaten by a human being." </p><p>For some time, gamers have known Tetris would eventually reach an ending point and technically shut down. But in the past, only a computer program could force such a game-ending shut-down.</p>
<p>Other fans of the game were quick to share Gibson's excitement. Classic Tetris World Champion Justin Yu – who goes by the name fractal161 – declared in his own video, "He did it, he did it!"</p>
<p>Tetris chief executive Maya Rogers joined in the celebration. She said in a statement it was fitting Gibson had beat the game just ahead of 2024, when Tetris was entering its 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>"Congratulations to 'blue scuti,'" Rogers said. She added that the "extraordinary" event "<strong>defied</strong>" any previous known limits of the game.</p>
<p>Gibson uses a "rolling" controller playing method popularized in 2021. It permits players to operate the controls in different ways to be able to keep playing longer to reach higher levels.</p>

<p>Many Americans have returned to work or school as the holiday season comes to an end. Some traveled far to be with loved ones for Christmas and New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Last month, we looked at the song <em>Take Me Home, Country Roads.</em> For many people from the state of West Virginia and the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/discover-americas-appalachian-trial/2766408.html">Appalachia</a> mountains, the song reminds them of home. John Denver recorded the hit song in 1971. Lana Del Rey recently recorded her version of the song.</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will continue looking at parts of Del Rey's version of the song and connect it to grammar and <strong>figurative</strong> language.<strong> </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="More Personification and Adjectives in Take Me Home, Country Roads " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-36b8-08dc0cb9bd41_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">More Personification and Adjectives in "Take Me Home, Country Roads" </span></div>
<p>Let's look at the last section of the song.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p><em>All my memories gather 'round her</em></p>
<p><em>Miner</em><em>'s lady, stranger to blue water</em></p>
<p><em>Dark and dusty, painted on the sky</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Misty</em></strong><em> taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me</em></p>
<p><em>The radio reminds me of my home far away</em></p>
<p><em>Driving down the road, I get a feeling</em></p>
<p><em>That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday</em></p>
<p><strong>More personification </strong></p>
<p>In the first two <strong>verses </strong>of each section, West Virginia is humanized once again using personification. Personification is the humanization of a non-living thing.</p>
<p>The use of the subject and object pronouns "she" and "her" give a female quality to the state. That personification of West Virginia as a woman also appears in the <strong>chorus</strong> of the song when it is referred to as <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/grammar-and-figurative-language-in-take-me-home-country-roads-/7406288.html">"mountain mama." </a></p>
<p>"Her voice" and "she calls me" add to the female <strong>characteristics </strong>of the state.</p>
<p>"Miner's lady" and "stranger to blue water" are other personified comparisons in the song. West Virginia is known for its coal and limestone mines throughout the state. Many European immigrants came to West Virginia in the late 1800s and early 1900s to work in the mines.</p>
<p>"Stanger to blue water" is a reference to West Virginia's geographic location as a landlocked state. A stranger is an unfamiliar person. The phrase is noting that the state is not near an ocean and is unfamiliar to blue ocean waters.</p>
<p><strong>Adjectives </strong></p>
<p>And finally, we have more adjectives. Today we look at descriptive adjectives, not comparative adjectives.</p>
<p><em>Dark and dusty, painted on the sky</em></p>
<p><em>Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye</em></p>
<p>"Dark and dusty" refer to the "miner's lady" line and coal mining. Coal is a dark, natural substance found in the earth. West Virginia and other parts of the Appalachian region are rich in this resource. It also creates dusty particles that fill the air. That combination "paints" or covers the sky.</p>
<p>The line "misty taste of moonshine" also has a descriptive adjective. "Misty" has several meanings. "Mist," the noun form of the word, means water in the form of very small drops floating in the air. So, "misty" means full of mist. It can also describe something that is not clearly seen or remembered. Finally, it can describe eyes that are full of tears. In fact, "misty-eyed" means the same thing as "tearful."</p>
<p>Moonshine is a kind of alcohol that is made illegally. Making moonshine was especially common in the hills of Appalachia during Prohibition, which lasted from 1920 to 1933.</p>
<p>The alcohol was moved by car at night and the <strong>bootleggers</strong> could only see by the light of the moon. That is where it got its name.</p>
<p>It is not common to describe a taste or flavor as "misty." But there are a few possible meanings. Since "moonshine" was strong, drinking it could leave one's eyes "misty" or filled with tears. The "misty" flavor of moonshine could also refer to the illegal way of producing and transporting the alcohol without anyone knowing.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Today we looked at the rest of the song <em>Country Roads</em>. We found even more personification by comparing West Virginia to a woman with words like, "miner's lady" and "her voice."</p>
<p>We found even more adjectives that were used to describe parts of Appalachian culture like "dark and dusty" for coal mining and "misty taste of moonshine" to describe a strong alcohol flavor that could bring tears to one's eyes.</p>

<p>Japanese researchers say they have broken the world speed record for sending internet data.</p>
<p>The recent experiment involved sending data over <strong>fiber-optic</strong> lines enclosed inside <strong>cables</strong>. Fiber optic technology is currently the fastest way to transport, or transmit, internet data.</p>
<p>Fiber-optic cables use signals of light to send data over long distances. The fiber material is very thin, about one-tenth the thickness of a human hair.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Fiber optic cables are seen running into a server room at Intergate.Manhattan, a data center owned and developed by Sabey Data Center Properties, during a tour of the facility in lower Manhattan, in New York, March 20, 2013.

<p>Fiber-optic technology was meant to replace an older internet transmission method that uses cables made mainly of copper wiring. This method can also carry data over the internet, but at much reduced speeds and <strong>capacity</strong> compared with fiber-optics.</p>
<p>A report released last year by the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (ITU) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.itu.int/hub/2023/05/space-division-multiplexing/">suggested</a> current worldwide internet data transmission is reaching full capacity levels.</p>
<p>The Japanese data transmission experiment used fiber-optic cables. But the engineers involved made some changes to the cables in an effort to greatly expand speed and capacity.</p>
<p>Such methods are known as multiplexing technologies. They aim to increase the amount and speed of internet data with existing transmission equipment. These technologies combine multiple communication signals into a single transmission line.</p>
<p>One multiplexing technology – called Wave Division Multiplexing (or WDM) – aims to increase the <strong>wavelength</strong> capacity within transmission cables. Another method – called Space Division Multiplexing (or SDM) – can involve increasing the size or number of fiber-optic centers, called cores.</p>
<p>Engineers from Japan's National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NCIT) led the researchers who carried out the experiment. The tests measured speeds in petabits. One petabit equals 1 million gigabits.</p>
<p>The record transmission demonstrated a data transmission capacity of 22.9 petabits per second in a single fiber-optic cable. The previous record for data transmission was 10.66 petabits per second, set by the same team at NCIT.</p>
<p>Major progress has been made in recent years in internet data transmission speeds. In October 2022, an international group of researchers <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2022/10/new-data-transmission-record">announced</a> they had broken the world record. That team reported they had reached a test rate of 1.8 petabits per second using a single optical cable.</p>
<p>Results of the Japanese experiment were officially presented in a paper released at the 49th <a class="wsw__a" href="https://ecoc2023.theiet.org/">European Conference on Optical Communications</a> in October. The team said it was able to beat the previous record by a large amount using new methods to expand and combine different WDM and SDM elements.</p>
<p>The method used a fiber-optic cable that contained 38 cores. The researchers said expanding the number of cores resulted in an "increased number of optical paths" for high-speed data transmission.</p>
<p>One researcher was Chigo Okonkwo of Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nltimes.nl/2023/12/25/eindhoven-researchers-break-record-fastest-data-transfer-speed-ever#:~:text=Scientists%20based%20in%20Eindhoven%20have,That%20was%20achieved%20in%202020.">told</a> the country's <em>NL Times</em> the rate of 22.9 petabits per second represented "about 20 times the global internet traffic per second." Okonkwo also noted the speed is about 229 times the total capacity of the kinds of fiber-optic cables currently in use today.</p>
<p>Worldwide, the estimated average internet data transmission speed in 2023 was about 46.8 megabits per second, international research service <em>Statista</em> <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/31075/global-average-internet-download-speed/#:~:text=As%20detailed%20in%20the%20Cable,major%20differences%20between%20world%20regions.">reports</a>. The rate reached 118.7 megabits per second in Western Europe, while Northern Africa had the lowest estimated rate at 9.8, <em>Statista </em>said.<em> </em></p>
<p>The American-based Pew Research Center studies internet data transmission rates across the United States. Pew <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2022/07/how-do-americans-connect-to-the-internet">reports</a> the fastest current data transmission method available in the U.S. – called Fiber to Home – is about 10 gigabits per second. This amount is equal to about 10,000 megabits per second.</p>
<p>Most Americans receive much slower data transmission rates, an average of just under 50 megabits per second. Pew estimates Fiber to Home service only accounts for about 20 percent of the U.S. internet service market.</p>
<p>The NCIT team described its latest test results as "a major step toward the realization of future ultra-large capacity optical communication networks." But in order to reach this goal, the team said its current methods must be further perfected.</p>
<p>For example, the researchers pointed to one major issue that could delay future deployments of its super-fast fiber-optic system. This will be the need to complete "significant <strong>upgrades</strong>" to current telecommunication hardware systems in order<strong> </strong>to support the new cable technologies.</p>

<p>It is a small dog with a big "smile." And it is ready to compete with 200 other kinds of dogs, known as breeds.</p>
<p>Say hello to the Lancashire Heeler.</p>
<p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) announced Wednesday that the rare dog breed can now compete in thousands of dog shows across the United States. That includes the famous Westminster Kennel Club show.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Lex, a Lancashire Heeler, sits at attention on Dec. 29, 2023, in Morristown, N.J.

<p>The AKC <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/lancashire-heeler/">describes</a> the breed as "a medium to high energy dog." The organization says the dogs are intelligent, friendly and quick to learn new tasks. They are happy, talkative and always ready for a walk.</p>
<p>Lancashire Heelers have long bodies and short coats of hair, or fur, in black and tan. The breed stands about 30 centimeters high and weighs up to 7.7 kilograms. Historically, they helped to drive farm animals and chase away rats. The breed can also perform several dog-related sports and activities.</p>
<p>"They're <strong>gritty</strong> little dogs, and they're very intelligent little dogs," says Patricia Blankenship of Flora, Mississippi, who has bred them for many years. "It's an enjoyable little breed to be around."</p>
<p>The breed is often described as "<strong>courageous</strong>, happy, <strong>affectionate</strong> to owner." And owners say they sometimes pull back their lips into a "smile."</p>
<p>Lancashire Heeler Club President Sheryl Bradbury says the breed "has to have a job" or stay active with its owners. It is also helpful for them to meet different people and dogs.</p>
<p>Lancashire Heelers have lived in Britain for hundreds of years, but they are now at risk of dying out as a breed. Britain's Kennel Club has added an average of just 121 Lancashire heelers yearly to its registry in recent years. The AKC says only about 5,000 exist worldwide.</p>
<p>Founded in 1884, the AKC is the United States' oldest <strong>purebred</strong> dog registry. It also organizes dog shows where 201 recognized breeds compete for the traditional "best in show." To get recognized, a breed must have an official breeding <strong>standard</strong> and there must be at least 300 of the animals in at least 20 states.</p>

<p>The desert in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan is filled with hundreds of thousands of people. Some live in tents. Others live out in the open after they were forced to leave neighboring Pakistan.</p>
<p>More than 40 years of war, violence and poverty have turned 6 million Afghans into refugees. Another 3.5 million people are displaced within the country of 40 million. Many were driven from their homes by war, earthquakes and <strong>drought</strong>.</p>
<p>Afghanistan's economy collapsed after the Taliban returned to power following the withdrawal of the United States and NATO allies in 2021. Now, two-thirds of its population depends on international aid to survive.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An internally displaced woman takes care of her sick child in a camp on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023.

<p>Displaced Afghans live in camps around the country. They do not have enough food or firewood for heat in the winter. Women and children often turn to <strong>begging</strong>. Others marry off their young daughters to families willing to pay them money.</p>
<p>In May, for example, 15-year-old Shamila was married at a camp for internally displaced people outside Kabul. She stood in a bright-red dress among the women of the family who congratulated her. But the girl was unhappy.</p>
<p>"I have no choice. If I don't accept, my family will be hurt," said Shamila, whose father did not give the family's name because he feared the Taliban. The <strong>groom's</strong> family is giving her father money to pay off debts taken to support his wife and children.</p>
<p>"I wanted to study and work, I should have gone to school," Shamila said. "I have to forget all my dreams...so at least I can help my father and my family a little and maybe I can take the <strong>burden off their shoulders</strong>."</p>
<p>Last year, Pakistan decided to <strong>deport</strong> Afghans who entered the country illegally. Many Afghans lived for years in Pakistan. They were afraid of continuing conflicts at home. When Pakistan's order was announced, hundreds of thousands feared arrest and fled back to Afghanistan. The Afghans said Pakistani officials often prevented them from taking anything with them.</p>
<p>Their first stop has been the camp in Torkham, where they might spend days or weeks before Taliban officials send them to another place. With little food and little to protect them from the mountain cold, many in the camp are sick.</p>
<p>In a camp at the foot of a mountain, 55-year-old Farooq Sadiq sat with his wife and children on the ground among some of their belongings. Sadiq said he had been living in the Pakistani city of Peshawar for 30 years and owned a home there. Now they had nothing, not even a tent. He said they had been sleeping on the ground for the past eight nights.</p>
<p>"I have nothing in Afghanistan, no house, no place to live, not enough money to buy a house," he said. He hopes to settle somewhere in Afghanistan and get a visa to Pakistan so he can go sell his home there to use the money for his family.</p>
<p>The deportations from Pakistan have greatly increased the large numbers of Afghans who try to migrate into Iran, hoping to find work.</p>
<p>Every month, thousands cross into Iran at the border near Zaranj. At night, with the help of <strong>smugglers</strong>, they climb over the border wall and jump to the other side.</p>
<p>Mostly young men, from age 12 to their 20s, flee Afghanistan this way. They plan to work in Iran and send money home to their families. Many are caught by Iranian border guards and sent back.</p>
<p>Others take a longer trip by car through mountains and deserts on Afghanistan's southwestern border through Pakistan to reach Iran. There is no border wall there. But fighters from the Sunni militant group Jundallah often attack the migrants, killing or kidnapping Shiites among them.</p>
<p>Over several months, <em>Associated Press </em>photographer Ebrahim Noroozi traveled across Afghanistan from its eastern border with Pakistan to its western border with Iran to report their stories.</p>

            <title>Woman, Cat Help Others through Therapy  (2024/1/3)</title>

<p>Every day Juanita Mengel, a 67-year-old woman from the state of Ohio, wakes up and puts on her manufactured leg. The device is called a prosthetic.</p>
<p>Then, Mengel does the same for Lola-Pearl, her colorful five-year-old cat. Lola-Pearl is missing her back left leg.</p>
<p>Mengel has many cats. Most of them have disabilities. But Lola-Pearl is special. She is a <strong>therapy</strong> cat. And, she and Mengel are partners of a kind. They are among 200 therapy cat teams registered in the United States by the nonprofit group, Pet Partners.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image taken from video shows kitten Lola-Pearl looking up at attendees during a Amputees Coming Together Informing Others' Needs meeting on Monday, Dec. 11, 2023, in Troy, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Orsagos)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fc1086e2-7ae0-414d-a684-626c301584f8_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image taken from video shows kitten Lola-Pearl looking up at attendees during a Amputees Coming Together Informing Others' Needs meeting on Monday, Dec. 11, 2023, in Troy, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Orsagos)</span></div>
<p>The group helps humans and pets alike by setting them up into teams to provide animal-assisted intervention. The teams visit hospitals, nursing homes and schools and assist those in need.</p>
<p>Taylor Chastain Griffin is national director of animal-assisted interventions at Pet Partners. She said, "A therapy animal is an animal who's been <strong>assessed</strong> based on their ability to meet new people and not just <strong>tolerate</strong> the interaction, but actively enjoy it."</p>
<p>Chastain Griffin is a researcher who studies the effects of therapy cats. She said there needs to be more research done in cat therapy. She said that there is a lot of research on other therapy animals like dogs, and many people are surprised to learn that cats can be therapy animals too.</p>
<p>"They go into a setting and people are like, 'Whoa, there's a cat on a <strong>leash</strong>. What's happening? It kind of <strong>inspires</strong> people to connect in a way we haven't traditionally heard talked about in other therapy animal interventions," Chastain Griffin said.</p>
<p>Besides dogs and cats, Pet Partners registers seven other species as therapy animals, including horses, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, birds, mini pigs, and llamas and alpacas.</p>
<p>Mengel said Lola-Pearl showed signs that she would make a good therapy cat soon after the animal joined her family. Mengel took her new cat to a meeting for <strong>amputees</strong>.</p>
<p>"She was so good with people I just knew she would be a good therapy cat. People really were attracted to her, too," Mengel said.</p>
<p>Recently people who attended a support group for amputees were able to meet Lola-Pearl. They petted her as she woke up from a rest. On the side of the cat carrier she rode in was a sign: "Therapy Cat" it read.</p>
<p>Mengel was a traveling nurse when she was in a car accident that almost killed her. One of her legs could not be saved.</p>
<p>Later, she connected with a friend in the state of Missouri who had a severely injured kitten. Her legs were <strong>twisted</strong> together. An animal medical specialist worked to repair the damage but, in the end, they had to remove one of the baby cat's legs.</p>
<p>That kitten was Lola-Pearl.</p>
<p>Mengel took Lola-Pearl as her cat after talking with her friend. Despite the difficulties Mengel has faced, she is thankful for Lola-Pearl and their work together.</p>
<p>"It's a really rewarding experience," she said, "I get just as much out of it as the people that I visit."</p>

            <title>Early Childhood Education Programs at Risk  (2024/1/3)</title>

<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) says "The period from birth to eight years old is one of <strong>remarkable</strong> brain development for children." The organization adds that it represents an important time for their development and education.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health says that supporting children's early learning can lead to higher test scores and a better chance of staying in school and going to college. Studies even suggest early learning can lead to fewer <strong>teen</strong> pregnancies, improved mental health, and a longer life.</p>
<p><strong>Early learning in OECD countries</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Elijah Rollings, 2, plays with a train set at Bumble Art Studio daycare center in Astoria, Ore., Friday, Sept. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-ac7c-08dc0b0435db_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Elijah Rollings, 2, plays with a train set at Bumble Art Studio daycare center in Astoria, Ore., Friday, Sept. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer)</span></div>
<p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is made up of 38 democracies with market-based economies. The organization aims to build better policies for better lives.</p>
<p>In a recent education <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/0a156279-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/0a156279-en#:~:text=The%20highest%20enrolment%20rates%20of,primary%20education%20across%20OECD%20countries.">study</a>, the OECD found that most of its member countries provide care or education for children under 5. In countries, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Spain and Britain, at least 95 percent of 3-year-olds are <strong>enrolled</strong> in an early education program.</p>
<p>However, within OECD countries, there can be a large difference in enrollment. In the United States, for example, 80 percent of 3 to 5-year-olds in the capital city of Washington, D.C. are enrolled in early education programs. That is compared to 46 percent in the western state of North Dakota.</p>
<p>The differences also exist in European countries like Greece, Lithuania, and Switzerland. Places with higher rates of women in the workforce usually have higher rates of enrollment for children under 3.</p>
<p><strong>Child care and kindergarten</strong></p>
<p>During the pandemic, the U.S. government provided an additional $24 billion to help child care programs nationwide. The funding finally ended last October.</p>
<p>The Century Foundation is a research organization in New York City. It <a class="wsw__a" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/">estimates</a> that one-third of the programs could close as a result. That affects more than 2.2 million children. The organization says that child care is important for the economy at large since child care permits parents to stay at work.</p>
<p>Around the world, governments invest little in early childhood education, UNESCO says. About 6.6 percent of education budgets are put toward early education programs, 2 percent in poor countries. That is well below the target of 10 percent by 2030 suggested by the children's organization UNICEF.</p>
<p>In the U.S., parents can choose to put their children at age 5 in <strong>kindergarten</strong> or a child care program.</p>
<p>Kindergarten enrollment has dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerned about the virus or wanting to avoid online school, hundreds of thousands of families delayed the start of school for their young children.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press</em> found that kindergarten enrollment remained down 5.2 percent in the 2022-2023 school year compared with the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
<p>Deborah Stipek is a former head of the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University. She said kindergarten is where children learn to follow directions, learn good <strong>behavior</strong>, and get used to learning. Stipek said missing that year of school can put kids at a <strong>disadvantage</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, Aylah went to a children's program that met mainly outdoors instead of enrolling in kindergarten in the state of California. Aylah now has to <strong>adjust</strong> to being inside a classroom and learning the right way to hold a pencil.</p>
<p>"It's harder. Way, way harder," Aylah said of the new way she learned to hold a pencil.</p>
<p>Still, her mother Hannah Levy says it was the right decision to skip kindergarten. She wanted Aylah to enjoy being a child. There is plenty of time, she reasoned, for her daughter to develop study skills.</p>

            <title>Growth Slows, but World’s Population Moves Past 8 Billion to Start 2024  (2024/1/3)</title>

<p>A U.S. government agency says the world's population grew by about 75 million people in 2023.</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau notes the worldwide growth rate in the past year was just under 1 percent. The agency also said there will be 4.3 births and two deaths around the world every second in 2024.</p>
<p>The United States' growth rate is about half that of the world overall. On January 1, 2024, the U.S. had a population of 335.8 million, the Census Bureau said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A busy platform is seen at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on World Population Day in Mumbai, India, Tuesday, July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Rajanish Kakade)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-8e81-08dc0bccffdb_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A busy platform is seen at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on World Population Day in Mumbai, India, Tuesday, July 11, 2023.

<p>The numbers look large. But growth rates around the world have been slowing. The United Nations notes the world population will reach 9 billion in about 15 years. That is three years longer than it took to move from 7 billion to 8 billion. The world population reached 8 billion people in November 2022.</p>
<p>If the current rate continues, the 2020s are likely to be the slowest growing decade in American history, the Census Bureau said.</p>
<p>William Frey is a population expert at the Brookings Institution, a research group based in Washington, D.C. He said the growth rate in the U.S. from 2020 to 2030 will be under 4 percent. The slowest-growing decade recorded in the U.S. took place in the 1930s, after the long economic <strong>depression</strong>. The growth rate for that decade was 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Frey said the predicted growth rate could "<strong>tick up</strong>" in the next few years. But he said it is not likely to be higher than 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Immigration is the reason why the U.S. will not suffer a population loss in 2024. There should be one birth every nine seconds and one death every 9.5 seconds. But there will likely be two new American immigrants every minute in 2024. As a result, every 24.2 seconds, the U.S. population will increase by one person.</p>
<p>The two most populous countries are India and China. India moved ahead of China at some point in 2023. The two countries both have more than 1.4 billion people. By 2050, China's population is expected to decrease by 2.7 percent.</p>

<p>The American space agency NASA's human-like robot Valkyrie looks powerful. It stands 188 centimeters tall and weighs 136 kilograms.</p>
<p>Valkyrie is named after supernatural females in Norse <strong>mythology</strong>. The robot is being tested at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>The robot is designed to operate in "...damaged human-engineered environments," like areas hit by natural disasters, NASA said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="NASA's humanoid robot Valkyrie opens a bag at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., November 16, 2023.

(REUTERS/Evan Garcia)</span></div>
<p>But robots like Valkyrie could also work in space one day.</p>
<p>Robots that look like humans, or humanoid robots, have a <strong>torso</strong>, head, two arms and two legs. Engineers believe that humanoid robots will be able to work similarly to humans and use the same tools and equipment. They just need the right software.</p>
<p>NASA Dexterous Robotics team leader Shaun Azimi said humanoid robots in space could do dangerous jobs. Such jobs include cleaning <strong>solar panels </strong>or dealing with equipment outside the spacecraft. As a result, human astronauts could pay more attention to exploration and discovery.</p>
<p>"We're not trying to replace human crews, we're really just trying to take the<strong> dull</strong>, dirty and dangerous work off their plates to allow them to <strong>focus </strong>on those higher-level activities," Azimi said.</p>
<p>NASA is partnering with robotics companies like Apptronik, which is based in Austin, Texas. The goal is to learn how humanoid robots developed for purposes on Earth could help the development of future humanoid robots meant for space.</p>
<p>Apptronik is developing Apollo, a humanoid robot whose jobs on Earth will include working in warehouses and manufacturing plants. The robot can move packages and organize objects. Apptronik plans to start providing the humanoid robots to companies in early 2025.</p>
<p>Apptronik Chief Technology Officer Nick Paine said Apollo has strengths in comparison to humans.</p>
<p>"We're targeting having this system online 22 hours a day," Paine said. "This does have a <strong>swappable</strong> <strong>battery</strong>, so you can work for four hours, swap the battery and then keep going."</p>
<p>Apptronik chief Jeff Cardenas said there are many possibilities as new software and development increase Apollo's abilities.</p>
<p>"The approach is we're starting in the warehouse and on the manufacturing floor, but then it can move into retail...to <strong>delivery </strong>and out more into what we call unstructured spaces," Cardenas said.</p>
<p>In years to come, those "unstructured" areas could include space, Azimi said. He said the robots are being designed so they can be easily changed to do many different jobs.</p>
<p>"Robots like Apollo are designed with <strong>modularity </strong>in mind to be able to adapt to many <strong>applications</strong>," Azimi said.</p>
<p>Azimi added that NASA is aiming to find out what areas it needs to look into "to bring a<strong> terrestrial </strong>system into the space environment..."</p>

            <title>New Treatments for Sickle Cell Remain Out of Reach for Many  (2024/1/2)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>United States health officials recently approved two new gene treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD). The treatments provide hope that the disease might be curable. But experts say high costs and limited availability will prevent many people from receiving them.</p>
<p>SCD is a genetic disorder that causes oxygen-carrying red blood cells in the body to become misshapen. The condition can block blood flow and cause severe pain and organ damage.</p>
<p>SCD is more common among Black Americans, Africans and Middle Easterners than other population groups. Many children with the most severe form of the disease die before age five, usually from an infection or severe blood loss.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Gautam Dongre, of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations, sits for a portrait with his daughter, Sumedha, 13, at their residence in Nagpur, India, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023.

<p>Worldwide, the disease is believed to affect millions. It is known to be common in places with high cases of malaria, like Africa and India. Scientific research has shown that people who have SCD seem to react less severely when they are infected with malaria.</p>
<p>While an estimated 1 million people suffer with the condition in India, many of them will not get the chance to receive the new gene treatments. The situation is not new to developing countries. Many have long faced limitations on medicines and other treatment methods for disease.</p>
<p>But the problem is even more severe with the new SCD treatments and other gene-based methods. This is mainly because of the high cost of treatment. The two methods approved in the U.S. – both of which are given as a single treatment – cost between $2.2 million and $3.1 million.</p>
<p>In addition, the treatment itself can be difficult to carry out in developing nations. This is because the process generally involves several steps and requires longer stays in well-equipped hospitals.</p>
<p>Vertex's treatment, called Casgevy, is designed to repair the genetic condition that causes misshapen cells in sickle cell sufferers. It uses a <strong>gene editing</strong> technology called CRISPR to do so. The other treatment, offered by a company called Bluebird Bio, does not use CRISPR technology. But it requires a similar treatment process as Vertex's version.</p>
<p>Dr. David Altshuler is the chief scientific officer at Vertex. He told <em>The Associated Press</em> that while there is clearly a "great unmet need" for the new SCD treatments, the process also presents "<strong>challenges</strong>."</p>
<p>Altshuler said Vertex is working to simplify the treatment process to make it be available to more people. For example, his team is seeking to develop a medication in pill form that could perform similarly to the gene editing method.</p>
<p>But experts have warned that simpler treatments will likely still be too costly for many people. This has led to calls for governments and non-profit organizations to get involved to help provide financial assistance to patients.</p>
<p>Gautam Dongre lives in the city of Nagpur in central India. His two children suffer from SCD. He told the AP he has been "praying the treatment should come to us."</p>
<p>Dongre's son is now 19 years old and his daughter is 13. They both currently take a drug called hydroxyurea. That drug has long been used to help prevent the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells in an effort to control pain and other damaging effects.</p>
<p>Dongre leads India's National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations. He said many patients in rural parts of India are dying at very young ages without getting effective treatment.</p>
<p>He added that if the gene treatments for SCD one day make it to India, he would like his children to be among the first to get them.</p>
<p>But Dongre noted that people in all countries – rich or poor – should be able to get the latest treatments available. "We are all part of one single planet," he said.</p>

<p>Saodat Sadikova is an English teacher in Jizzakh, Uzbekistan. As a young girl, she dreamed of becoming a flight attendant and traveling the world. Her parents told her she would have to learn at least three languages in order to reach that goal.</p>
<p>Although she was not able to become a flight attendant, Sadikova did study languages. She speaks Uzbek, Russian, English and Turkish.</p>
<p>Sadikova has never traveled outside Uzbekistan. Even so, she reports feeling connected to people around the world. "The whole world is for human beings," Sadikova said. She still dreams of visiting many countries.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's Digital Map of the World Project.

<p>American Trina Bright worked in education for nearly 25 years. Today, she lives in the southern U.S. state of Arkansas. During her career, she traveled to many countries, including China and South Africa.</p>
<p>Bright used stories from her travels to help her students in the U.S. understand their place in the world. She spent most of her career in a minority-serving school district. Sharing stories from her travels helped her students see value in their own cultures. "There's value in all experiences, not just <strong>typical</strong> American ones," Bright said.</p>
<p>Bright has visited more than 20 countries. But Bright, unlike Sadikova, does not report feeling connected to people around the world.</p>
<p>Bright is not alone. She is among the more than half of Americans who report they do not feel especially close to people around the world.</p>
<p>That information comes from a new report by Pew Research Center, an organization that aims to inform the public about the issues, beliefs and trends shaping the world. The report, called <em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/12/06/attitudes-on-an-interconnected-world/" target="_blank">Attitudes on an Interconnected World</a></em>, was released on December 6.</p>
<p>Pew recently asked people in 24 countries a series of questions about how connected they feel to their own communities and countries as well as to people around the world. Pew researchers looked at, among other things, how international travel experience relates to feelings of connectedness.</p>
<p>About half of all <strong>respondents</strong> reported they feel at least <strong>somewhat</strong> close to people all over the world.</p>
<p>Feeling close to others around the world is more common in Europe than in most other places, the study found. In the United States, only 35 percent of the respondents said they feel at least somewhat connected to those in other countries. The percentage was even lower in Argentina (28 percent) and Indonesia (22 percent).</p>
<p>The study found that, in general, respondents who had traveled to at least one other country feel more connected to people around the world.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of respondents in the Netherlands reported having visited at least one other country and about half said they had visited 10 or more countries. The Pew researchers found that 77 percent of respondents from the Netherlands said they feel at least somewhat close to people all over the world.</p>
<p>But international travel does not always mean a person feels a closeness to people around the world. Bright, the retired American schoolteacher, is one such exception. She said, "I don't know a bunch of people around the world, just some." And, she said, her connections to them are not especially deep.</p>
<p>Pew researchers found a similar case in Sweden. Ninety-nine percent of Swedish respondents said they had visited at least one other country. Yet a much smaller share of Swedish respondents – 47 percent – report feeling close to people all over the world.</p>
<p>In fact, a higher number of Indian respondents – 68 percent – report feeling at least somewhat close to people all over the world. Yet just 3 percent of respondents from India said they had traveled to another country. Such findings show that international connectedness can be formed in ways other than traveling overseas.</p>
<p>Sadikova, the Uzbek English teacher, told VOA Learning English she feels connected to people all over the world even though she has never traveled outside Uzbekistan. She said, "Some years ago it was difficult for us to get information about people in the world, but currently, because of media, it is quite easy to get <strong>acquainted with</strong> events and news."</p>

<p>As 2023 comes to a close, we are taking a look back at some of the biggest space stories of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Asteroid sample returns to Earth</strong></p>
<p>A container carrying asteroid material captured in space three years ago <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-s-first-asteroid-samples-arrive-on-earth/7283121.html">arrived safely</a> on Earth in September. The container, or capsule, was released by the American space agency NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft. It floated to Earth and landed in a desert area in the western state of Utah.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The first full-color image released by NASA from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, in a composite made from images at different wavelengths taken with a Near-Infrared Camera and released July 11, 2022. (NASA)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/09680000-0a00-0242-06b8-08da64e835e7_cx0_cy17_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The first full-color image released by NASA from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, in a composite made from images at different wavelengths taken with a Near-Infrared Camera and released July 11, 2022. (NASA)</span></div>
<p>The spacecraft captured the asteroid material, or sample, from the <strong>asteroid</strong> Bennu in 2020. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-bennu-asteroid-sample-contains-carbon-water/">announced</a> in October the first examinations of the sample showed evidence of high-carbon material and water. These two substances suggest the possibility that "the building blocks of life on Earth may be found in the rock."</p>
<p><strong>Psyche mission</strong></p>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft launched on a <strong>mission</strong> to observe an asteroid made mostly of metal. It is expected to travel 3.6 billion kilometers over six years to reach the asteroid, also called Psyche.</p>
<p>NASA believes the asteroid could have separated during violent crashes that happened during our solar system's early creation. Scientists think data collected on the asteroid could provide new details about how rocky planets, including Earth, formed.</p>
<p><strong>Laser communication demonstration</strong></p>
<p>The Psyche spacecraft is also being used <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-laser-communication-test-gets-data-from-16-million-kilometers-away/7366203.html">to test a laser-based communication method</a>. The system aims to greatly improve data links between Earth and spacecraft exploring deep space.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/cat-steals-the-show-in-video-sent-by-laser-from-space/7405809.html">demonstrated the technology</a> with a short video sent by the laser technology over 30 million kilometers to Earth. The space agency said it took less than two minutes for the video to reach an observatory in California. The video showed a cat repeatedly chasing a red laser light.</p>
<p><strong>Oldest black hole discovery</strong></p>
<p>Scientists <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-scientists-discover-oldest-black-hole-yet-/7345766.html">announced</a> last month they had discovered the oldest black hole ever found. The huge object is believed to have formed about 470 million years after the Big Bang. The researchers said the findings confirm their theory that supermassive black holes existed in the very early universe.</p>
<p><strong>European telescope shows ‘dark universe'</strong></p>
<p>Last month, the European Space Agency (ESA) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/new-space-telescope-aims-to-show-dark-universe-/7347238.html">released</a> the first images from its new Euclid space telescope. ESA designed Euclid to study dark matter and dark energy. Scientists think those hidden forms of matter and energy make up 95 percent of the universe. ESA said the newly-released images covered 1,000 galaxies about 240 million light years away from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Webb telescope observes distant black hole </strong></p>
<p>Data collected by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/webb-telescope-observes-most-distant-black-hole/7179285.html">helped astronomers identify</a> the most distant, active supermassive black hole ever discovered. Researchers said the black hole sits at the center of a galaxy called CEERS 1019. The galaxy is estimated to have existed about 570 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p><strong>Ingenuity helicopter keeps exploring Mars</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, NASA said its Ingenuity helicopter continues to perform well in tests carried out on Mars. So far, Ingenuity has completed at least 66 flights over the past two-and-a-half years. NASA said it is also <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-continues-mars-helicopter-experiments-tests-new-design-on-earth/7379281.html">testing equipment on Earth</a> that it plans to include in future helicopters built for space exploration. The latest tests on Earth involved new <strong>rotor blades</strong> the space agency said reached speeds near the speed of sound in experiments.</p>
<p><strong>India lands spacecraft on moon</strong></p>
<p>In August, India became the fourth country to successfully <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/india-successfully-lands-spacecraft-on-moon/7238173.html">land a spacecraft on the moon</a>. The moon lander, called Chandrayaan-3, also became the first spacecraft to land near the moon's south pole. The south pole is thought to be an important area, with scientists saying it may contain large amounts of frozen water and minerals.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese water discovery on moon</strong></p>
<p>Chinese scientists <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/china-research-mission-finds-new-source-of-water-on-moon/7025621.html">announced in March</a> they had discovered water in materials collected during the country's Chang'e 5 mission. Researchers from Nanjing University reported the water was in the form of extremely small <strong>beads</strong> found in dirt collected in 2020. The scientists noted that billions, if not trillions, of these beads could exist on the moon, possibly providing a huge water source. But the team said mining the water would be difficult.</p>

<span class="datetime">31 December 2023</span><br/>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Language experts estimate as many as 10,000 people still speak the French-based language Louisiana Creole.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, many others in New Orleans and across the southern U.S. state consider themselves part of the culture that draws tens of thousands of people to events. The celebrations include autumn's Festival Acadiens et Creoles, summer's Creole Tomato Festival, and spring's Tremé Creole Gumbo &amp; Congo Square Rhythms Festival.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But for locals and visitors alike, everyday evidence shows how strong Creole culture is in Louisiana. The state's performance spaces and airwaves are often filled with the driving, <strong>rhythmic</strong> sound of zydeco and other Creole and Cajun music. Louisiana's restaurants offer <strong>dishes</strong> with rich, complex flavors including gumbo, hot sausage, red beans and rice, and shrimp étouffée.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Cheyenne and 7th Ward Creole Hunters Mardi Gras Indians are pictured at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans, May 4, 2017. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-5f19-08dbe24a75ff_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Cheyenne and 7th Ward Creole Hunters Mardi Gras Indians are pictured at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans, May 4, 2017.

<p>"To celebrate Creole culture is to wake up and live in New Orleans," said Christina Bragg. She is a member of the Mahogany Blue Babydolls, a parade group for Black and mixed-race women.</p>
<p>"Celebrating Creole is celebrating our day-to-day lives. The food we eat. The music we dance to. The way we gather with friends to parade during <strong>Mardi Gras</strong>," she said. "Every day I open my eyes and breathe, it's a celebration of Creole culture, because that's who I am."</p>
<p><strong>Difficult to define</strong></p>
<p>So, what is Creole?</p>
<p>"It's food, it's music, it's architecture, it's <strong>style</strong> and it's traditions," Mona Lisa Saloy told VOA. "There are millions of Creole people in countries across the world...we are all so much more alike than we are different. We create beautiful cultures everywhere we go, and I think that's evident here in Louisiana."</p>
<p>Saloy is the writer of the poetry collection <em>Black Creole Chronicles</em> and served as Louisiana's poet laureate from 2021 to 2023. She said Creole cultures all over the world have similarities to Louisiana's.</p>
<p>"<strong>Architectural</strong> styles common in New Orleans like the Creole Cottage or the Shotgun home can be found in other places with Creoles, such as in other parts of the American South and the Caribbean," she said. "Much of our music <strong>derives</strong> from the rhythms of Africa and the Caribbean, as does much of our food — elements of gumbo such as the long rice and okra, for example, or the <strong>prevalence</strong> of beans."</p>
<p>How the word "Creole" is defined changes from place to place and person to person.</p>
<p>The word "Creole" is believed to have come from the Portuguese word crioulo, which developed from the Latin word for "to create." Some say it was used in the European slave trade to describe a slave born in the New World and not in Africa. The word took on different meanings in different places. Creole in much of Africa and part of the Caribbean, for example, came to mean people of mixed ethnic or racial backgrounds.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, the definition has changed over the years.</p>
<p>"Here, the definition kind of depends on who you ask," said Vance Vaucresson. He is a New Orleans-based Creole and owner of a local restaurant, the Vaucresson Sausage Company.</p>
<p>"I prefer an inclusive definition," he said. "By that definition, anyone born in Louisiana could be Creole. During our colonial <strong>era</strong>, it was meant to differentiate people born in the Americas — usually of French, Spanish or African descent — from those born in Europe or Africa."</p>
<p>Describing his definition, Vaucresson added: "...it doesn't matter. If you're born here and embrace the culture, you can be Creole."</p>
<p>In Louisiana of the 1700s and 1800s, the more inclusive definition was possibly the most accepted. White people with European ancestry were just as likely to call themselves Creole as mixed-race people of African ancestry.</p>
<p>White Creoles claimed the term because it set them apart from settlers who were coming from Northern states after The Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. Mixed-race Creoles, too, claimed the term because it differentiated them from enslaved people.</p>
<p>Don Vappie is a Creole jazz musician in New Orleans. He described the idea of Creole before the Civil war as organized into three levels. "It was more of a three-<strong>tier</strong> racial <strong>hierarchy</strong> here, instead of the two-tiered Black-or-white experienced elsewhere in the U.S," he said.</p>
<p>After the American Civil War, however, many of these differences in New Orleans disappeared.</p>
<p>"Creole or not, white people had more in common with white people and Black people had more in common with Black people," Vappie told VOA.</p>
<p>Saloy believes Creole is firmly connected to African culture and should stay that way.</p>
<p>"The <strong>ingredients</strong> in our food, the rhythm in our music and dance, the details in our architecture — it's all connected to West African culture," she said, "That's our heritage."</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">31 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Beneath each full moon, a group of women in religious clothing surround a fire near a village in central Mexico.</p>
<p>They breathe in deeply from a<strong> joint</strong> and blow clouds of <strong>marijuana </strong>smoke out toward the fire.</p>
<p>Despite their religious clothing, the women are not religious. They are part of an international group founded in 2014 called Sisters of the Valley. The group has promised to spread its ideas about the healing powers of the drug marijuana.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Members of Sisters of the Valley, a non-religious international group check hemp that is drying at a house on the Sisters of the Valley's farm on the outskirts of a village in central Mexico, September 2, 2023. (REUTERS/Raquel Cunha ) " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/45a52a89-6715-48c7-93b7-6e679fa46c60_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Members of Sisters of the Valley, a non-religious international group check hemp that is drying at a house on the Sisters of the Valley's farm on the outskirts of a village in central Mexico, September 2, 2023. (REUTERS/Raquel Cunha ) </span></div>
<p>The group also launched a successful small business in the United States, where about twenty states have legalized recreational marijuana use. It sells products made from <strong>cannabis</strong>, the plant from which marijuana comes.</p>
<p>The Sisters of the Valley business made over $500,000 last year.</p>
<p>But in Mexico, a drug war has hurt the country, and Christianity is built into society. The group says its image of marijuana-smoking nuns is like an act of rebellion, the women say.</p>
<p>The sisters often post on social media, mainly Instagram. The pictures show them caring for cannabis crops, leading workshops, and attending cannabis-related events.</p>
<p>Their business makes around $10,000 each year, small compared to their partners in the U.S.</p>
<p>The five women are careful to hide possible personal and workplace identifiers in the images they post. They do business out of a building with a false storefront.</p>
<p>Cannabis production is a legal gray area in Mexico. Much of the activity remains tied to criminal organizations, called cartels. The women say they worry that both police and crime groups could threaten them.</p>
<p>On a recent weekend, reporters from Reuters news agency visited.</p>
<p>One of the nuns, who uses the name "Sister Bernardet" online, said "The Sisterhood is in a totally different <strong>context</strong> here in Mexico – because of how religious the country is and because of the plant's ties to cartels."</p>
<p>She asked Reuters to not report her real name as she feared attack or punishment if her identity is discovered. In her main job as a <strong>homeopathic </strong>caregiver, she prescribes marijuana to her patients with cancer, joint pain and sleep problems.</p>
<p>"We want to take the plant back from the" drug dealers, she said.</p>
<p>The Sisters have borrowed some ideas from the Beguines, a religious movement that existed for a few hundred years starting in the 1100s. The group, made up of single women, devoted itself to spirituality, scholarship and providing aid to the needy. It was not officially connected to any religion.</p>
<p>The Sisters worldwide say they wear religious clothing called habits to demonstrate uniformity and show respect for the plant.</p>
<p>With the help of Alehli Paz, a chemist and marijuana researcher working with the group, the Sisters in Mexico grow a small crop.</p>
<p>They grow the plants in old paint containers and place them in lines between four walls on a rooftop.</p>
<p>Later, the Sisters move the larger plants to private gardens.</p>
<p>Their work is limited to weekends, when they care for the plants and produce cannabis goods.</p>
<p>The women visit other groups in the expanding cannabis community in Mexico City pushing for full legalization. The women also give workshops that touch on everything from how to make products like cannabis infusions to the chemistry behind the plant.</p>
<p>Business possibilities aside, the women argue that the fight against drugs in Latin America has been a failure, leading to violence and mass imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Sisters of the Valley founder in Mexico calls herself "Sister Camilla" online. She would not give her real name to Reuters. She said she grew up in a religious family. She left home at 16 partly because of her mother's strong religious ideas, she said. When she started Sisters of the Valley Mexico, their relationship became even more difficult.</p>
<p>"It was hard for her to accept," she said about her mother. "She had certain ideas, heavily shaped by religion."</p>
<p>But today, after long talks about the plant and the legalization movement, her mother helps with the group's operations, she said.</p>

            <title>Arizona Company Works to Recycle Old Solar Panels  (2023/12/31) | 美国企业致力于回收太阳能旧面板</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202312/arizona-company-works-to-recycle-old-solar-panels.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The first generation of solar panels in use on homes and other buildings will soon be too old to work anymore. Owners will need to replace them.<br/>
用于家庭和其他建筑的第一代太阳能电池板很快就会太旧，无法再使用。业主们需要更换它们。</p>
<p>But, what can be done with the old equipment, aside from adding it to waste landfills?<br/>
但是，除了将旧设备送到垃圾填埋场之外，还能对其做些什么呢？</p>
<p>Adam Saghei in the U.S. state of Arizona hopes he has the answer.<br/>
美国亚利桑那州的亚当·赛葛希望他能解决。</p>
<p>He is the leader of a business called We Recycle Solar.<br/>
他是一家名为“We Recycle Solar”的公司的负责人。</p>
<p>He said most solar panels last about 30 years. So many of the first panels put to use in America are reaching the end of their usefulness. Most will go to landfills, he said.<br/>
他说，大多数太阳能电池板的使用寿命约为30年。许多最早在美国投入使用的面板已经到了实用性的极限。他说，大部分将被送往垃圾填埋场。</p>
<p>However, his company, and a few others, are working to collect old panels and make them useful again.<br/>
然而，他的公司和其他一些公司正在努力收集旧面板，并使其再次可利用。</p>
<p>He said the process is part of what he called "the circular economy."<br/>
他说，这个过程是他所说的“循环经济”的一部分。</p>
<p>"(Solar) is a sustainable form of energy; there needs to be a plan for the retirement of those assets," he said.<br/>
他说：“（太阳能）是一种可持续的能源形式；需要有一个退役这些资产的计划。”</p>
<p>For example, Saghei said many of the panels that fail only have a small problem. Often it can be easily fixed. Then, the repaired piece can be offered in new markets, often in other countries.<br/>
赛葛说，例如，许多失效的面板只有一点小问题。通常情况下，它可以很容易地修复。然后，修复后的零件可以提供给新市场，通常是在国外。</p>
<p>Saghei said the company's engineers learned how to recover valuable material from the old solar panels. They can remove silver, copper, glass, and silicone from the broken panels. All the materials have market value.<br/>
赛葛说，该公司的工程师学会了如何从旧太阳能电池板中回收有价值的材料。它们可以分离破损面板上的银、铜、玻璃和硅树脂。所有这些材料都有市场价值。</p>
<p>It took the engineers three years to perfect the materials recovery process, which Saghei called "urban mining."<br/>
工程师们花了三年时间完善了材料回收过程，赛葛称之为“城市采矿”。</p>
<p>The company can process up to 7,500 solar panels every day at its center in Yuma. Saghei said they can recover up to 99 percent of the useful material from each panel.<br/>
该公司位于尤马的工厂每天可以处理多达7500块太阳能电池板。赛葛说，他们可以从每块面板中回收高达99%的有用材料。</p>
<p>Meng Tao is a professor at Arizona State University and an expert on sustainable energy systems.<br/>
孟涛是亚利桑那州立大学教授，也是可持续能源系统专家。</p>
<p>He said solar panel installations will reach their highest numbers in about 20 years. At that point, he said, the number of new panels being produced will equal the number of old panels going out of service. The cost to recycle the old panels, however, may be too high.<br/>
他说，太阳能电池板的安装数量将达到20年来的最高水平。他说，到那时，正在生产的新面板数量将等于停用的旧面板数量。然而，回收旧面板的成本可能太高。</p>
<p>At that point, he said, it will be very easy for homeowners to decide to send their panels to a landfill. But the U.S. government, he said, should provide money for solar panel recycling projects as part of its environmental policies.<br/>
他说，到那时，房主很容易决定把他们的电池板送到垃圾填埋场。但他说，美国政府应该为太阳能电池板回收项目提供资金，作为其环境政策的一部分。</p>
<p>That way, making a better choice will be easier for homeowners.<br/>
这样，对房主来说，也更容易做出更好的选择。</p>
<p>Saghei said he hopes his company is getting into the business at the right time. Recovering the materials from old panels is costly work. He said it takes a lot of labor, time and energy.<br/>
赛葛说，他希望他的公司是在正确的时间进入这项业务。从旧面板中回收材料是一项成本高昂的工作。他说这需要大量的劳动力、时间和精力。</p>
<p>But he thinks taking out the valuable materials and sending them back into the supply chain is a winning idea.<br/>
但他认为，取出有价值的材料并将其送回供应链是一个成功的想法。</p>
<p>"These are markets that are growing," Saghei said. "What's exciting is we're at the forefront."<br/>
赛葛说：“这是增长中的市场，令人兴奋的是，我们站在了最前沿。”</p>

            <title>Affirmative Action Decision Tops Higher Education News in 2023  (2023/12/31)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">30 December 2023</span><br/>
<p><em>As 2023 comes to a close, we take a look back at the top stories and developments in higher education. They include a major high court decision on college admissions, the return of international students at U.S. colleges, the closure of small colleges and study programs, and an Ivy League president stepping down under pressure. </em></p>
<p><strong>Affirmative Action decision</strong></p>
<p>In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities could no longer consider the race of a student when making admissions decisions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Demonstrators protest outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, DC on June 29, 2023, after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, saying race cannot be a factor. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-4f95-08db7e332d43_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Demonstrators protest outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, DC on June 29, 2023, after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, saying race cannot be a factor. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)</span></div>
<p>The announcement effectively ended the idea of <strong>Affirmative Action</strong>, which had been in place in higher education and the workforce for over 50 years.</p>
<p>In making its decision, the court looked at cases involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: "students must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual – not on the basis of race."</p>
<p>He noted that many who make choices about which students will be permitted to attend universities have given too much importance to the color of a person's skin. "Our constitutional history does not <strong>tolerate</strong> that choice," he continued.</p>
<p>A group called Students for Fair Admissions brought the case through the U.S. court system over a number of years. The group believed that many Asian and white students were not getting a fair chance to attend the most selective colleges and universities in the U.S. because some places were being held for Black students.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden spoke in favor of racially <strong>diverse</strong> colleges and universities after the decision came out.</p>
<p>Many universities said they will change the writing requirements of their applications in order to learn of the life experiences of applicants. The first group of students affected by the new rules will be applying to college in early 2024.</p>
<p>The next step for activists who want to change the way colleges choose students? <strong>Legacy</strong> admissions. A group based in Boston took legal action against Harvard University, saying it should no longer give preference to students whose parents attended Harvard or give money to the school.</p>
<p><strong>Indian students boost numbers</strong></p>
<p>More and more young people from India are now attending college in the United States. As a result, the number of international students studying in the U.S. has returned to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>While students from China are still the largest group, the number of Chinese international students in the U.S. is dropping. But the 269,000 Indian students made up that difference.</p>
<p>Costas Chassapis works at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. Chassapis told VOA Learning English that many university leaders in the U.S. are "<strong>ecstatic</strong>" about the increase in Indian students. But he said the increase will not last forever.</p>
<p>The increase is partly due to new rules put in place by Joe Biden's administration. They permit students who complete study programs in STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – to stay in the U.S. for extra work experience.</p>
<p><strong>American students question college</strong></p>
<p>As international students return to the United States, many American young people are expressing concern about the value of a college degree.</p>
<p>The number of American college-age students seeking higher education started falling before the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's young people find that they have work possibilities that pay well even without a college degree. Some say the cost of attending college is simply too high.</p>
<p>West Virginia is the only state in America with a population that is lower today than it was in 1950. The state's public university, West Virginia University (WVU), feels the effects of the population loss. Today, its main campus has about 25,000 students. That number is 10 percent lower than it was in 2015. WVU is facing a $45 million budget deficit.</p>
<p>Last summer, WVU announced plans to cut some study programs. The school will end some language studies, music instruction and writing programs. In addition, 100 educators will likely lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Lisa Di Bartolomeo is one of the language professors concerned about her students. She said: "The best and the brightest students don't see a future for themselves in West Virginia."</p>
<p>But at least WVU remains open. Some small colleges and universities closed or made plans to close in 2023.</p>
<p>One of those schools was Alliance University in New York City. Heather Garcia studied and worked there. She said the university tried to remain open, but its financial problems were too large. She said she is sad to see the school close.</p>
<p>Bryan Alexander is a researcher who looks at the future of higher education. He said small American colleges first try to reduce their costs. When they can no longer cut their costs, they must close. He said many people in higher education are concerned about the number of small schools that have closed in recent years.</p>
<p>"I think, within higher ed, the <strong>alarm</strong> has already been sounded," Alexander said. "Presidents, Deans, <strong>Provosts</strong>...this is the stuff that keeps them up at night."</p>
<p><strong>Ivy League president leaves job under pressure</strong></p>
<p>Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania stepped down from her job in early December.</p>
<p>Magill, along with Harvard President Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology appeared in front of Congress on December 5. Lawmakers asked the presidents if they felt calls for violence against Jewish people should be against school rules.</p>
<p>The Republican-led congressional committee chose the three leaders because their schools "have been at the center of the rise in <strong>antisemitic</strong> protests," a committee spokesperson said in a statement. The protests are related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>None of the three school leaders directly spoke against calls for violence against Jewish people. Instead, they said some speech, even "deeply hateful speech," is protected by the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>On December 9, Magill resigned from her position under pressure from influential donors and <strong>alumni</strong>.</p>
<p>Gay and Kornbluth received support and criticism. But both were permitted to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>One group of professors at Harvard said colleges and universities should not be influenced by political pressure.</p>
<p>A top legal expert from Harvard, Laurence Tribe, said universities should not be "<strong>bullied</strong> into <strong>micromanaging</strong> their policies."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>December 31, 2023, means the new year 2024 is nearly here! At this time of the year, many people set New Year's <strong>resolutions</strong>. Many people want to make a change in life and others set a <u>goal.</u></p>
<p>So, today we talk about the word <u>goal</u>. You may know this word because you shout "gooaaal" when your team <strong>scores</strong>. It is exciting! It is also exciting when we reach our personal goals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Chelsea's Levi Colwill, top center, scores a goal during a soccer match between Chelsea and Brighton and Hove Albion, at Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Dec. 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-8988-08dbf42a856a_cx3_cy0_cw90_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Chelsea's Levi Colwill, top center, scores a goal during a soccer match between Chelsea and Brighton and Hove Albion, at Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Dec. 3, 2023.

<p>A goal is something we want to reach. It is something we work toward. It is important to have goals in life and a plan to <strong>achieve</strong> them. A football player's goal is to score a goal, and a goalie's goal is to stop a ... goal.</p>
<p>Let's continue talking about sports. Many sports involve not only goals but also a <u>goal line</u>. A <u>goal line</u> gives the space on the field in which you can score or make a goal.</p>
<p>Let's talk about American football for a minute. That sport involves tall <u>goal posts.</u> To make a point, a kicker can kick a football between the posts and score. Now, imagine if you are kicking that ball. You have the <u>goal posts</u> in your sights. You kick! It looks good! It looks like the ball is going to go between the posts. But then, at the last minute, someone moves the <u>goal posts,</u> and your ball does not go through.</p>
<p>To <u>move the goal posts</u> as you are kicking the ball would not be fair. If someone <u>moves the goal posts</u>, they are changing the rules of the game or a situation to meet their own needs.</p>
<p>Let's say you are building a house for someone. Both of you agree on a design, plan and price to build the house, and a date to complete the building. As the date of completion arrives, the soon-to-be owner wants to change the design of the house. She says that she wants the new design for the same price.</p>
<p>You could say that she has <u>moved the goal post</u>! Or you could say that she has <u>moved the goal line</u> because some sports use a line and not a post. And some sports use both.</p>
<p>People who have the <u>goal line</u> or <u>goal post</u> moved on them may <u>fall short of their goals</u>. If you fall short of your goal you do not <strong>accomplish</strong> it. You do not succeed.</p>
<p>To reach your goals, it is a good idea to have a plan. Set out small steps you can do to reach your goals. And when you complete those small steps on your way to your end goal ... make sure to celebrate! And make sure no one moves the goal line on you.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next year ...</p>
<p>I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Barack Obama.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Barack Obama" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c610d8ab-a9b4-42fe-a6fb-942ebb9ce341_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Barack Obama</span></div>
<p>He first took office in 2009 and was re-elected in 2012. Because his presidency is so recent, this program will not try to offer a historical<strong> perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>But one part of his legacy is already clear. Obama is the United States' first African-American president. His father was a black man from Kenya; his mother was a white American from the Midwestern state of Kansas.</p>
<p>For many Americans, Obama's presidency was an important symbol in a country that permitted black people to be enslaved.</p>
<p>And, even after the U.S. Constitution officially banned slavery in 1865, African-Americans have been <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/28/blacks-have-made-gains-in-u-s-political-leadership-but-gaps-remain/">extremely under-represented</a> in the U.S. government.</p>
<p>By 2009, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm" target="_blank">only five </a>African-Americans had <em>ever</em> served in the U.S. Senate – and Obama was one of them.</p>
<p>Even many people who did not vote for Obama said his election to the country's highest office made them proud or hopeful. A <a class="wsw__a" href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-11-06-poll_n.htm">public opinion survey</a> immediately after Election Day found that two-thirds of Americans believed that the country's racial conflicts could be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Obama's parents met as students at the University of Hawaii. His father had won a scholarship to study economics. His mother went on to earn a degree in math there, as well as a graduate degree.</p>
<p>The two married and had a son, whom they named after his father: Barack Hussein Obama, Jr.</p>
<p>But the couple soon separated. The older Barack Obama returned to Kenya, where he later died in a car accident.</p>
<p>Barack's mother went on to marry another man. He was from Indonesia. The family moved to Jakarta, and the couple had a daughter named Maya.</p>
<p>When Barack was 10, his mother sent him back to Hawaii to live with her parents. She wanted him to get a good education. Barack finished high school in Hawaii, then went on to Occidental College in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York. There, he completed a degree in political science.</p>
<p>But Obama said the best education he received was in one of his first jobs. He worked as a community organizer in Chicago. He helped people who lived in public housing put pressure on the city government to improve their conditions.</p>
<p>Obama later said the work showed him how important it was to understand the legal process. So he entered Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>Over the next years, Obama worked as a lawyer, wrote a <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/books/review/06obama-dreams.html">book</a> about his experience as a person of mixed race, and married <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/michelle-obama/" target="_blank">Michelle Robinson</a>, a woman he worked with at a law<strong> firm</strong>.</p>
<p>She and Barack Obama settled in Chicago and had two daughters, Malia and Sasha.</p>
<p>When he was in his mid-30s, Obama began his political career. He was elected three times to the Illinois state senate. After 10 years there, he won a seat in the U.S. Senate in a landslide victory.</p>
<p>That same year, Obama attended the Democratic National Convention – the meeting where the party officially nominates a presidential candidate. Obama was not one of the candidates. But the Democrats asked him to make an important speech.</p>
<p>In it, Obama famously <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=76988" target="_blank">talked about</a> how his life story was an American story. He said he was confident the U.S. could overcome its divisions and achieve unity.</p>
<p>"There's not a<strong> liberal </strong>America and a<strong> conservative</strong> America," he said. "...There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's a United States of America."</p>
<p>Only four years later, Obama would be elected its 44th president.</p>

<span class="datetime">29 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>2024 is just hours away. Before the world welcomes a new year, we remember some of the influential people who died in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Day O'Connor</strong></p>
<p>We start with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - President Joe Biden attends a funeral service for retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at the Washington National Cathedral, December 19, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fbb20de5-880f-4b08-b66d-74a56da7636d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">FILE - President Joe Biden attends a funeral service for retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at the Washington National Cathedral, December 19, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</span></div>
<p>O'Connor died on December 1. She made history in 1981 when she became the first woman appointed to the United States' highest court. She served in the position for 25 years.</p>
<p>The judge was considered a centrist, or a moderate, in her court opinions. She was often considered the "<strong>swing vote</strong>" on major issues such as abortion, affirmative action and voting rights.</p>
<p>Sandra Day O'Connor was born in El Paso, Texas in 1930. She grew up on a large cow farm there.</p>
<p>The young Sandra was an excellent student and entered Stanford University in California when she was 16, earning a degree in economics. She went on to study law at Stanford. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her class in 1952.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan nominated her to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981. In announcing his choice, he described the judge as "a person for all seasons."</p>
<p>American President Joe Biden spoke at her funeral. He called her "a daughter of the West" and "a pioneer in her own right." He praised her for seeking, in his words, "equal justice under law her whole life."</p>
<p>O'Connor died from problems linked to the disease dementia and a lung infection. She was 93 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Kissinger </strong></p>
<p>The world also said goodbye to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who died November 29.</p>
<p>He was 100 years old.</p>
<p>The German-born Jewish refugee served as the U.S. top diplomat under two presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He won praise and severe criticism in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>Kissinger helped restore ties between the United States and China. He also negotiated the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalynn Carter</strong></p>
<p>American former first lady Rosalynn Carter died on November 19. She was the closest adviser to her husband, former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>She served as first lady from 1977 to 1981. She <strong>advocated </strong>for better mental health care and help for caregivers in millions of American families. Overseas, she fought disease, mass hunger and the abuse of women and girls. She continued humanitarian work with her husband for 40 years following their time in the White House.</p>
<p>The couple had been married for 77 years when Rosalynn Carter died at the age of 96.</p>
<p>Others from the world of politics who died this year include: former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, former Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf, and former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.</p>
<p><strong>Tina Turner</strong></p>
<p>The world also lost cultural leaders in 2023, including the so-called "Queen of Rock ‘n' Roll."</p>
<p>American Singer Tina Turner died in May at the age of 83.</p>
<p>The entertainer teamed up with husband Ike Turner for a series of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and '70s. Ike was abusive and beat Tina. She left the marriage and returned as a solo artist with a best-selling album, <em>Private Dancer,</em> in 1984.</p>
<p>"How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and <strong>trauma</strong> and used it as a means to help change the world?" actor Angela Bassett said in a statement. Bassett played Turner in the 1993 movie <em>What's Love Got to Do With It</em>.</p>
<p>Turner sold more than 150 million records worldwide and won 12 Grammys. The performer was voted along with Ike Turner into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and individually in 2021. Turner's life story was made into a movie and Broadway musical.</p>
<p>Mick Jagger of the music group The Rolling Stones called Turner "<strong>inspiring</strong>, warm, funny and <strong>generous</strong>" in an Instagram post. And he wrote that Turner "helped me so much when I was young, and I will never forget her."</p>
<p><strong>Kenzaburo Oe </strong></p>
<p>Several Nobel Prize winners died this year, including Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe. The Nobel literature laureate wrote darkly poetic novels based on his childhood memories from Japan's postwar occupation. He also wrote from his experiences as the parent of a disabled son. Oe died on March 3 at the age of 88.<br type="_moz"/>
</p>
<p><strong>World's oldest person</strong></p>
<p>And the world lost its oldest resident in 2023. French religious worker, or nun, Lucile Rando, died at home in southern France a few weeks before her 119th birthday.</p>
<p>Sister André, as she was known, was born in the town of Alès, southern France, in 1904. The Gerontology Research Group, which confirms details about people thought to be 110 or older, listed her as the oldest known person in the world after the death of Japan's Kane Tanaka, aged 119, in 2022.</p>
<p>Sister André was also one of the world's oldest survivors of COVID-19.</p>
<p>She tested positive for the coronavirus in January 2021, shortly before her 117th birthday. She showed so few signs of the virus that she did not even realize she was infected. News media around the world reported her survival.</p>
<p>In April last year, she was asked about her exceptional <strong>longevity</strong> through two world wars. Sister André told French media, "Working...makes you live. I worked until I was 108."</p>
<p>She was also known to enjoy a daily glass of wine and chocolate.</p>

            <title>The World in Other Words in 2023  (2023/12/30)</title>

<p>Many people consider choices from dictionary publishers, including <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/ai-hallucinate-authentic-or-rizz-for-word-of-the-year/7385065.html">artificial intelligence, authentic or rizz</a>, to be "words of the year." But the Associated Press reported on some words used in other parts of the world that have been gaining popularity.</p>
<p>So today, we will look at other words from around the world for 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Password child in Australia</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Brazilian tourists hold hands standing in a circle in the Pueblo Encanto park in Capilla del Monte, Argentina, July 19, 2023. Known as the nones, they describe themselves as atheists or nothing in particular.

<p>In Australia, the local Macquarie Dictionary has been selecting a "word of the month" all year. One was "cozzie livs," a word that Australians use to <strong>complain</strong> about the high cost of living. Another was "murder noodle" for a snake in a country that is home to the world's most poisonous snake.</p>
<p>But "password child" is a word that many parents can recognize. Australians use the term to describe children seen as favored over their brothers or sisters because their name is used in their parents' passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Kitawaramba in Kenya (Swahili) </strong></p>
<p>Paul Mackenzie, a cleric in the East African nation of Kenya, said the word "kitawaramba" on his way to court. He was accused of asking his followers to starve themselves in order to meet Jesus. More than 400 people died as a result.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar word appeared to be a threat. Now Kenyans use it to warn others that something bad might happen to them for their actions.</p>
<p><strong>Bwa kale in Haiti (Creole)</strong></p>
<p>Criminal groups have brought violence, including killings and kidnappings, to the daily lives of people in Haiti, an island nation in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>Civilians have been fighting back and saying "bwa kale" as they chase suspected criminals. "Bwa Kale" means "<strong>peeled</strong> wood" in the Haitian Creole language.</p>
<p>The term had long been used to express male <strong>dominance</strong> and power. Now it has spread overseas. A video on social media shows a group of Latino soccer fans saying "Bwa kale!" after their team beat an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>税 (zei) in Japan (Japanese)</strong></p>
<p>The top Buddhist leader at the Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto wrote the word 税 (zei) in a closely watched yearly event.</p>
<p>The Japanese public chose "zei," which means taxes, to best represent the year 2023. Many expect taxes to increase to pay for the country's military buildup. Under the latest national security plan, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government aims to double Japan's yearly defense spending to about $69 billion. That would make the country the world's third largest military spender after the U.S. and China.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 9pt;">The nones around the world</strong></p>
<p>In many countries, there has been a big increase in the number of people who select the word "none" when asked about their religion.</p>
<p>The nonbelievers, atheists, or agnostics have become known as the "nones."</p>
<p>The "nones" are believed to make up of 30 percent or more of the adult population in the United States and Canada, as well as several European countries. Japan, Israel and Uruguay are among other nations where large numbers of people are "nones."</p>
<p>And that's the world in "other" words for 2023.</p>

<span class="datetime">29 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the words "change" and "vary."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Change and Vary" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4c54-08dc07f9f5ba_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Change and Vary</span></div>
<p>I'm Ali, and I live in Mashhad, Iran.</p>
<p>What is the difference between "change" and "vary?"</p>
<p>I'm keen on knowing how American people use "vary" in different forms in daily conversations.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Ali</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing to us, Ali!</p>
<p>Here is the first major difference between the word "change" and the word "vary": Only one of them is a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>"Change" is that word. You can "change your opinion" for example. That's change as a verb.</p>
<p>You can also have "<em>a</em> change of opinion." That's change as a noun!</p>
<p>"Vary" is more narrow in meaning. It means to make a partial change in something, or to diversify something.</p>
<p>Sometimes change and vary are <strong>synonyms</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's look at each one more closely.</p>
<p><strong>Change as a verb</strong></p>
<p>While "change" can be either a noun or a verb, we will compare the verbal meanings and uses to "vary."</p>
<p>It can be used in a lot of different situations and can be a synonym for many other verbs like transform, exchange, switch or alter.</p>
<p>"Change" meanings range from making a difference or altering something particular to completely transforming or replacing something.</p>
<p><em>Many schools are changing the college application requirements in response to the ending of</em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-colleges-ask-for-more-writing-after-affirmative-action-ban/7209025.html"><em> Affirmative Action.</em></a></p>
<p><em>Water changes from a liquid to a solid when it freezes at zero degrees Celsius</em>.</p>
<p>"Change" can also mean making a slight modification in something to switching or making a shift from one thing to another.</p>
<p><em>The leaves change colors every autumn. </em></p>
<p><em>Emma changed her shirt because she spilled something on it.</em></p>
<p><em>Derek changed his money from dollars to euros when he went to France. </em></p>
<p>Andrey's <strong>accent</strong> changed after he moved to the big city.</p>
<p><strong>Vary </strong></p>
<p>Now let's look at "vary."</p>
<p>"Vary" is a verb. It can mean to make a partial change or to differentiate between items by size, amount or degree.</p>
<p><em>I like to vary my meals with different types of grains and greens.</em></p>
<p><em>Insects vary in size from large to very small.</em></p>
<p>It can also mean to show or experience a change.</p>
<p><em>The night sky varies depending on the Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun.</em></p>
<p><em>Interest rates vary due to how the economy is.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Ali.</p>

<span class="datetime">28 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>This year, social media services gained a lot of attention for their growth methods and for their influence.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press</em> recently looked back at 2023 to see what developments in social media were most important and what might be ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter becomes X</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An X sign rests atop the company headquarters in downtown San Francisco, on July 28, 2023. Elon Musk's social media company, formerly known as Twitter, has filed a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters.

<p>In October of 2022, businessman Elon Musk <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/twitter-introduces-new-x-logo-to-replace-blue-bird/7194172.html">took over</a> Twitter. He promised to make big changes at the social media service. Musk is known for leading the electric vehicle company Tesla and SpaceX, a space transport company. He bought Twitter for $44 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Musk dismissed about 75 percent of the company's workforce soon after the deal was completed. He said the dismissals were necessary to make Twitter more effective and to increase profits. He also announced plans to have Twitter users pay eight dollars a month to keep their verified accounts. Verified accounts are identified as belonging to people with a lot of followers.</p>
<p>As chief, Musk also lifted some existing restrictions on users, including many well-known people who had been barred by earlier Twitter leadership. Former U.S. President Donald Trump was among the Twitter users whose accounts were <strong>reinstated</strong>.</p>
<p>Musk said those changes were part of a larger effort to protect the free speech of Twitter users. But critics said his plans were likely to increase the amount of harmful content and hate speech on the service.</p>
<p>This year, the AP noted that some LGBTQ groups have raised concerns that X is less safe. Some activist groups said they have left the service.</p>
<p>Many Twitter users chose to leave the service earlier this year because of Musk's changes. Some advertisers stopped doing business with the company. In October, X said it had over 500 million users and is adding users all the time. The company also said it has improved in combating misleading or false information by using Community Notes. X says it uses over 100,000 people to help confirm information.</p>
<p>Musk has said he hopes to change X into an "everything app" like China's WeChat. But it remains unclear if U.S. and Western users like the idea of using one app for nearly all their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Social media competition</strong></p>
<p>Many users criticized the changes Musk was putting in place at X. Other services aimed to provide competition.</p>
<p>Mastodon is a service from a German software developer that lets users share information across several apps. Bluesky is a service that came out of Twitter and has connections to former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey. Bluesky operates by invitation only.</p>
<p>Some users who did not like the changes to Twitter went to those services.</p>
<p>In July, the parent company of Facebook, Meta, launched another <strong>rival</strong> to X called Threads. Millions of people joined after the announcement. In December, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company was testing "interoperability." That is an idea that lets people use their accounts on different services, or platforms. Zuckerberg said the company was performing a "test where posts from Threads accounts will be available on Mastodon and other services that use the Activity Pub protocol."</p>
<p><strong>Is social media good for children's mental health?</strong></p>
<p>Social media's influence on children's mental health gained a lot of attention this year. The U.S. surgeon general warned in May that there is not enough evidence to show that children and teenagers are safe using the services. Dr. Vivek Murthy called for technology companies and parents to take "immediate action to protect their kids now."</p>
<p>Murthy noted how social media is pushing big changes in the way children think of themselves, form friendships and experience the world.</p>
<p>In October, about 33 states brought legal action against Meta for harming young people's health. The legal action said the company regularly collects information on children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>And in December, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed major changes to laws controlling the way companies can follow and advertise to children. The agency proposed turning off targeted advertisements to children under 13 and limiting <strong>notifications</strong> to them.</p>
<p><strong>And in 2024...</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence powers chatbots that perform writing tasks and create material for users of services like ChatGPT. In the fall, Meta chief Zuckerberg said his company was "building the future of human connection." He said that people will soon communicate with <strong>hologram</strong> versions of their friends, coworkers and others. The company demonstrated AI bots using the images of famous people such as Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. Meta believes many social media users will want to interact with <strong>celebrities</strong>.</p>
<p>Enberg, the social media expert, said AI will be used throughout social media platforms. "Social apps will use AI to drive usage, ad performance and <strong>revenues</strong>, <strong>subscription</strong> sign ups," and business activity, she said. Experts say social media services learned from Musk's X that subscriptions are a good way to make money.</p>
<p>Important elections will take place in the United States, India and other places in 2024. Some experts are worried about AI's abilities to create materials that can contain misinformation and then spread on social media.</p>
<p>A.J. Nash is an official with ZeroFox, an internet security company based in the state of Maryland. Nash said materials spread this way will have a "major" influence on elections.</p>
<p>"We're not prepared for this," he said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Alessandra Zarelli works to keep the artwork of the Vatican Museums in good condition. She says, whenever she works on a masterpiece, she must calm her heart so her thinking can center on her work.</p>
<p>Vatican City is a small country surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. It is the headquarters and seat of government of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican Museums contain thousands of artworks hundreds of years old including paintings by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>"The emotion of working on something like a Michelangelo is truly indescribable," said Zarelli. She helped repair one of his wall paintings in Vatican City's Pauline Chapel.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Restorers Alessandra Zarelli and Rossana Giardina work on paintings at the painting and wood materials restoration laboratory inside the Vatican Museums, at the Vatican, December 11, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c5bc0212-d6f6-4539-aaf5-b609902737ed_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Restorers Alessandra Zarelli and Rossana Giardina work on paintings at the "painting and wood materials restoration laboratory" inside the Vatican Museums, at the Vatican, December 11, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane)</span></div>
<p>Michelangelo painted during the Renaissance period of European history during a growth of interest in science, art, and literature.</p>
<p>Zarelli is part of a special team at the Vatican Museums' repair laboratory for paintings and wood pieces.</p>
<p>The team is responsible for looking after thousands of square meters of wall paintings, including the famous ceiling and walls of the Sistine Chapel. They also look after some 5,300 oil paintings and wooden statues.</p>
<p><strong>A century of restoration</strong></p>
<p>The painting and wood lab is one of eight specialized groups in the museums. It permitted several news organizations, including Reuters, the chance to see its inner workings to mark its 100th anniversary.</p>
<p>Care and repair methods change often and today's workers often have to repair mistakes from care workers that came before them. They repair work from recent history to many centuries ago.</p>
<p>Another problem, usually from the distant past, is that restorers were not technicians but artists in their own right. Francesca Persegati is chief restorer at the Vatican Museums. She said that some of those artists thought they could "improve" the original by adding their own work.</p>
<p>"It's important to be <strong>humble</strong> in this job, to respect the work but also to have a scientific background to understand the materials," she said.</p>
<p>Before a painting even reaches the lab, another team carries out tests to see if paint or color has been added since the piece was first made. They also check it for possible other work below the surface.</p>
<p>In another part of the lab, Caterina Manisco was working on an 1895 painting called <em>Madonna and Child Between St. Teresa and St. Francis</em>. Italian Emma Richards was the artist. She painted for the rich and powerful, like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Such work was a rarity for women artists of the time.</p>
<p>"Because she was a woman, I somehow feel very close to her," said Manisco, an external restorer at the lab.</p>
<p>To mark the 100th anniversary of the paintings and wood lab, the Vatican Museums are using special technology. It permits visitors to use their phones to connect with information about the artwork they are looking at.</p>

            <title>US Data Shows More Women Live in East, More Men in West  (2023/12/29) | 美国数据显示女性多居东部男性多居西部</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202312/us-data-shows-more-women-live-in-east-more-men-in-west.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Official population data show more men live in the western United States, while more women live in the East and South.<br/>
官方人口数据显示，更多男性生活在美国西部，而更多女性生活在东部和南部。</p>
<p>The data was collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers appear in the 2022 American Community Survey, released last week. The report gives state and local leaders the latest population and demographic information each year in order to plan investments for their communities.<br/>
这些数据是由美国人口普查局收集的。这些数字出现在上周发布的2022年美国社区调查中。该报告每年向州和地方领导人提供最新的人口数量和人口信息，以便为其社区规划投资。</p>
<p>The report found that women outnumber men in the most populated counties east of the Mississippi River. Women also outnumber men along the U.S. East Coast and in southern states.<br/>
报告发现，在密西西比河以东人口众多的县，女性人数超过男性。美国东海岸和南部各州的女性人数也超过了男性。</p>
<p>The highest population of men was found west of the Mississippi and on the U.S. West Coast.<br/>
密西西比河以西和美国西海岸的男性人口最多。</p>
<p>The American Community Survey found that across the U.S., there were 96.6 adult men for every 100 adult women.<br/>
美国社区调查发现，在美国，成年男性和成年女性的比例是96.6比100。</p>
<p>The report seeks to identify a sex ratio, meaning the number of male and females living in a particular area. The ratio numbers do not consider sexual preference, gender identity or whether people included in the report were looking for partners.<br/>
该报告试图确定一个性别比例，即生活在特定地区的男性和女性人数。该比例数字没有考虑性偏好、性别认同，也没有考虑报告中的人是否在寻找伴侣。</p>
<p>Adult women outnumbered adult men around the eastern cities of Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and Philadelphia.<br/>
东部城市巴尔的摩、纽约、亚特兰大和费城的成年女性人数超过成年男性。</p>
<p>The biggest imbalances of men to women - with ratios above 103 for those age 18 and over - were recorded in the West. The highest ratios were found in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Austin, Texas. Men to women ratios were highest in California, including areas around San Francisco, San Jose and Bakersfield.<br/>
男性与女性之间最大的不平衡发生在西部，其18岁及以上男女比例超过103比100。比例最高的是科罗拉多州的科罗拉多斯普林斯和得克萨斯州的奥斯汀。加利福尼亚州的男女比例最高，包括旧金山、圣何塞和贝克斯菲尔德周围的地区。</p>
<p>Population researchers say the ratios are influenced partly by the presence of certain organizations and industries that appeal more to one sex or the other. San Diego, California, for example, has several large military bases populated with a majority of men. And Austin, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose have a large number of technology companies. Industry groups estimate men make up about three-quarters of the tech workforce.<br/>
人口研究人员表示，这一比例在一定程度上受到某些组织和行业的影响，这些组织和行业对男性或女性更具吸引力。例如，加利福尼亚州的圣地亚哥有几个大型军事基地，那里男性居多。奥斯汀、旧金山、西雅图和圣何塞都有大量的科技公司。行业组织估计，男性约占科技劳动力的四分之三。</p>
<p>At birth, the sex ratio in the U.S. has historically been 105 men for every 100 women. That ratio begins to change around age 30.<br/>
从历史上看，美国出生时的男女性别比例是105比100。这个比例在30岁左右的年龄开始发生变化。</p>
<p>The U.S. death rate is higher for men than it is for women in nearly every age group. Researchers say this is because more men are affected by violence, drinking, smoking, job risks and suicide. But the ratio decreases over time until age 90. Around that age, there are generally two women to every man.<br/>
美国几乎所有年龄段的男性死亡率都高于女性。研究人员表示，这是因为更多的男性受到暴力、饮酒、吸烟、工作风险和自杀的影响。但随着年龄段的推移，这一比例会下降，直到90岁。在90岁左右，通常男女比例为1比2。</p>
<p>Michal Naisteter is a professional matchmaker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A matchmaker is someone who tries to bring two people together for a romantic relationship. She told the Associated Press she sees a difference in where single men and women choose to live. In the Philadelphia area, for example, she says single women are more likely than men to live within the city limits. But single men are more willing to live in areas outside the city, called suburbs.<br/>
Michal Naisteter是宾夕法尼亚州费城的一名职业媒人。媒人是指试图把两个人撮合在一起建立恋爱关系的人。她告诉美联社，她发现单身男女选择生活的地方有所不同。例如，在费城地区，她说单身女性比男性更有可能生活在市区。但单身男性更愿意住在郊区。</p>
<p>Naisteter notes that because of such differences, people looking for a partner need to put in solid, thoughtful efforts to make connections. She suggests that people expand their search areas to include more available singles.<br/>
Naisteter指出，由于这些差异，寻找伴侣的人需要付出坚实、深思熟虑的努力来建立联系。她建议人们扩大搜索范围，以纳入更多可以找到的单身人士。</p>
<p>Such searches "should take work," Naisteter noted. "Because nothing is sweeter than something you have to work for."<br/>
Naisteter指出，这样的搜索“应该会奏效”。“因为没有什么比你必须努力追求伴侣更甜蜜了。”</p>

<span class="byline">By Alice Bryant</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The New Year comes on different dates for different cultures. And most of the Western world celebrates it on January 1st.</p>
<p>One thing many cultures have in common is the idea of New Year's resolutions. A New Year's resolution is a personal goal to change unwanted behavior, make a life improvement, or try something new.</p>
<p>In the United States, popular New Year's resolutions often include losing weight, improving your finances, volunteering for an organization, or spending less time on social media.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Grammar and New Year's Resolutions " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-24a1-08dc065fe300_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Grammar and New Year's Resolutions </span></div>
<p>On today's Everyday Grammar, we will show you how to talk about resolutions in English.</p>
<p><strong>Asking a question</strong></p>
<p>First, let's learn how to <em>ask</em> people about their resolutions.</p>
<p>Listen to a short <strong>conversation</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Hey there, Faith. Happy New Year! Great to see you.</em></p>
<p><em>Hi, Greg. Happy New Year to you too! How was yours?</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It was crazy! We went to New York and watched the ball drop in Times Square. It was really crowded and loud – but still really fun.</em></p>
<p><em>Sweet! <u>Do you have any New Year's resolutions</u>?</em></p>
<p>Faith asked Greg about <strong>resolutions</strong> simply by saying, "Do you have any New Year's resolutions?"</p>
<p>You can also say, "What are your New Year's resolutions?" to ask about more than one or "What is your New Year's resolution?" to ask about one.</p>
<p>Now, let's find out how to answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Using phrasal verbs</strong></p>
<p>When we make statements about our resolutions, we often use <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>.</p>
<p>We can use the phrasal verb "take up" to say that we will start a new activity as a <strong>hobby</strong>.</p>
<p>Listen to Faith and Greg continue their conversation:</p>
<p><em>Sweet! Do you have any New Year's resolutions?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, I do. I plan to <u>take up</u> kickboxing starting next week. I'm excited to finally do it rather than just talk about it! How about you?</em></p>
<p>Another phrasal verb for resolutions is "give up," which is to stop doing or using something. We can use this verb to talk about ending bad <strong>habits</strong> or changing behavior for a time.</p>
<p>Let's hear Faith respond using the verb "give up":</p>
<p><em>How about you?</em></p>
<p><em>I am <u>giving up</u> sugar for the month of January. Then, for the rest of the year, I'm avoiding soft drinks.</em></p>
<p><em>Wow!<strong> </strong>I wish I could join you but the kickboxing class starts soon. I'll probably want some sweets after class!</em></p>
<p>Another phrasal verb, "cut out," has the same basic meaning as "give up." For example, Faith could say, "I am cutting out sugar for the month of January."</p>
<p>But in many situations, we do not need phrasal verbs to talk about resolutions, as you will soon see.</p>
<p><strong>Using future forms</strong></p>
<p>Next, let's talk about verb <strong>tenses</strong> and forms. Greg talked about his new kickboxing activity using the verb "plan" followed by the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/getting-to-know-gerunds-and-infinitives/3111996.html" target="_blank">infinitive</a> verb form and Faith talked about giving up sugar using the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-present-progressive/3255195.html" target="_blank">present continuous</a> verb tense, also called "BE + ing."</p>
<p>We can also use the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-fun-with-future-tenses/2935173.html" target="_blank">simple future</a> tenses: one with "will" and the other with "going to." These tenses are especially useful when the New Year has not come yet.</p>
<p>Imagine it's the last week of the year and a few people are talking to each other about resolutions: Here are some things you might hear:</p>
<p><em>In 2024, I'<u>m going to visit</u> my friends every month.</em></p>
<p><em>By the end of March, I <u>will stop</u> eating sweets.</em></p>
<p><em>In the new year, I'<u>m going to </u>practice kickboxing every week.</em></p>
<p>When we use simple future tenses to talk about resolutions, we're expressing that we are making a promise to or plan for ourselves. The noun "resolution" comes from the verb "resolve," which means to make a serious decision to do something.</p>
<p><strong>Infinitives and gerunds</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed that the statements so far today did not actually use the word "resolution." That is because the subject was already known by the listeners. But it is still perfectly normal to start your statements with, "My New Year's resolution is..." or "My New Year's resolutions are..." An <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-gerunds-infinitives/2722827.html" target="_blank">infinitive verb or a gerund</a> must come after these phrases. Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>My New Year's resolution is <u>to call</u> my sister on video every week.</em></p>
<p>The infinitive verb here is "to call."</p>
<p>You can also use a gerund, like this:</p>
<p><em>My New Year's resolution is <u>calling</u> my sister on video every week.</em></p>
<p>Well, that's all for today's program. Tell us about your New Year's resolutions in the comments below. Or email us at learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

            <title>Top Technology Stories of 2023  (2023/12/28)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The past year <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/a-big-year-for-artificial-intelligence/7403954.html">marked the rise</a> of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools. But here is a look back at some of the other noteworthy technology stories we covered in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Google, Apple face major legal challenges</strong></p>
<p>Both Apple and Google faced lawsuits accusing them of carrying out unfair business methods linked to their <strong>app</strong> stores. The cases might cost the companies billions of dollars and change the way similar app stores do business.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Google logo displayed at the company's European headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2010." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/C9423EC6-B00F-4264-A935-198256C8807E_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Google logo displayed at the company's European headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2010.</span></div>
<p>A decision in the Google case was reached earlier this month when an American jury <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/jury-rules-google-app-store-operates-as-monopoly/7396589.html">found</a> Google's app store operates as an illegal <strong>monopoly</strong>. The case was brought by video game company Epic Games.</p>
<p>One of the main questions in the case was whether Google had the right to require app developers to use Google's app store's payment systems. The jury ruled Google's monopoly covered both its app selling system and payment processing within the app. Google condemned the decision and appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Epic brought a similar lawsuit against iPhone maker Apple that was decided in April. In that case, a judge in California mostly sided with Apple. But the judge did order Apple to permit developers to add their own links to process payments within iPhone apps.</p>
<p><strong>EV battery technology and production</strong></p>
<p>The worldwide demand for electric vehicle (EV) <strong>batteries</strong> continues to grow. But supplies of the materials used to make them are limited. Currently, China controls most mining and processing of a group of 17 metals known as rare earths.</p>
<p>One of the main materials used to produce the batteries is lithium, a light metal substance. Other necessary materials include the metallic elements cobalt, manganese and nickel. Even though some of the minerals are mined in nations outside China, Chinese companies still hold ownership over the operations.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid a dependence on Chinese controlled materials, the United States and other countries are <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/demand-for-electric-car-batteries-drives-nations-to-seek-own-materials/6526662.html">seeking to mine and process more materials at home</a>.</p>
<p>In February, U.S. President Joe Biden announced federal assistance programs to help companies mine and process lithium and other rare metals. Similar efforts were announced in other countries, including Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>In addition, major automakers said they were <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/automakers-seek-to-produce-ev-vehicles-with-fewer-rare-earths/7362904.html">seeking new EV engine designs</a> that are less dependent on rare earth minerals. EV market leader Tesla said it plans to remove rare earths from its next-generation EVs. Other automakers said they are in the process of researching or developing EV motors that use little or no rare earth minerals. These include General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, and BMW.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic developments</strong></p>
<p>We covered several developments involving robotic systems.</p>
<p>A team of American researchers <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/soccer-playing-robot-set-to-compete-in-robo-cup-/7064373.html">announced</a> it had built a human-like robot that can play soccer at a high level. The robot, named ARTEMIS, is one of only a few humanoid robots that can run. It also can walk and jump on different kinds of surfaces without losing its balance. The robot also can kick a ball and remain standing even when kicked or hit, the team said.</p>
<p>In Germany, many companies – large and small – <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/german-companies-turn-to-robots-to-fill-jobs-for-retiring-workers/7332773.html">turned to robots</a> to fill jobs as the country faced a severe labor shortage. The International Federation of Robotics estimated that about 26,000 robotic machines were put into use in Germany last year. Experts say increasing robotic operations are a sign that robots have become easier to use, with no special skills required.</p>
<p>However, the risks of using machines in the workplace <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/industrial-robot-crushes-worker-in-south-korea/7348375.html">were demonstrated</a> in South Korea, where an industrial robot crushed a worker to death at a vegetable processing center. Police said the victim was an employee of a company that deploys industrial robots to businesses.</p>
<p>NASA even <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-tests-snake-like-robot-to-search-for-life-in-the-solar-system/7099496.html">tested</a> a snake-like explorer designed to search for signs of life in hard-to-reach places. The American space agency said the robot is equipped to move in ways that traditional explorer vehicles, called rovers, cannot. In the future, NASA plans to send the robot to space to search for signs of life in an underground ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus.</p>

<p>The Endangered <strong>Species</strong> Act had widespread support when President Richard Nixon signed it into law late in 1973. In the 50 years since, the effects of the legislation have been both successful and complex.</p>
<p>Most Americans celebrated the law that helped save animals such as the bald eagle and bison. But when the law stood in the way of economic progress, many questioned whether it was too strong.</p>
<p>The act took effect around the same time as other laws designed to protect natural resources such as water, air and the wilderness. In the 1960s and 1970s, no other country in the world had put such wide protections into place.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A California condor named Hope takes to flight at the Condor habitat at the Los Angeles Zoo, Tuesday, May 2, 2023.

<p>Concerns came later when the law prevented projects such as a hydroelectric dam in Tennessee from moving forward. The concern? A small river fish no one had ever heard of.</p>
<p>That fish is called the snail darter. Plans to protect the fish held up progress on the Tellico Dam for more than two years. Biologists eventually decided to catch the small fish and move it to other rivers.</p>
<p>The fish population grew over time and the snail darters were removed from the endangered species list in 1984. About one year ago, the fish had fully recovered.</p>
<p>Jim Williams was the first so-called "fish guy" in the Office of Endangered Species. When his group listed the fish, he recalled, the decision made a lot of people upset.</p>
<p>He said his director told him not to list the fish. But Williams said he planned to follow the law and make decisions based on facts, not on possible public reaction.</p>
<p>The snail darter decision showed the U.S. government that the law was going to be difficult to <strong>manage</strong>. Some said the government should not try to save all species. Others said all animals and plants should be safe from extinction. The debate continues today.</p>
<p>Many more disputes over the protection of species came up over the next 45 years. In each case, employees at the Endangered Species Office made decisions that upset some people but ultimately saved the animals.</p>
<p><strong>Gray wolves</strong></p>
<p>In northern Minnesota in the 1980s, the gray wolf population had recovered from only around a few hundred to about 1,000. The Endangered Species Act had helped save the gray wolf.</p>
<p>With the population growing, people wanted permission to hunt the animals. The Fish and Wildlife Service sought to cooperate with the state of Minnesota and open the gray wolf to hunting.</p>
<p>The move required a <strong>regulation</strong> showing that a hunting season would help the wolves and was the only way to control their population.</p>
<p>Ron Nowak was a wolf expert in the Endangered Species Office at the time. The Fish and Wildlife Service told Nowak to write the regulation. "And I said, ‘It would be illegal,'" Nowak said.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service found someone else to write the regulation. <strong>Conservation</strong> groups took legal action and called Nowak as a witness. He traveled to Minnesota to tell the government that wolves should not be open to hunting.</p>
<p><strong>California condor</strong></p>
<p>LaVerne Smith started working in the Endangered Species Office in 1978. Soon after came a major decision involving the California condor, the largest bird native to North America. By 1982, only 23 California condors were left. Biologists were looking at whether the species could be saved.</p>
<p>The office made a plan to move the remaining birds into a safe and closed area and <strong>breed</strong> them.</p>
<p>The plan worked. Today, there are more than 400 California condors. They can even be seen flying over the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Smith said, "the day I saw one sail over the Grand Canyon, I was like, ‘Oh my God! That was all worth it.'"</p>
<p>Later in her career, Smith led the effort to list the polar bear as endangered. It marked the first time an animal was listed as endangered because of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Freshwater mussels</strong></p>
<p>Marc Imlay began working at the Endangered Species Office in 1971, two years before the current Endangered Species Act was passed.</p>
<p>Imlay is an expert on mollusks – small animals including snails, mussels and slugs. He had concerns that hydroelectric dams were putting freshwater mussels in danger in states such as Missouri and Tennessee.</p>
<p>At one point, Imlay decided to make a phone call to a conservation group in Missouri to tell them that a planned dam would put the mussels in danger.</p>
<p>The call worked. He got locals to pay attention to the organism and the dam was stopped. In time, his work prevented a number of dams from being built.</p>
<p>While some could argue that Imlay slowed economic progress, he said in other cases he found a way to help development move forward.</p>
<p>"Time and time again," he said, "you can work with a developer" to save high-quality land.</p>

<p>Bahara Rustam is 13 years old. She took her last class at Bibi Razia School in Kabul, Afghanistan, on December 11 knowing it was the end of her education. Under Afghan law, she is unlikely to ever step foot in a classroom again.</p>
<p>In September 2021, the country's ruling Taliban announced that females would be barred from education after sixth grade, or about age 13. The government said it was acting in line with Islamic religious law.</p>
<p>The United States and NATO troops had withdrawn from Afghanistan a month earlier, after 20 years of war.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Afghan girls attend a religious school, which remained open since the last year's Taliban takeover, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 11, 2022.

<p>In December 2022, the restrictive measure was expanded to include university education.</p>
<p>The international community has continued to condemn the Taliban for the actions. Countries have warned the Taliban that it its actions will bar it from gaining international recognition as a lawful government.</p>
<p>Last week, United Nations special diplomat for Afghanistan Roza Otunbayeva appeared before the UN Security Council. She said she worried that a generation of Afghan girls is falling behind with each day that passes.</p>
<p>An Afghan Education Ministry said last week that girls of all ages are permitted to study in religious schools called madrassas. They have traditionally been boys-only.</p>
<p>The UN is trying to confirm the ministry's statement. But Otunbayeva said it was unclear if that education system included wider study of non-religious subjects.</p>
<p>For now, Bahara is holding onto her education and looks over school books at home. "<strong>Graduating</strong> (from sixth grade) means we are going to seventh grade," she said. "But all of our classmates cried and we were very <strong>disappointed</strong>," she added.</p>
<p>There was no graduation ceremony for the girls at Bibi Razia School.</p>
<p>In another part of Kabul, 13-year old Setayesh Sahibzada wonders what the future holds for her. She is sad she cannot go to school anymore to follow her dreams.</p>
<p>"I can't stand on my own two feet," she said. "I wanted to be a teacher. But now I can't study, I can't go to school."</p>
<p>Researcher Muhammad Saleem Paigir warned that banning women and girls from education would be disastrous for Afghanistan. "We understand that<strong> illiterate</strong> people can never be free and<strong> prosperous</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>The Taliban have banned women from many public spaces and most jobs, all but keeping women inside their homes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>For better or for worse, the number of couples getting married in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, on New Year's Eve could set a record.<br/>
不管是好是坏，内华达州拉斯维加斯市新年前夕结婚的夫妇数量都可能创下纪录。</p>
<p>That is because the date 12/31/23 is known in the Las Vegas wedding industry as a "specialty date." The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the repeating number pattern of 1-2-3 1-2-3 is very popular.<br/>
这是因为2023年12月31日（12/31/23）这天在拉斯维加斯婚礼行业被称为“特色日期”。《拉斯维加斯评论杂志》报道称，1-2-3 1-2-3的重复数型非常受欢迎。</p>
<p>What makes it even more special is that the date falls on a holiday famous for big celebrations.<br/>
更特别的是，这一天恰逢一个以大型庆祝活动闻名的节日。</p>
<p>"It's a double whammy," said Melody Willis-Williams, president of Vegas Weddings, which owns several wedding venues. "Anytime you get these specialty dates, they're always hugely popular. But tie that in with New Year's Eve and it's a showstopper."<br/>
“这是双重冲击，”拉斯维加斯婚礼公司总裁梅洛迪·威利斯-威廉姆斯说，该公司拥有多个婚礼场地。“每当遇到这些特色日期时，它们总是非常受欢迎。但把它与新年前夕联系起来，它就会引人注目。”</p>
<p>Las Vegas is famous for fast marriage ceremonies, and many marriages take place there every year.<br/>
拉斯维加斯以快速举行婚礼而闻名，每年都有许多婚礼在那里举行。</p>
<p>The number to beat on New Year's Eve is 4,492. That is the single-day record for marriages in Las Vegas set on July 7, 2007. The second-most popular specialty wedding date on record with the county's marriage bureau is November 11, 2011, when 3,125 couples married.<br/>
新年前夕要打败的数字是4492。这是拉斯维加斯2007年7月7日创下的单日结婚记录。2011年11月11日是该县婚姻局有记录以来第二受欢迎的特色婚礼日期，当时有3125对新人结婚。</p>
<p>Since 2018, somewhere between 450 and 550 marriage ceremonies take place each year in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, the Review-Journal reported.<br/>
据《拉斯维加斯评论杂志》报道，自2018年以来，拉斯维加斯每年新年前夕都会举行450至550场婚礼。</p>
<p>This year, the company Vegas Weddings is fully booked for midnight at all its venues, including a church in downtown Las Vegas.<br/>
今年，拉斯维加斯婚礼公司的所有场地，包括拉斯维加斯市中心一座教堂在内午夜时段都被预订一空。</p>
<p>Willis-Williams said her company expects to marry more than 120 couples on New Year's Eve. Five of those couples will marry as the clock is counting down to midnight.<br/>
威利斯-威廉姆斯说，她的公司预计在新年前夕将有120多对新人结婚。其中五对将在新年倒计时的时候结婚。</p>
<p>Clark County Clerk Lynn Marie Goya said couples married on a specialty date in Las Vegas have described them as "magic dates" that are easy to remember.<br/>
克拉克县办事员林恩·玛丽·戈雅说，在拉斯维加斯特色日期结婚的夫妇将它们称为非常容易记住的神奇日期。</p>
<p>"I think the celebration that has a group dynamic is really appealing," Goya said. "When everyone is in line and they're all getting married and excited about being in love, it just enhances their own experience."<br/>
戈雅说：“我认为具有团体活力的庆祝活动真的很有吸引力。当每个人排着队，他们都将结婚，并对陷入爱河感到兴奋时，这只会增强他们自己的体验。”</p>

            <title>California Permits Turning Wastewater to Drinking Water  (2023/12/27)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>California officials recently approved new rules to let water agencies <strong>recycle</strong> wastewater and put it right back into the pipes that carry drinking water to homes, schools, and businesses.</p>
<p>It is a big step for California. The state has struggled for many years to secure drinking water for more than 39 million people. It shows a change in public opinion on a subject that as recently as twenty years ago was met with criticism and ended similar projects.</p>
<p>Since then, California has been through several extreme <strong>droughts</strong>. That includes the most recent one that scientists say was the driest three-year period on record. And it left the state's water supply at dangerously low levels.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Lakeisha Bryant, public information representative at the Santa Clara Valley Water District, holds flasks of water before and after it is purified at the Silicon Valley Advance Purification Center on December 13, 2023, in San Jose, California.

<p>"Water is so <strong>precious</strong> in California. It is important that we use it more than once," said Jennifer West. She is director of WateReuse California, a group that supports recycled water.</p>
<p>California has been using recycled wastewater for many years. A team has used it to make ice surfaces for the game of hockey. It has been used to make snow for the sport of skiing. And farmers use it to water their crops.</p>
<p>But it has not been used directly for drinking water. Orange County, a suburban area of Los Angeles, operates a water cleaning system that recycles wastewater and then uses it to refill underground <strong>aquifers</strong>. That water then mixes with the groundwater for months before being pumped up and used for drinking water again.</p>
<p>California's new rules would let – but not require – water agencies to take wastewater, treat it, and then put it right back into the drinking water system. California would be just the second U.S. state to permit this, following Colorado.</p>
<p>It has taken officials more than 10 years to develop these rules, a process that included several studies by independent groups of scientists. A state law required the California Water Resources Control Board to approve these rules by December 31. It was met with just a few days left.</p>
<p>The vote was met with approval by some of the state's biggest water agencies. All of which have plans to build huge water recycling plants in the coming years.</p>
<p>A project in San Diego is aiming to produce nearly half of the city's water through recycling water by 2035. And the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California aims to produce up to nearly 570 million liters a day for its 19 million people. Adel Hagekhalil is with Metropolitan Water. He said the new rules will permit new projects that have not yet been considered.</p>
<p>Water agencies will need public support to complete these projects. That means proving to people that recycled water is not only safe to drink but also not dirty.</p>
<p>California's new rules require the wastewater be treated for all bacteria and viruses, even if they are not present in the wastewater. That is different from regular water treatment rules, which only require treatment for known diseases, said Darrin Polhemus. He is a director of the drinking water group for the California Water Resources Control Board.</p>
<p>In fact, the treatment is so intense it removes all of the minerals that make fresh drinking water taste good. That means the minerals need to be added back at the end of the process.</p>
<p>"It's at the same drinking water quality, and probably better in many <strong>instances</strong>," Polhemus said.</p>
<p>Polhemus added that it takes time and money to build these treatment centers. So, they will only be available for bigger cities at first.</p>

<p>In the third full school year since the COVID-19 pandemic began, students continued to feel the effects of school closures. Some leading experts and education officials worry that the learning loss caused by the pandemic may be long-term.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, many students are missing school. <strong>Chronic</strong> <strong>absenteeism</strong> is becoming more common at school <strong>districts</strong> around the country. Some students went missing from the attendance rolls during the pandemic and have never been accounted for.</p>
<p>And in a year of growing artificial intelligence technology, AI has also entered the classroom. Some schools have banned the use of chatbots like ChatGPT. Other teachers are using the new technology to help students, hoping they use the technology in <strong>appropriate</strong> ways.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Jenes Ochoa Rojas goes over the lines of a three-scene play written by ChatGPT in Donnie Piercey's class at Stonewall Elementary in Lexington, Ky., Monday, Feb. 6, 2023.&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;160; (AP Photo/Timothy D.

Easley)</span></div>
<p>Here is a look at the big issues that shaped education in 2023 and will shape education in the year to come.</p>
<p><strong>Continued learning loss </strong></p>
<p>In June, the U.S. Department of Education released the scores from a national math and reading test that is given to 13-year-olds. About 8,700 students took the test in both math and reading in late 2022.</p>
<p>The results showed a drop of nine points in math and four points in reading compared to 2020, the last year the test was administered. The department's information shows that those are the largest point decreases between tests recorded since 1973.</p>
<p>The test asks students to read short <strong>passages</strong> and identify the main idea or some facts. In math, students had to answer simple multiplication and geometry questions.</p>
<p>The latest test scores show that American 13-year-old students are back to their lowest level in math since 1990 and lowest reading level since 2004.</p>
<p>Math and Reading scores were no better outside the U.S. Students around the world suffered historic setbacks in reading and math. That information comes from results of the latest Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).</p>
<p>The PISA is an international comparative study of the scores of 15-year-old students on tests in reading, math and science. It is administered by OECD. Nearly 700,000 students worldwide took part in the study.</p>
<p>PISA is given every three years. The latest results showed an "<strong>unprecedented</strong> drop in performance" since 2018. The 2022 results were released on December 5. It is the first extensive study with data on how the pandemic has affected student performance around the world.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a major reason for the worldwide score drops. But science and reading scores were dropping even before the pandemic. This suggests there are other reasons for the decrease.</p>
<p>Factors such as the level of investment in education, the social value and pay levels of teachers, and educational beliefs of students have all influenced educational results, OECD found.</p>
<p><strong>Absent, missing students</strong></p>
<p>Students are not going to make gains in learning if they miss school. Education officials and activists are concerned about an increase in the number of students who are absent for many days during the school year.</p>
<p>Education policy experts call the problem "chronic absenteeism." Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing more than 10 percent out of the days in a school year.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why students miss a lot of school. Certain physical problems and mental health problems, which have increased since the pandemic, are possible causes.</p>
<p>Certain community conditions also can affect attendance, says Joshua Childs, a professor of education policy at the University of Texas at Austin. These include whether a student has safe transportation to and from school and whether the school itself is a safe environment. Childs added that if families do not feel connected with the school community or do not value education that can add to absenteeism.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of American students have also dropped out of public schools since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have essentially gone missing from schools.</p>
<p>A recent examination found an estimated 240,000 students in 21 states whose absences from school could not be explained. These students did not move out of state. They also did not sign up for private school or home-school.</p>
<p>The issue of missing students received a lot of attention in 2020 after the pandemic closed schools around the country. In the years since, however, the issue has largely become a budgeting problem.</p>
<p>There is no longer urgency to find the students who disappeared from school. Early in the pandemic, school workers would go to the students' homes to try and help them return to the classroom. Most of those efforts have ended.</p>
<p><strong>Changing technology</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic showed how useful digital technology could be for schools. But it also showed the limitations of technology in the educational setting. Millions of students were able to attend classes online and avoid spreading the virus. But many students failed to learn by such methods.</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( or UNESCO) argues against unsupervised wide use of digital tools and AI in education. A recent UNESCO report says there is little evidence that wide technology use improves learning.</p>
<p>The organization says digital educational tools can never replace the human connection of teacher and student. There is a very large divide, or gap, between rich and poor countries when it comes to digital resources</p>
<p>"Even if connectivity was <strong>universal</strong>, it would still be necessary to demonstrate ...that digital technology offers real added value in terms of effective learning," the UNESCO report says.</p>
<p>Many educators fear students will use the AI tool ChatGPT to write their reports or <strong>cheat</strong> on homework. New York City school officials started blocking the writing tool on school devices and networks in January. But other teachers are including it in the classroom.</p>
<p>Donnie Piercey is a teacher in Lexington, Kentucky. He told his fifth-grade students to try and outsmart the tool that was creating writing <strong>assignments</strong>. Piercey says his job is to prepare students for a world where knowledge of AI will be required.</p>
<p>He describes ChatGPT as just the latest technology in his 17 years of teaching that raised concerns about the possibility of cheating. Other tools include Google, Wikipedia and YouTube.</p>
<p>"As educators, we haven't <strong>figured</strong> out the best way to use artificial intelligence yet," he added. "But it's coming, whether we want it to or not."</p>

            <title>Saudi Arabia's Involvement in Sports Likely to Grow in 2024  (2023/12/27) | 沙特金元体育2024年可能继续大杀四方</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>At the beginning of 2023, Saudi Arabia's growing influence on professional golf, and sports in general, was a concern for players and their fans.<br/>
2023年初，沙特阿拉伯对职业高尔夫和整个体育运动的影响力越来越大，这引起了球员及其球迷的忧虑。</p>
<p>Twelve months later, discussions are very different. Worries about the supposed threat of "sportswashing" - using sports to improve a country's reputation – have declined. Concerns about moral issues - the line between "right" and "wrong" - have also gone down. Attention now is fixed on just how rich the Saudis might make the athletes.<br/>
12个月后，议论情况大不相同。人们对所谓的“体育洗白”（利用体育运动来提高国家声誉）威胁的担忧有所减少。对道德问题，即“对”和“错”之间界限的担忧也有所下降。现在，人们的注意力集中在沙特人可能会让运动员变得多么富有上。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What has changed?<br/>
发生了什么变化？</span></p>
<p>Two major events caused the change. On June 6, the PGA Tour announced it was looking to go into business with the Saudi group that was paying for the kingdom's LIV Golf, which the tour had labeled as a threat.<br/>
两件大事导致了这一变化。6月6日，美国职业高尔夫球巡回赛宣布，它正寻求与赞助LIV Golf的沙特组织开展业务，该巡回赛曾称其为威胁。</p>
<p>Then, six months later, Jon Rahm, the world's third-ranked professional golfer and an early resister of LIV, decided to join LIV for a deal reported to be worth about $500 million.<br/>
六个月后，世界排名第三的职业高尔夫球手、LIV的早期抵制者琼·拉姆决定加入LIV，据报道这笔交易价值约5亿美元。</p>
<p>Other important events included the continuing talks between the Saudis and leaders of professional tennis organizations. In addition, the push into soccer will bring the world's biggest sporting event, the World Cup, to Saudi Arabia in 2034.<br/>
其他重要活动包括沙特人与职业网球组织领导人之间的持续会谈。此外，进军足球将在2034年为沙特阿拉伯带来世界上最大的体育赛事世界杯。</p>
<p>
Dan Durbin is director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at the University of Southern California (USC). Durbin said of the Saudi plans: "You're investing in sports, which is one of the few growth industries in the world....It is, as far as we can see, an almost endless growth industry."<br/>
丹·德宾是南加州大学体育、媒体和社会研究所所长。德宾在谈到沙特的计划时说：“投资体育是世界上为数不多的增长型行业之一……就我们所见，这是一个几乎增长无止境的产业。”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saudi's investments<br/>
沙特的投资</span></p>
<p>In early 2022, the discussion about golf centered on Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, in LIV Golf. At the time, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson made a critical comment about Saudi Arabia related to the murder of the Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi.<br/>
2022年初，关于高尔夫的讨论集中在沙特阿拉伯公共投资基金对LIV golf的投资上。当时，六届大满贯得主菲尔·米克尔森就沙特卷入《华盛顿邮报》作家贾迈勒·卡舒吉的谋杀案发表了批评性评论。</p>
<p>Mickelson's comment set the dividing line in what was viewed as a moral question. And the discussion ignored how important Saudi Arabia is in the world economy. The Saudis gain much of their importance by supplying around 15 percent of the world's petroleum.<br/>
米克尔森的评论划下了一个道德问题的分界线。这些讨论忽略了沙特阿拉伯在世界经济中的重要性。沙特通过供应全球约15%的石油而获得了很大的重要性。</p>
<p>Besides golf, the fund offered one of soccer's biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo, $200 million to join a Saudi team. And it also owns the Premier League's Newcastle soccer club.<br/>
除了高尔夫，该基金还出资2亿美元邀请足球巨星克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多加盟了沙特球队。它还拥有英超联赛的纽卡斯尔足球俱乐部。</p>
<p>As the calendar turns to 2024, there is no sign of Saudi involvement in sports slowing. The Saudis are hosting a Formula One auto race. They are also looking to invest some $5 billion into cricket's Indian Premier League with an eye on making it bigger in other countries.<br/>
随着日历转到2024年，沙特对体育运动的参与没有放缓的迹象。沙特正在举办一场一级方程式赛车比赛。他们还希望向印度板球超级联赛投资约50亿美元，为的是扩大该项运动在其它国家的规模。</p>
<p>The ATP, which runs men's professional tennis, has a five-year deal to hold one of its biggest events in the Saudi port city of Jeddah. Talks between the Saudis and the women's tour are reportedly ongoing.<br/>
经营男子职业网球的职业网球联合会签订了一份为期五年的协议，它将在沙特港口城市吉达举办其最大的赛事之一。据报道，沙特和女子职业网球巡回赛之间的谈判正在进行中。</p>
<p>In a sign of how public discussions have changed, Billie Jean King, who fought for equal pay for women in sports, has said bringing women's tennis to the kingdom might not be all bad despite its poor record on women's rights.<br/>
比莉·让·金曾为女性在体育运动中的同工同酬而奋斗，她表示，尽管沙特在女权方面的记录不佳，但将女子网球带到沙特可能并不完全是坏事，这表明公众讨论已经发生了变化。</p>
<p>"I don't think you really change unless you engage," she said earlier this year.<br/>
她今年早些时候说：“我不认为你真的会改变，除非你参与进来。”</p>
<p>Durbin says sports is a way for the kingdom to be seen as more than an oil-producer with a bad human-rights record.<br/>
德宾说，体育运动是沙特被视为不仅仅是一个人权记录不佳的石油生产国的途径。</p>
<p>"For decades, sports has been the center of soft diplomacy," he said. "You try to create a positive response and feeling about your ethics because you're holding to the rules of sports."<br/>
他说：“几十年来，体育一直是软外交的中心。各国试图对自己的道德标准做出积极的回应和感受，因为你坚持体育规则。”</p>

            <title>Millions Infected with Dengue as Temperature Rises  (2023/12/26)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The disease dengue is spreading across the Western Hemisphere in numbers not seen since record-keeping began in 1980. Experts are warning that rising temperatures and growing cities are increasing the rate of infection.</p>
<p>More than 4 million cases have been reported throughout the Americas and the Caribbean so far this year, breaking a record set in 2019. Officials from the Bahamas to Brazil are warning of crowded health centers and new infections daily. Reports say there have been more than 2,000 deaths across the wide area.</p>
<p>Thais dos Santos is with the Pan American Health Organization, the area office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Americas. She said diseases like dengue, "provide us a really good <strong>sentinel</strong> of what is happening with climate change."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Children with dengue wait to be seen by doctors at the Mario Ortiz Children's Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Feb. 16, 2023.

<p>A lack of good <strong>sanitation</strong> and strong health systems have added to the rise in cases. But experts say <strong>droughts</strong> and floods linked to climate change are causing greater spread of the virus. That is because stored water and heavy rains appeal to mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey is chief of the dengue branch for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Puerto Rico. She noted that higher temperatures also are expanding the mosquito's habitat and helping the virus develop faster inside the mosquito. That leads to higher viral loads and a higher chance of transmission.</p>
<p>This year's Northern Hemisphere summer was the hottest ever, with August about 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial period averages. And Copernicus, the European climate service, reported that 2023 is the second hottest year on record.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 4.5 million cases of dengue had been reported as of early November. There have been more than 4,000 deaths reported in 80 countries.</p>
<p>Countries like Bangladesh are seeing a record number of cases and deaths. The government in the South Asian country has reported more than 313,700 cases and more than 1,600 deaths. Most of the deaths happened within three days of hospitalization.</p>
<p>The mosquito that carries dengue also has been identified in 22 European countries, with local spread of the disease seen in France, Italy and Spain. In August, the central African country of Chad reported its first dengue outbreak in history.</p>
<p>Dengue affects some 129 countries, with roughly half the world's population at risk, says the WHO. Infected female mosquitoes pass the virus when they feed on animals. The sickness can cause severe headaches, fever, vomiting, rash and other signs. While most infected people do not get symptoms, severe cases can lead to <strong>plasma</strong> leakage and death.</p>
<p>What is worse, experts say, repeated infections means a higher risk of developing severe dengue.</p>
<p>The Caribbean also is battling an increase in cases. The area had reported a 15 percent increase in confirmed cases by early October compared with the same period last year, says the Caribbean Public Health Agency.</p>
<p>Officials on the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique declared an epidemic in August that is still ongoing. Martinique is reporting an average of 800 cases a week on the island of some 394,000 people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jamaica and the Bahamas declared an outbreak in September followed by Barbados in October.</p>
<p>Poor countries struggle the most with dengue. Bad sanitation creates a good reproduction environment for infected mosquitoes. Poor housing conditions leave people at greater risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Dengue outbreaks can crush already poor and overworked health systems.</p>
<p>Jeremy Farra is chief scientist for the WHO. He said dengue is very difficult to treat partly because patients often delay in seeking medical care. The virus can progress so quickly, he said. Treating those with the disease requires very close patient supervision and a lot of time.</p>
<p>Farra said, "Imagine that you have a thousand people like that requiring all that <strong>delicate</strong> clinical care. It can very quickly <strong>overwhelm</strong> a system."</p>

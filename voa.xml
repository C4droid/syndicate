        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<p>Last year, 40 percent of students in Los Angeles public schools missed more than 10 percent of the school year.</p>
<p>That information comes from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which says about 429,000 students are <strong>enrolled </strong>in its schools.</p>
<p>In addition to the attendance numbers, the district's website says its officials did not know where 2,500 students were. These students stopped attending class and did not appear to enroll anywhere else.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Deneffy S&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;225;nchez, left, looks at his smartphone on a bunk bed he shares with his mother, Lilian Lopez, right, and sister, Jennifer, in a shared studio apartment in Los Angeles, Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023.

<p>Elmer Roldan is executive director of Communities in Schools of Los Angeles, a nonprofit group that aims to keep children in school. He said, "Housing is the biggest reason kids aren't going to school or we can't find them."</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press</em> (AP) recently reported on a case of one of those children whose housing situation led to problems at school.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Deneffy Sánchez has faced housing problems with his family for years. An AP reporter spoke with the teenager and his family.</p>
<p>Deneffy lives with his mother Lilian Lopez and a 3-year-old sister. Lopez had been having a hard time keeping up with monthly <strong>rent</strong> payments in an earlier apartment. So the family of three shared a small living space with Fabiola Del Castillo, someone they did not know.</p>
<p>As they fell behind on rent payments again, Del Castillo wanted to give up the apartment and pressured the family to leave. To fight the threat of losing their home, Deneffy stayed in the apartment — and missed school.</p>
<p>Federal data shows that the majority of students the government considers "homeless" have a place to stay. But the situation is often complex with shared roommates and an unsure future. In Los Angeles, the city's superintendent said last spring that 13,000 students were homeless and 2,000 of them stayed in city shelters.</p>
<p>In Deneffy's case, his family was struggling to stay in their small apartment. His father has not been with them. His mother immigrated from Guatemala 22 years ago. In 2020, after his mother gave birth to Jennifer, his sister, the family was homeless.</p>
<p>That year, schools across the country closed because of the spread of COVID-19. Deneffy tried to attend seventh-grade classes online through Zoom but said he could not pay attention. "I felt like they were judging me," he said.</p>
<p>By ninth grade, classes became more difficult, and his family did not have internet service at home. Deneffy's grades crashed. His school offered help with homework. But AP reported the boy said that he really wanted a <strong>therapist</strong>.</p>
<p>Deneffy spoke to the school's "<strong>psychiatric</strong> social worker" to see if she could help him get mental health counseling. But demand for such help increased sharply during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2021, an opinion study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 42 percent of high school students said they felt sad or hopeless a lot compared to 28 percent ten years before.</p>
<p>After leaving the apartment shared with Castillo, Deneffy's family had another bad experience sharing a place. Then they found a place where they could live without roommates through an old friend. The apartment is small and costs $1250 to rent each month. That is more than Deneffy's mother makes from government assistance and cleaning jobs.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old now has a laptop computer provided by the school and a wireless connection to help with schoolwork. He has the most trouble with writing. "I never know where to put the commas and other <strong>punctuation</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>He also sees a therapist at school once a week. But he is worried that his family's new living situation might change. His mother needs to find a full-time job to meet the rent payments.</p>
<p>Speaking of his mother, Deneffy says she tells him not to worry. "But I do," he said. "What if we don't have money, and we get kicked out again?"</p>

<p>More and more of Judy Branfman's friends and neighbors found themselves unable to <strong>afford</strong> housing in Venice Beach, a neighborhood in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So, Branfman began photographing the houses and apartments being sold, <strong>renovated</strong>, and then resold at two or three times the cost.</p>
<p>Branfman thought she should be recording the growing problem of <strong>evictions</strong> and housing in Venice Beach. The writer and activist was disappointed that Venice is losing what made it an interesting, artistic neighborhood to her.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Judy Branfman stands by a map she created as part of a gallery installation at Beyond Baroque Gallery on Nov. 3, 2023, in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-2e83-08dbdfa0e71b_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Judy Branfman stands by a map she created as part of a gallery installation at Beyond Baroque Gallery on Nov. 3, 2023, in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles.

<p>Her photo project has gained some attention. Earlier this year, Branfman started hosting community meetings where <strong>residents</strong> could share their experiences with evictions that caused them to become homeless. Some people read poems. Others expressed themselves through paintings. They started gathering information on housing and evictions.</p>
<p>Branfman's idea to take a few photos became an art exhibit called "Where Has All The (affordable) Housing Gone?"</p>
<p>"The idea was to <strong>illustrate</strong> the problem, to show what we've lost," Branfman said.</p>
<p>Venice Beach became a center of the homelessness crisis during the coronavirus pandemic in Los Angeles. The nation's second-largest city has an estimated 46,000 people who are homeless in a population of 4 million people.</p>
<p>Venice Beach has been popular for the arts for a long time. But people noticed the difference between rich and poor there as technology companies moved in and people started building costly, modern homes.</p>
<p>The nonprofit group Angeleno Project said that about 80 percent of low-income Los Angeles <strong>renters</strong> pay over half their <strong>income</strong> toward housing costs.</p>
<p>At Branfman's exhibit, her photos are displayed on a large and detailed map. The map shows many of the nearly 1,500 rent-controlled homes she said have been lost from the housing market in Venice over 20 years. In some cases, the buildings were sold to large corporations that are buying up properties and increasing rents.</p>
<p>The map and the exhibit say part of the problem is a law called the Ellis Act. The 1985 California law gave apartment owners power to evict <strong>tenants</strong> in rent-controlled buildings for redevelopment. Owners can then later require higher rents for the same apartments. "Rent-controlled" means that rents are limited by law.</p>
<p>Branfman said she suffered because of the law when she was evicted from a Venice Beach apartment in 2003.</p>
<p>"Too many tenants are afraid to fight back. And most don't know what their rights are under the law," she said. Even when tenants do bring <strong>complaints</strong>, she said, the city very rarely deals with the claims.</p>
<p>Branfman and other housing activists are hopeful that change could come with a measure that will be voted on in 2024. The measure would expand local control by overturning a 28-year-old law that bans rent control on single-family homes, condominiums and rental properties that were built after 1995.</p>

<p>Face coverings, or masks, are back on the streets of New Delhi as <strong>residents</strong> deal with an increase in air pollution.</p>
<p>The city's government has ordered primary schools to close this week and polluting vehicles and building projects are banned. A thick cover of <strong>smog</strong> hangs over New Delhi's monuments and buildings.</p>
<p>In the Indian capital, officials are struggling to reduce severe air pollution levels. Air pollution in New Delhi is a yearly and continuous health crisis that affects the lives of over 20 million in the city.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A cyclist rides amid smog in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2023.

<p>On Tuesday, the air quality index came close to the level of 400 for tiny <strong>particulate</strong> matter. That is a level considered dangerous. It is more than 10 times the level considered safe, said SAFAR, India's main environmental agency. It is the fifth straight day of bad air in the area.</p>
<p>Officials have released water <strong>sprinklers</strong> and anti-smog guns to control the pollution. They also announced a fine of $240 for drivers found using gasoline and diesel cars, buses and trucks that create smog. Meanwhile, doctors have advised residents to wear masks and avoid outdoors as much as possible.</p>
<p>Residents like 55-year-old Renu Aggarwal are worried the smog will worsen as Diwali approaches this weekend. The Hindu festival of light includes the lighting of fireworks. Aggarwal said her daughter has a <strong>pollen allergy</strong> that worsens with pollution.</p>
<p>"She cannot breathe. Even though we keep the doors and windows shut in our home, the pollution still affects her so much that even going to the washroom is difficult for her. And she gets breathless," she said.</p>
<p>New Delhi tops the list almost every year of many Indian cities with poor air quality. It gets especially bad in the winter when crops are burned in neighboring states and cooler temperatures create smoggy conditions.</p>
<p>Burning the remains of crops at the start of the winter wheat season is an important cause to the pollution in north India. Officials have been trying to prevent farmers from using the method by offering money to buy machines to turn the soil. But the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology says smoke from crop burning still accounts for 25 percent of the pollution in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Respirer Living Sciences is a group that watches air quality and other environmental signs. It said New Delhi saw a sharp 32 percent rise in tiny particles in the air between 2019 and 2020, a decrease of 44 percent in 2021, and a steady increase in 2022 and 2023.</p>

<p>Birds in North America will no longer be named after people. The American Ornithological Society announced the move Wednesday.</p>
<p>Next year, the organization will begin to rename around 80 birds found in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Colleen Handel is the organization's president. She said: "There is power in a name, and some English bird names have associations with the past that continue to be <strong>exclusionary</strong> and harmful today."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt=" Birds that will be renamed include those currently called Wilson's warbler and Wilson's snipe, both named after the 19th century naturalist Alexander Wilson. (USFWS via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-cc6a-08dbdbb71362_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"> Birds that will be renamed include those currently called Wilson's warbler and Wilson's snipe, both named after the 19th century naturalist Alexander Wilson. (USFWS via AP)</span></div>
<p>"Everyone who loves and cares about birds should be able to enjoy and study them freely," Handel added.</p>
<p>Rather than review each bird named after a person individually, all birds named after people will be renamed, the organization announced.</p>
<p>Birds that will be renamed include those currently called Wilson's warbler and Wilson's snipe. Those are both named after the 19th century naturalist Alexander Wilson. Audubon's shearwater, a seabird named for John James Audubon, also will get a new name.</p>
<p>In 2020, the organization renamed a bird that used to be named after Confederate Army General, John P. McCown. It is now called the thick-billed longspur.</p>
<p>"I'm really happy and excited about the announcement," said Emily Williams. She is an <strong>ornithologist</strong> at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. who was not involved in the decision.</p>
<p>She said debates over bird names have been happening among birdwatchers for the past several years.</p>
<p>"Naming birds based on <strong>habitat</strong> or appearance is one of the least problematic approaches," Williams said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the National Audubon Society announced that it would keep its name. Some critics argued that the group should lose its connection to John James Audubon, whose family owned slaves.</p>
<p>"The name has come to represent so much more than the work of one person," Susan Bell told <em>Audubon</em> magazine in March. She is chair of the National Audubon Society's Board of Directors. Bell added, "We must <strong>reckon with</strong> the racist <strong>legacy</strong> of John James Audubon."</p>
<p>A 2020 incident in New York's Central Park has been reported as an example of discrimination that Black people sometimes face when trying to enjoy the outdoors.</p>
<p>Christian Cooper, a Black birdwatcher, was looking for birds when he asked a white woman, Amy Cooper, to follow local rules and <strong>leash</strong> her dog. Cooper called the police and was later charged with filing a false police report. Police later dropped the charge.</p>
<p>Soon after, a group of birdwatchers organized the first Black Birders Week for Black nature lovers and scientists.</p>
<p>And a group called Bird Names for Birds sent a <strong>petition</strong> to the ornithological society urging it to create "a plan to change harmful common names" of birds.</p>

            <title>Possible New Cure for Sickle Cell Disease  (2023/11/7)</title>

<span class="datetime">06 November 2023</span><br/>
<p>A group of health experts recently announced that a new gene editing treatment for sickle cell disease was safe for patients. The treatment could provide a new cure that attacks the disease at its genetic source.</p>
<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is common in places with high cases of malaria, like Africa and India. It strikes among Black Americans, Africans, and Middle Easterners more than other groups. Scientists believe being a carrier of SCD helps protect against severe malaria.</p>
<p>People with SCD carry unhealthy blood cells that result in blockages, called blood clots. This can cause pain and damage bones and organs in the human body. The World Health Organization <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/sickle-cell-disease">said</a> many children with the most severe form of the disease die before the age of five, usually from an infection or severe blood loss.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This July 2019 image provided by the Sarah Cannon Research Institute shows Victoria Gray during a gene-editing trial for sickle cell disease.

<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics make the new treatment, called "exa-cel." The treatment involves permanently changing the genetic material, DNA, in a patient's blood cells. The goal is to help the body return to healthy blood cell production. Healthy blood cells are present at birth but abnormal cells begin to develop in people with sickle cell disease.</p>
<p>When patients receive the treatment, stem cells are removed from their blood and the gene-editing tool CRISPR is used to remove the switching gene. Patients get medicines to kill off other damaged blood-producing cells and then are given back their changed stem cells.</p>
<p>Vertex reported 46 people got the treatment in its study. Among 30 of them who had at least 18 months of observation, 29 were free of pain crises for at least a year. All 30, Vertex reported, avoided being hospitalized for pain crises for that long.</p>
<p>Victoria Gray, of Mississippi, was the first patient to test the "exa-cel" treatment. Gray told researchers at a scientific gathering earlier this year that she had suffered from pain since childhood. She described feeling "reborn" the day she got the treatment. "My children no longer have a fear of losing their mom to sickle cell disease," she said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had already found the treatment effective in a study of SCD patients. The health agency, however, was not sure if the small genetic <strong>sample</strong> size used in the study captured the entire U.S. population for sickle cell disease.</p>
<p>With the experts' findings, the FDA is likely to approve the treatment in early December for patients age 12 and older. If the treatment is approved, Vertex has also proposed to follow up with patients to study its safety for another 15 years.</p>
<p>Vertex has not said how much the treatment will cost.</p>
<p>But the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review <a class="wsw__a" href="https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ICER_SCD_revisedreport_071323.pdf">estimates</a> the cost could be around $2 million for the treatment. By comparison, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35575558/" target="_blank">research earlier this year</a> showed medical costs for sickle cell treatments, from birth to age 65, could add up to $1.7 million.</p>
<p>Dr. Allison King of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri cares for children and young adults with sickle cell disease. She told the Associated Press that the new treatments would be costly.</p>
<p>"But if you think about it," she said, "how much is it worth for someone to feel better and not be in pain and not be in the hospital all the time?"</p>

<p>The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Monday that more than 10,000 Palestinians have died in the current conflict with Israel. The agency, however, does not differentiate the number of deaths as civilians or combatants.</p>
<p>The conflict began after October 7, when Hamas militants attacked Israel. They killed at least 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians. Hamas also kidnapped an estimated 240 people.</p>
<p>Israel has answered with airstrikes that it says target militants in the territory. Last week, Israeli military forces entered northern Gaza intending to drive Hamas militants from power. Experts expect the number of deaths will rise as street fighting starts in the heavily populated area.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Palestinians go through the rubble of a building in Khan Yunis on November 6, 2023, amid the ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.

<p>Since foreign reporters and independent organizations are barred from Gaza, the Hamas-run Health Ministry is the only official source for <strong>casualties</strong> in the territory. The United Nations and other international organizations said the ministry has made a <strong>good-faith</strong> effort to count the number of deaths under difficult conditions.</p>
<p>Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization said that the ministry's numbers might not be "perfectly <strong>accurate</strong>." But he added, "They largely <strong>reflect</strong> the level of death and injury."</p>
<p>The recent explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza showed how difficult it was to estimate the cause and the number of deaths in the conflict.</p>
<p>Hamas militants blamed an Israeli airstrike for the explosion. Gaza's Health Ministry first reported 200 to 300 deaths in the explosion. Half an hour later, the agency revised the number to 500. The following day, it changed the number to 471.</p>
<p>Israel, the United States and French officials, however, said the explosion was caused by a misfired rocket. And American intelligence estimates the number of deaths at the hospital parking area to have been between 100 and 300.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Gaza's Health Ministry Count the Numbers?</strong></p>
<p>The Health Ministry says it receives a flow of data from every hospital in the territory.</p>
<p>Hospital officials in Gaza told <em>The Associated Press</em> (AP) that they keep records of every wounded person and every dead. And they enter the information in a computerized system shared with the ministry.</p>
<p>Ashraf al-Qidra is a spokesperson for the ministry. He said when the flow of information is broken because of internet connection or electricity, the agency calls the hospitals to get numbers. The agency also collects data from other sources, including the Palestinian Red Crescent.</p>
<p>Last week, the ministry released a 212-page report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far, including their names, identification numbers, ages and gender. A copy of the report, shared with the AP, names 6,747 Palestinians and says an additional 281 bodies have not yet been identified.</p>
<p>The list does not say where a person was killed. It also does not differentiate between civilians and fighters or say how they were killed – whether from Israeli airstrikes or Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of "Israeli aggression."</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Richard Hecht is an Israeli military spokesman. He said of the report, "When the Hamas health agency comes out with the numbers, take it with a pinch of salt." In other words, he dismissed the report as something unlikely to be truthful. But he repeatedly refused to state the number of Palestinian deaths.</p>
<p><strong>How reliable are Gaza's numbers?</strong></p>
<p>International news agencies, humanitarian workers and rights groups have often used the ministry's numbers when an independent source is not available.</p>
<p>"These figures are professionally done and have proven to be <strong>reliable</strong>," said Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's Israel and Palestine director. He noted that the numbers do not differentiate between civilians' and fighters' deaths.</p>
<p>After the conflict, the U.N. humanitarian office usually publishes final numbers on deaths based on its research into medical records. In many cases, the U.N.'s counts have been fairly close to the Gaza Health Ministry's numbers.</p>
<p>After the 2008 war, the ministry reported 1,440 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 1,385.</p>
<p>In the 2014 war, the ministry reported 2,310 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 2,251.</p>
<p>And in the 2021 war, the ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 256.</p>

<p>Colombia will try to control its population of more than 100 hippopotamuses, large animals from Africa.</p>
<p>The South American country aims to control the big animals using several methods. Officials might <strong>sterilize</strong> the animals through a medical operation. They might move the hippos to other countries, or possibly <strong>euthanize</strong> them, the government said recently.</p>
<p>The animals' ancestors were brought to the country by the late Pablo Escobar in the 1980s. Escobar was the leader of an illegal drug operation in Colombia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Hippos float in the lagoon at Hacienda Napoles Park, once the private estate of drug organization chief Pablo Escobar who imported three female hippos and one male years ago in Puerto Triunfo, Colombia on February 4, 2021.

(AP Photo/Fernando Vergara, File)</span></div>
<p>The hippos have spread from Escobar's home to nearby rivers where they have reproduced. They have no natural <strong>predators</strong> in Colombia and the government has declared them as an invasive animal that could hurt the environment.</p>
<p>Officials estimate there are 169 hippos in Colombia and that many of them are in the Magdalena River area. They estimate that if no measures are taken, there could be 1,000 by 2035.</p>
<p>Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said the first step of the plan will be to sterilize 40 hippos each year and this will begin soon.</p>
<p>The method is costly. Each sterilization costs about $9,800. And there are risks for the hippos, including reactions to medicines or death, as well as risks to health officials, the ministry said. The hippos live across a large area. They are territorial and aggressive.</p>
<p>Experts say sterilization alone is not enough to control the growth of the invasive animals. The government announced in March that it is planning to possibly move the animals to other countries.</p>
<p>Muhamad said Colombian officials have contacted officials in Mexico, India, and the Philippines, and they are considering a plan to send 60 hippos to India.</p>
<p>"We are working on the <strong>protocol</strong> for the export of the animals," she said. "We are not going to export a single animal if there is no <strong>authorization</strong> from the environmental authority of the other country."</p>
<p>As a last means to control the population, the ministry is creating a protocol to euthanize the animals.</p>
<p>A group of hippos was brought in the 1980s to Hacienda Nápoles. The place was Escobar's private zoo. Now it receives many visitors after his death in 1993. Most of the animals live freely in rivers there and reproduce without control.</p>
<p>The people of the nearby Puerto Triunfo have become used to hippos sometimes walking freely around the town.</p>
<p>However, scientists warn that the hippos' waste pollutes the rivers and could affect the environment where other large animals, like manatees and capybaras, live.</p>

欧洲的Facebook和Instagram用户可以选择在不看广告的情况下使用社交媒体服务。</p>
<p>However, they will have to pay for that option. Meta, the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram, recently announced the new choice, which is meant to comply with Europe's data privacy rules.<br/>
然而，他们将不得不为这一选择付费。Facebook和Instagram的母公司Meta最近宣布了这个新的选项，它旨在遵守欧洲的数据隐私规则。</p>
<p>Starting this month, users on desktop browsers will pay about $11 a month while iOS and Android users will pay $14 a month. Meta said in a blog that the price difference between the versions is the result of higher costs linked to the Apple and Google app stores.<br/>
从本月开始，桌面浏览器用户每月将支付约11美元，而iOS和Android用户每月支付14美元。Meta在一篇博客中表示，两个版本之间的价格差异是苹果和谷歌应用商店相关成本增加的结果。</p>
<p>The monthly payment will cover all linked Facebook and Instagram accounts until March 1, 2024. On that date, Meta will require $6 to $8 for each additional account depending on the system used. Meta released details of the plan late last month.<br/>
每月付款将覆盖所有链接的Facebook和Instagram账户，直至2024年3月1日为止。在那一天，Meta将根据所使用的系统，要求每个额外的账户付款6至8美元。Meta上个月底公布了该计划的细节。</p>
<p>Meta said it is introducing the new pay option after a ruling by the EU's top court. The court said Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users under EU data privacy rules.<br/>
Meta表示，在欧盟最高法院作出裁决后，它推出了新的付费选项。该法院表示，根据欧盟数据隐私规则，Meta在向用户展示广告之前必须首先获得同意。</p>
<p>Meta advertises products and services to individual users based on their online activity. The EU ruling affects the company's ability to make money from its advertising methods.<br/>
Meta根据个人用户的在线活动向他们宣传产品和服务。欧盟的裁决影响了该公司通过广告方式赚钱的能力。</p>
<p>Meta said in a statement, that the paid option "balances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people."<br/>
Meta在一份声明中表示，付费选项“平衡了欧洲监管机构的要求，同时为用户提供了选择，并允许Meta继续为所有人服务。”</p>
<p>Users aged 18 and older in the EU's 27 member countries, and also Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein will still have the choice to continue using Facebook or Instagram with ads.<br/>
欧盟27个成员国以及瑞士、挪威、冰岛和列支敦士登的18岁及以上用户仍可以选择继续使用有广告的Facebook或Instagram。</p>
<p>Meta said it is considering how to "provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience" under the European privacy ruling.<br/>
Meta表示，它正在考虑如何根据欧洲隐私裁决“为青少年提供有用和负责任的广告体验”。</p>
<p>On November 1, the European data regulator, the European Data Protection Board, announced that it would extend a ban on "behavioral advertising" on Facebook and Instagram. The ban covers all 30 countries in the EU and the European Economic Area. The ban was first put in place by non-EU member Norway. The northern European country has ordered Meta to pay thousands of dollars each day since the middle of August for breaking the country's privacy rules.<br/>
11月1日，欧洲数据监管机构欧洲数据保护委员会宣布，将延长对Facebook和Instagram上“行为广告”的禁令。该禁令涵盖欧盟和欧洲经济区的所有30个国家。该禁令最初由非欧盟成员国挪威实施。自8月中旬以来，这个北欧国家已下令Meta每天支付数千美元罚款，因为它违反了该国的隐私规则。</p>
<p>Behavioral advertising targets users by collecting their personal data. The EU's ban on such advertising is considered a setback for Meta.<br/>
行为广告通过收集用户的个人数据来锁定用户。欧盟对此类广告的禁令被认为是Meta的一次挫折。</p>
<p>In a statement, Meta said it believes in an "ad-supported internet." But the company said it respects "the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations," and aims to comply with them.<br/>
Meta在一份声明中表示，它相信“有广告支持的互联网”。但该公司表示，它尊重“这些不断发展的欧洲法规的精神和目的”，并致力于遵守这些法规。</p>

<p>Antarctica has not always been a land of ice and snow. Earth's southernmost continent once was home to rivers and forests full of life.</p>
<p>Scientists are using satellite observations and radar imagery to look deep under the ice. The researchers report finding a large ancient <strong>landscape</strong> buried under the continent's ice sheet. It is full of valleys and <strong>ridges</strong>, shaped by rivers before being covered by glaciers long ago.</p>
<p>The landscape is located in East Antarctica's Wilkes Land area bordering the Indian Ocean. It covers an area about the size of Belgium. The researchers said the landscape appears to date to at least 14 million years ago and perhaps beyond 34 million years ago, when Antarctica entered its deep freeze.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An illustration shows how a landscape the size of Belgium located in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica would appear if the thick ice sheet covering it were lifted away.

(Stewart Jamieson, Durham University/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>"The landscape is like a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the past," said Stewart Jamieson. He is a professor of glaciology at Durham University in England and co-leader of the study published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to know what this lost world might have looked like before the ice came along, but it was certainly warmer back then," Jamieson added. "Depending how far back in time you go, you might have had climates that <strong>ranged</strong> anywhere from the climate of present-day Patagonia through to something more approaching <strong>tropical</strong>."</p>
<p>Such an environment likely would have been populated by wildlife, Jamieson said. But the area's fossil record is too incomplete to know which animals may have lived there.</p>
<p>The ice above the ancient landscape measures about 2.2 kilometers to 3 kilometers thick, said study co-leader Neil Ross. He is a professor of polar science and environmental geophysics at Newcastle University in England.</p>
<p>The researchers said the surface of the planet Mars is better known than the earth surface below the ice in Antarctica. They said one way to learn more would be to drill through the ice and take a piece<strong> </strong>of the earth below. This could uncover evidence showing ancient life, as was done with samples taken in Greenland dating back two million years ago.</p>
<p>Some earlier studies have uncovered ancient landscapes beneath Antarctica's ice including mountains. But the landscape discovered in the new study was the first of its kind.</p>
<p>Right before 34 million years ago, Antarctica's landscape and wildlife was likely similar to today's cold temperate rainforests. That includes places like Tasmania, New Zealand and South America's Patagonia area, Ross added.</p>
<p>Antarctica was once part of the Gondwana supercontinent that also included what is now Africa, South America, Australia, the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. But it eventually split off in a process called plate tectonics.</p>
<p>Jamieson said the researchers think that when Antarctica's climate was warmer, rivers flowed toward a continental coastline that was created as the other land masses broke away. When the climate cooled, he said, some small glaciers formed on hills next to the rivers, with valleys deepening as glaciers <strong>eroded</strong>.</p>
<p>When the climate cooled even more, an ice sheet grew which covered the whole continent, Jamieson added. Eventually, "the landscape got preserved, likely for 34 million years."</p>

            <title>Native Americans Work to Keep Sheep Herding Tradition as Climate Changes  (2023/11/6)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">05 November 2023</span><br/>
<p>Members of the Native American Navajo tribe in Arizona have been raising sheep for over 500 years.</p>
<p>The Navajo started working with sheep when Spanish colonists brought the animals to North America. They raised them for meat to eat and wool to keep warm. And it helped turn the Southwest into a center of economic activity.</p>
<p>But that way of life is in danger of ending.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nikyle Begay tends a flock of sheep Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, on the Navajo Nation in Ganado, Ariz. (AP Photo/John Locher)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/35057e5c-88bc-4f7c-a11b-1efbd4802645_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Nikyle Begay tends a flock of sheep Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, on the Navajo Nation in Ganado, Ariz. (AP Photo/John Locher)</span></div>
<p>Navajo people are raising fewer sheep for several reasons: it is harder to get a permit to do so, younger people are not interested in being <strong>shepherds</strong> and climate change is making it harder to get food and water for the sheep.</p>
<p>In past years, Navajo families in the large western states of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico raised hundreds of sheep. The sheep were of the well-known Churro <strong>breed</strong>. Now, many families are only raising only a few. Some have completely given up.</p>
<p>Amy Begaye is 25. She has been working with sheep since she was a girl. At first, her family gave her small jobs when it was time to <strong>butcher</strong> the sheep. She collected their blood in a container and held their legs. But now, she competes in butchering competitions.</p>
<p>At a recent competition called the Miss Navajo Nation <strong>pageant</strong>, she had to cut the sheep into parts in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>She said she respects the work of butchers.</p>
<p>"We butcher the sheep because it is a way of our life," said Begaye, who won the competition. "That's how my ancestors were able to provide food for their families."</p>
<p>There is another Navajo family called the Begays, and they work with sheep.</p>
<p>On most days, Jay Begay, Sr. takes the sheep out to <strong>graze</strong> near the community of Rocky Ridge, Arizona. He uses a walking stick for support and takes dogs along to keep the sheep moving in the right direction. The family had about 200 sheep in the past but have since reduced their numbers to 50.</p>
<p>His son, Jay Begay, Jr. said a friend told him, "You can't blame people for not wanting to work this hard." Begay added that it is harder now because of climate change.</p>
<p>A long stretch of dry weather called a drought has reduced the number of sheep. The Navajo Department of Agriculture said there were about 200,000 sheep in 2017. The next count is in 2024 and they expect the number to be lower.</p>
<p>Water is hard to find and a recent Supreme Court decision said the U.S. government is not required to find water for the Navajo <strong>reservation</strong>.</p>
<p>Valentina Clisto is a past pageant winner, like Amy Begaye. She said when she visited other Navajo communities, the people complained about the lack of water. She said dry weather means the sheep cannot find grass to eat. Instead, those who raise the animals must pay for costly food.</p>
<p>Lester Craig remembers when his family had 600 sheep. His mother would sell their wool to buy school clothes.</p>
<p>Craig stopped raising sheep because his family lives on land polluted by a nearby uranium mine. An accident in 1979 made their water unusable. He now has to travel about 30 minutes to a filling station to get water for his family and the few animals they have left.</p>
<p>In addition to climate change, pollution and water problems, Navajo members say the U.S. government is restricting the number of animals that can live on the land. Some have to wait for years for grazing permits.</p>
<p>Meranda Laughter said her family had 300 sheep five years ago. They only have 10 now.</p>
<p>Although many worry about the future, Laughter is hopeful. She said more education and better land management can eliminate some of the recent problems. She added that the land just needs time to heal and recover.</p>
<p>"We just need to give the land time to breathe," she said.</p>

            <title>This Miami University Is Not in Florida  (2023/11/5)</title>

<span class="datetime">04 November 2023</span><br/>
<p>Valerie Do of Vietnam is in her third year of college at Miami University in the Midwestern U.S. state of Ohio.</p>
<p>The school has about 19,000 students, including about 1,000 international students. It has a good reputation for giving students an <strong>authentic</strong> college experience. The small city of Oxford is pretty in the autumn and spring. The brick school buildings are arranged on wide green spaces with walking paths.</p>
<p>But Miami University is definitely not in Florida and not close to any ocean beaches. The University of Miami is in Coral Gables, Florida, and about 15 kilometers from the famous beaches.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An aerial view of the Miami University campus in Ohio." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-4280-08dbdc725620_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An aerial view of the Miami University campus in Ohio.</span></div>
<p>Do only found out, after she was accepted, that the school she had <strong>applied</strong> to was the one in Ohio. Some international students and those who work with international students say these kinds of mistakes are common. For example, one international student remembered being <strong>confused</strong> by the difference between Washington, D.C., and the northwestern state of Washington.</p>
<p>Do recently got attention from news websites such as <em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.insider.com/glad-i-accidentally-went-to-ohio-university-instead-of-florida-2023-10" target="_blank">Insider </a></em>and the <em>Daily Mail</em> after telling her story on the social media site TikTok (@dankgiao).</p>
<p>Do often uses TikTok to discuss her experiences as an international student. One of the videos shows her explaining how she learned to pronounce difficult English words. In another, she discussed the <strong>costumes</strong> she wore during the Halloween holiday in 2021, 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Viral video</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Do made a video about her discovery that Miami University was in Ohio, not Florida. About 2 million people watched it.</p>
<p>"I didn't <strong>realize</strong> it was in Ohio until I got the acceptance letter," she said. "I basically went through the whole application process without knowing it's in Ohio."</p>
<p>Many commenters offered sympathy that she was going to apple <strong>orchards</strong> instead of beaches this autumn. But in a follow-up post, she said she was happy with her experience in Ohio.</p>
<p>Do said she went to Miami for a number of reasons, including a good financial aid offer, "the <strong>vibe</strong> of the school" and the business program.</p>
<p>She said Miami looks like the colleges shown on TV and in movies like <em>Animal House</em>.</p>
<p>Dan Sinetar works with international students at Miami University. He and his <strong>colleagues</strong> help students like Do feel comfortable once they arrive on campus.</p>
<p>Sinetar said many international students make the decision to come to Miami without visiting. So, he helps to "set the expectations" of what it is like to live in southwestern Ohio before they arrive.</p>
<p>He said some international students worry about how they can find food they are familiar with, so the office tells them about food stores with products from around the world. But other issues are more complicated.</p>
<p>"You know, race and ethnicity is a big topic in the U.S. and obviously impacts how people might <strong>engage</strong> with you. But there's many international students who might be coming from a country culture where they don't have those issues."</p>
<p>Before students arrive in the U.S., Sinetar said, Miami works to help them learn about what they should expect. The school has <strong>peer</strong> <strong>orientation</strong> leaders who help new international students get comfortable. Do, in fact, is one of them.</p>
<p>Sinetar said it is difficult to move across the world for school. "For many international students, it is their first time living away from home," he said.</p>
<p>Sinetar said that he and others at Miami often hear students discuss the Ohio and Florida confusion. One reason for this, he thinks, is that the international students often work with education agencies that help them <strong>apply</strong> to colleges.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," he said, "students are a little disconnected from the process."</p>
<p><strong>Reactions from international students</strong></p>
<p>Arkar Chen is from Myanmar. He attended college in Los Angeles and now works for a computer software company in New Jersey.</p>
<p>"The agency probably thought she knew she was applying to the university in Ohio and didn't think to tell her that," Chen said.</p>
<p>He said he did not use an agency and as a result, he was more prepared for his time in Los Angeles. However, he still had some surprises.</p>
<p>"From one neighborhood to the next, it can be very different," he said. Chen noted that Myanmar is a poor country, and he did not expect to see so many people in the U.S. living in poverty.</p>
<p>"In pop culture, when you mention L.A., you know people think about Hollywood the beach and stuff like that. The good images. But in reality, it is not so much different (from Myanmar). I guess you could call it a <strong>culture shock</strong>."</p>
<p>Chen said it would be smart for international students to think about choosing an American university close to where family or friends live — in case the culture shock is too strong.</p>
<p>"Because having someone able to help you is really invaluable, especially when you came alone to a foreign environment," he said.</p>
<p>Another former international student is Christian Cao from Vietnam. He currently lives in Toledo, Ohio, close to the border with Michigan. He is an engineer who works with robotic systems in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>He had not heard of Do before the recent stories. He said he did not think her situation is very common for international students in 2023, but he understands how the confusion could happen.</p>
<p>Cao said young people in Vietnam know about most major universities in the U.S. But 10 years ago, there were not many education agencies visiting Vietnam and <strong>recruiting</strong> students for schools in the U.S.</p>
<p>He agreed, it is still possible that not everyone would know there is a Miami University in Ohio.</p>
<p>By the time Do understood Miami was in Ohio, Cao said, "She already got accepted, she already got the scholarship. It would be a waste of time and money trying to find another university."</p>
<p>But, as Cao said, "Maybe it's not the life she expected, but it is not bad at all. She's making friends and still making progress."</p>
<p><strong>Beaches overrated?</strong></p>
<p>Cao said a student's college experience depends on what they are hoping for after they graduate. In his case, he was interested in studying engineering, so he did not mind that Toledo, Ohio did not have a big nightlife.</p>
<p>"If you're a person like me, I don't party at all," Cao said. "I just made friends and spent most of my time doing what I wanted to do at home...Ohio would be a great place for me."</p>
<p>Cao said life in Vietnam and other Asian countries is very different from life in the U.S. Young people spend a lot of time studying and living at home.</p>
<p>"When you move to America you break out of your shell," he said. "You experience a lot of new things and it's a big step up from your regular life."</p>
<p>Cao went on to say "it doesn't matter where you are, you could be at a small university in Alabama. It's just a huge step up in terms of learning and <strong>adulting</strong>."</p>
<p>Sinetar of Miami said one way students can learn about life in America is through the school's program of matching international students with American families.</p>
<p>He said local families who want to meet people from other parts of the world can sign up to spend time with the students.</p>
<p>They attend events together on campus and visit American homes.</p>
<p>Cao said he could see how that kind of activity might be more appealing in Oxford, Ohio, than in a city such as Dallas, Texas. Dallas has a large international community, Cao said.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Sinetar said, "there are these really deep relationships that are formed. Sometimes the international students have said ‘yes, I look at these people like an aunt, uncle or grandparent.'"</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On today's show, we will be talking about an animal that is as impressive and beautiful as it is useful -- the horse.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Abraham Gajon, 31, a paramedic, pets a horse named Linda during a therapy session at Miguel Hidalgo's center in Mexico City, Mexico on October 16, 2020. (REUTERS/Edgard Garrido)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/093e0000-0a00-0242-30ba-08da05d73da4_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Abraham Gajon, 31, a paramedic, pets a horse named "Linda" during a therapy session at Miguel Hidalgo's center in Mexico City, Mexico on October 16, 2020.

<p>Today's expression is <u>straight from the horse's mouth</u>. "Straight from the horse's mouth" is about the way we get information and — with this expression — that means directly.</p>
<p>When we hear something from the source, we can say we heard it <u>first-hand</u>. It is coming from a <strong>primary </strong>source.</p>
<p>When we use this expression, we can drop the word "straight" if necessary. So, if you hear something <u>from the horse's mouth</u>, you hear it from the person who has direct personal knowledge of the information.</p>
<p>For example, a co-worker of mine, Andrew, likes to play the piano. But don't take my word for it, let's hear it straight from the horse's mouth.</p>
<p><em>ANDREW: I really like to play the piano. </em></p>
<p>Thanks, Andrew!</p>
<p>The opposite of this expression would be <u>through the </u><a class="wsw__a" href="file:///C:/Users/mritter/Downloads/The%20opposite%20of%20this%20expression%20would%20be%20through%20the%20grapevine.%20That%20is%20a%20very%20indirect%20way%20to%20get%20information">grapevine</a>. That is a very indirect way to get information.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about <strong>origin</strong>. Experts are not sure how this expression started. However, there are two common explanations.</p>
<p>One traditional explanation is about buying horses. Before buying a horse, a possible buyer would look into the horse's mouth. This is because you can tell a bit about a horse's health and age from its <strong>gums</strong> and teeth.</p>
<p>Another explanation involves horse racing. At the horse races, people talk about which horses will win and which ones will lose. The most valuable opinions are from the people who know the horses the best – the riders and trainers. Since you can't ask the horse, these people are the next best thing. "Straight from the horse's mouth" suggests the most knowledgeable source of information.</p>
<p>So, this expression can also mean from a <strong>reliable </strong>source. The information is coming from a trustworthy person. It may even be the <strong>definitive </strong>source, meaning the best authority.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear the expression used in another example:</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, guess what? Stella is moving to Toronto! She's so excited.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Are you sure? She just bought a house a year ago. </em></p>
<p><em>A: She told me herself last night over dinner. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I just can't believe it. I mean, she also just got a <strong>promotion</strong> and a raise at her job. It doesn't make sense. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, whether it makes sense or not, that's what she told me. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Maybe you misheard her. </em></p>
<p><em>A: I didn't. I heard it straight from the horse's mouth – Stella's!</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have on the show today.</p>
<p>If anyone asks you where you learned this expression, tell them you heard it <u>straight from the horse's mouth</u> – from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Lyndon Johnson. He was the vice president under John F. Kennedy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Lyndon B. Johnson" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/8123fb53-bcd5-4344-a112-241d62aa024c_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Lyndon B. Johnson</span></div>
<p>Many Americans recognize Johnson from a photograph of his swearing-in on November 22, 1963.</p>
<p>Kennedy had just been shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas. Johnson and his wife also were visiting the city.</p>
<p>After doctors announced that Kennedy had died, the Johnsons were taken to the presidential airplane. There, Johnson took the oath of office as president.</p>
<p>Men wearing suits look on, while three women stand around him. His wife, Lady Bird Johnson, is at one side. Former first lady Jackie Kennedy is at the other. She is still wearing clothing covered with her husband's blood. The judge who is administering the oath, Sarah Hughes, stands in front of Lyndon Johnson. She holds a prayer book on which Johnson places one hand and swears to follow the Constitution.</p>
<p>The photograph showed the American people that the federal government could and would continue in an orderly way.</p>
<p>But Johnson's position was difficult. Many people were shocked and in mourning for the <strong>assassinated</strong> president.</p>
<p>But as the conflict in Vietnam increased, and some Americans rejected Johnson's reforms, he found his position difficult again.In the next election, Johnson was elected president in his own right.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Lyndon Baines Johnson was born in Texas, where his family had lived for generations. A town called Johnson was even named after his relatives.</p>
<p>Lyndon was the oldest of five children. His mother was a teacher and writer, and his father was a farmer and political leader.</p>
<p>In time, the Johnson family experienced financial difficulties. They had little money to give their children much of an education, but Lyndon was able to attend a teaching college.</p>
<p>Johnson excelled as a teacher. He also learned from his students. Many were even poorer than he was. They also faced discrimination because they came from Mexican families. Johnson promised to help them.</p>
<p>But he found he could do more to improve people's lives as a politician than as a teacher.</p>
<p>He volunteered for some political campaigns, became an aide to a member of the United States Congress, and in time became a member of Congress himself.</p>
<p>Along the way, he married a woman named Claudia Taylor. But everyone called her Lady Bird. They went on to have two daughters.</p>
<p>Johnson served for 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1948, he was narrowly elected to the Senate, becoming one of the two senators from the state of Texas.</p>
<p>From there, Johnson rose quickly. He took on increasingly important jobs in the Senate. By 1954, he was the Senate majority leader – the Democratic Party's top spokesman in the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate website notes that the person with that job needs to be able to work well with others, especially members of other parties.</p>
<p>Historians also note that Johnson worked very hard, and was always prepared.</p>
<p>A well-known biography of Johnson is called "Master of the Senate." The book describes Johnson as extremely <strong>ambitious</strong>, sometimes <strong>cruel</strong>, and often willing to praise others to get what he wanted. At the same time, he could be very concerned about other people's well-being.</p>
<p>In other words, the picture of Johnson is a complicated one.</p>
<p>In 1960, he competed against John F. Kennedy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Johnson lost that race – but the party asked him to be their vice presidential candidate instead.</p>
<p>Johnson agreed, not knowing that in a little more than three years, he would enter the White House as president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>After being sworn-in, Johnson used his political experience in the Senate to pass a number of reforms. They were aimed at carrying on, in his words, a "War on Poverty."</p>
<p>The new laws created healthcare and education programs. They also used federal money to make food less costly for some people, and to train workers for jobs.</p>
<p>Johnson also continued the work Kennedy began by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act made <strong>segregation</strong> because of race, religion, or national origin illegal.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act also made it illegal for employers to discriminate against someone because of race, religion, national origin, or <strong>gender</strong>.</p>
<p>The reforms had their critics, then and today. But in the presidential election of 1964, Johnson won "by the widest margin of popular votes in American history." Historian Kent Germany says that vote gave the Democrats a rare opening "to pass a comprehensive liberal program."</p>
<p><br/>
<strong>Presidency after 1964</strong></p>
<p>Johnson had a name for such a program. He called it the "Great Society." He said the United States should aim not only to be a rich and powerful society, but also to "end poverty and racial injustice."</p>
<p>Johnson followed his earlier reforms with others. They sought to prevent crime, reduce pollution, support the arts, make roads safer, and protect American <strong>consumers</strong> against bad products. His administration also created an immigration policy that valued family members, skilled workers, and refugees.</p>
<p>Johnson also signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It sought to lift the barriers that had long prevented African-American men and women from exercising their right to vote.</p>
<p>Later, Johnson removed legal discrimination in the process of buying and renting homes.</p>
<p>Together, these actions have linked Johnson to the civil rights movement in the minds of many Americans. Yet Johnson is also strongly linked to another part of U.S. history, often known simply as "Vietnam."</p>
<p>Earlier presidents had ordered U.S. military action in the conflict between North and South Vietnam. Since 1950, Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy had slowly increased the American intervention. Their goal was to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>President Johnson continued Kennedy's policies. He also received the support of Congress to do whatever was necessary to protect U.S. forces and "prevent further aggression" by North Vietnam's communist government.</p>
<p>Yet, when he was a presidential candidate in 1964, Johnson promised not to increase U.S. involvement and send young Americans to fight in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The opposite happened.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, Johnson called on hundreds of thousands of additional U.S. troops to fight on the ground and in the air. The North Vietnamese fought back, both on the battle field and politically.</p>
<p>In time, the American public withdrew their support of the struggle and their support for the president.</p>
<p>By early 1968, Johnson had become deeply unpopular with voters. His party lost seats in Congress, and Johnson lost his ability to persuade lawmakers to support the measures he proposed.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. economy was showing signs of weakness, partly because of the costs of the conflict in Vietnam and government spending at home.</p>
<p>As the presidential nominating process began in early 1968, Johnson was permitted to seek another four-year term. But he announced that he would not seek or accept his party's nomination.</p>
<p>Shortly after, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot and killed. Angered by his murder, people in more than 100 cities rioted.</p>
<p>Then, in June, John Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, was also assassinated. Kennedy had been competing for the Democrats' nomination for president.</p>
<p>His death, and Johnson's withdrawal, added to the divisions in the Democratic Party. Several groups gathered to protest at the party's nominating convention in Chicago. The meeting ended in violent clashes between protesters and police.</p>
<p>By the time Johnson left office in January 1969, his party had lost control of the White House, and many Americans believed the country was in <strong>disarray</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>After he left the presidency, Johnson returned to his home in Texas. He wrote his memories about his White House years, and made preparations for his presidential library.</p>
<p>But he did not live much longer. He died in 1973, hours before the U.S. involvement in Vietnam officially came to a close.</p>
<p>Johnson was a complex person, and his image in the mind of many Americans is just as complicated. His policies opened new paths for many people, but also led to years of death and destruction in Vietnam.</p>
<p>As a president, he acted powerfully and often independently, and succeeded in passing an unusually large number of reforms. But he also failed to persuade many Americans to accept some of those measures.</p>
<p>Supporters of the free market especially strongly rejected the government controls Johnson enacted.</p>
<p>Even some in his Democratic Party, which Johnson had controlled for years, lost faith in him. In 1964, anti-war activists changed his campaign slogan, "All the way with LBJ." Instead, they said, "Part of the way with LBJ."</p>
<p>And by 1968, they were saying, "Hey, Hey, LBJ. How many kids did you kill today?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>University of South Dakota law professor Sean Kammer's friends told him they were unsure about the seriousness of his upcoming class on musical performer Taylor Swift.<br/>
南达科他大学法学教授肖恩·坎默的朋友告诉他，他们不确定他即将开设的关于音乐表演者泰勒·斯威夫特的课程的严肃性。</p>
<p>"I understand this sounds ridiculous, at least at first glance," said Kammer, a Taylor Swift fan, or Swiftie, himself. "But it's not."<br/>
作为泰勒·斯威夫特粉丝的坎默说：“我理解这听起来很荒谬，至少乍一看是这样，但事实并非如此。”</p>
<p>Kammer's class, called the Taylor Swift effect, is planned for the spring. It is believed to be the first law school class based on the famous American singer.<br/>
坎默计划在春季开设的课程名为泰勒·斯威夫特效应。据信，这是第一门以这位著名美国歌手为原型的法学院课程。</p>
<p>After attending a Swift concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in June, Kammer said he was inspired to develop the writing class. It is available for second- and third-year law students.<br/>
今年6月，坎默参加了斯威夫特在明尼苏达州明尼阿波利斯市的一场演唱会，他说自己受到启发开发这门写作课程。这么课程将向法律系大二和大三学生开放。</p>
<p>The class will study the artist's dealings with the law, including her rerecording of six albums and related copyright problems, Kammer said.<br/>
坎默说，该课程将研究这位艺术家对法律问题的处理，包括她重新录制的六张专辑和相关的版权问题。</p>
<p>It will also examine how an individual's experiences and beliefs shape how they understand the law – much like how there are different understandings of her songs.<br/>
它还将考察个人的经历和信仰如何影响他们对法律的理解——就像人们对她的歌曲有不同的理解一样。</p>
<p>Law classes about popular culture are not uncommon. They also bring attention to schools that offer them. The television show The Wire inspired a number of criminal law classes over the years. In 2022, the University of Virginia School of Law offered a class on corporate law based on the show Succession.<br/>
关于流行文化的法律课并不少见。它们也引起了人们对提供这类课程的学校的关注。这些年来，电视节目《火线》激发了许多刑法课程的灵感。2022年，弗吉尼亚大学法学院在《继承》节目的基础上开设了一门公司法课程。</p>
<p>Law classes centered on a single public person are rare, however. But Georgia State University College of Law is currently offering a class based on the legal life of musician Rick Ross.<br/>
然而，以一个公众人物为中心的法律课程并不多见。但佐治亚州立大学法学院目前正在开设一门以音乐家里克·罗斯的法律生活为基础的课程。</p>
<p>Boston University law professor Jessica Silbey helped write a book on popular culture and the law. She said students are usually more interested when they study subjects such as sports, new technology and famous people.<br/>
波士顿大学法学教授杰西卡·西尔贝帮助撰写了一本关于流行文化和法律的书。她说，学生们通常在学习体育、新技术和名人等科目时更感兴趣。</p>
<p>Silbey teaches Swift's album rerecordings in her copyright class to teach about contract law in the music business. She said the singer's success story and what she has dealt with provide good lessons in the law.<br/>
西尔贝在她的版权课上通过讲述斯威夫特重新录制专辑来讲授音乐行业的合同法。她说，这位歌手的成功经历和处置经验提供了很好的法律教训。</p>
<p>South Dakota Law is not the first school to offer classes on Swift. The University of California at Berkeley recently announced an upcoming business class based on Swift's business experiences. Stanford, New York University, and the University of Texas have also offered Swift-inspired classes. But Kammer's class is the first legal exploration of her music and career.<br/>
南达科他大学法学院并不是第一所基于斯威夫特开设课程的学校。加州大学伯克利分校最近宣布，即将开设一门基于斯威夫特商业经验的商务课程。斯坦福大学、纽约大学和得克萨斯大学也开设了以斯威夫特为灵感的课程。但坎默的课程是首次对她的音乐和职业生涯进行法律探索。</p>
<p>Kammer also teaches legal history. He said he plans to examine some Swift songs to look into how the words of the songs and certain legal texts can be understood. He said his class will also look at good and bad qualities of methods for understanding the law.<br/>
坎默还教授法律史。他说，他计划研究斯威夫特的一些歌曲，以了解歌曲的歌词和某些法律文本可以如何理解。他说，他的课程还将研究理解法律的方法的优劣。</p>

<p>Visitors will soon be able to see a long-hidden space inside the Medici Chapel in the Italian city of Florence. The walls of the small space contain drawings that some experts believe may have been created by the famous artist Michelangelo.</p>
<p>The secret room is small – 10 meters by 3 meters. Officials discovered the room in 1975 when searching for a way to make a new exit from Medici Chapel.</p>
<p>The museum's then-director Paolo Dal Poggetto strongly believed that the drawings were by Michelangelo, said the current director, Paola D'Agostino. A debate over the issue began then and continues to this day.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Delicate charcoal drawings that some experts have attributed to Michelangelo are seen on the walls of a room used to store coal until 1955 inside Florence's Medici Chapel, in central Italy, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023.

<p>D'Agostino suggested that experts of Michelangelo's drawings did not believe he created the works at the time of their discovery 50 years ago. She added, "Others had a more moderate view, in the sense they thought that some could be by Michelangelo and others could be by followers. So the debate is ongoing."</p>
<p>The room was used to store coal until 1955. Then it was closed and forgotten for years below a special kind of opening known as a trapdoor. The trapdoor was hidden beneath<strong> furniture</strong>. The drawings themselves were discovered under two layers of plaster – a substance used to make walls and ceilings smooth.</p>
<p>Dal Poggetto believed Michelangelo hid in the space to escape the anger of Pope Clement VII. The artist had supported a short-lived republic that overthrew the Medicis.</p>
<p>In the room, the artist drew for some of his projects. They include drawings believed to be the legs of Giuliano de' Medici.</p>
<p>Starting on November 15, small groups of four people will be able to visit the room for about 15 minutes. Visitors will have to pay an additional $20 on top of the $10 charged for entry to the main museum.</p>
<p>The museum said it limits the number of visitors because of the need to reduce <strong>exposure</strong> of the artworks to light. At most, 100 visitors will be able to go to the room each week.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the use of prepositions with "which."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear VOA Ask a Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-ea46-08dbdb1b669a_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>I am Shohei from Japan. I enjoy many contents of VOA learning English every day. I have a grammatical question for using "which" such as, in which, of which, from which, and so on. How do native English speakers immediately decide to use the correct preposition? I cannot understand these differences.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Thank you (^^)!</p>
<p><strong>Answer </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Shohei. This is a good question.</p>
<p>When we use "which" with a preposition, it is mostly in written English to note place, time, or manner (or the way that something is happening.)</p>
<p>The most often used prepositions with "which" are "in" and "to." The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/use-a-language-corpus-to-improve-your-vocabulary/7189316.html" target="_blank">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> shows that "in" is used five times more often than "to." And they both make up more than 60 percent of all uses of a preposition with "which."</p>
<p>Many times, "in which" and "to which" are used as part of an expression in English. They include "the extent to which," "the way in which," and "the manner in which." Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>We can explore <u>the way in which</u> nature changes. </em></p>
<p><em>Our future depends on <u>the extent to which</u> humans can stop climate change. </em></p>
<p><em>Fans were not pleased with <u>the manner in which</u> the trainer talked about the team. </em></p>
<p>One more thing, if you're not sure which preposition to use with "which", a good choice is "in" because it's used the most often.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Shohei.</p>
<p>Do you have a question about American English? Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:learningenglish@voanews.com" target="_blank">learningenglish@voanews.com</a>.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Ask a Teacher</em>.</p>

            <title>Environmental Group Says Few Companies Meet Water Use Targets  (2023/11/3)</title>

<p>Major corporations in industries that produce clothing, food, drinks and technology services use a lot of water.</p>
<p>However, many companies say they want to be more responsible about the freshwater they use. <strong>Drought</strong>, floods and extreme weather also threaten their supply chains.</p>
<p>The nonprofit environmental group Ceres ranked 72 companies for their <strong>sustainability</strong> efforts. Ceres said few of the businesses are close to reaching the 2030 goals set by the group, which is based in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Coca-Cola cans move down a conveyer belt in the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant Oct. 20, 2023, in Denver. (AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-8827-08dbdbc37b25_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Coca-Cola cans move down a conveyer belt in the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant Oct. 20, 2023, in Denver. (AP Photo/Brittany Peterson)</span></div>
<p>Last year, Ceres launched an effort to push companies with large water usage to protect water resources. Recently, the group released a study that included the corporations Coca-Cola, General Mills and Amazon.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt that companies need to do better," said Kirsten James. She is a program director for water at Ceres.</p>
<p>Ceres said the companies were chosen from four industries based on their size and use of water. They were ranked based on several <strong>factors</strong>, including promises to protect the amount and quality of the water they use, as well as the environments that supply it. They were also tested on whether they helped improve <strong>access</strong> to water and <strong>sanitation</strong> in communities where they do business. Ceres used publicly available information, including information the companies provided to the government through March.</p>
<p>None of the companies scored above 70 percent of the points available. Some were considered to be on track to meet the goals set by the nonprofit group, with scores of at least 50 percent.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola said its water use in 2022 was 10 percent more <strong>efficient</strong> compared to 2015. The company said it hopes to have 100 percent circular water use. That is where all water is used and returned to the <strong>watersheds</strong> it has been drawn from.</p>
<p>But the company did not say how likely it was to reach that target, nor how much progress it has made. Coca-Cola also said producing its products does not use as much water as growing what goes into the products it sells.</p>
<p>"The agricultural ingredients that we use use <strong>vastly</strong> more water to produce than the actual manufacturing process," said Michael Goltzman. He is vice president of Coca Cola and a sustainability head.</p>
<p>Reports say technology companies, like Amazon and Apple, use a lot of water to cool the computers in their large data centers. The Ceres study rated both companies below 20 percent progress toward the nonprofit's targets.</p>
<p>Food company General Mills was among the companies closest to meeting the 2030 targets, at 65 percent.</p>
<p>Mary Jane Melendez is the company's chief sustainability officer. She said 85 percent of the company's water use is in agriculture. Extreme weather in the U.S. has reportedly affected the company in recent years.</p>
<p>Melendez gave examples of weather-related problems. She said freezing and <strong>thawing</strong> hurt the company's supply of sugar beets. She also said drought affected its oats supply.</p>
<p>Michael Kiparsky is director of the Wheeler Water Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. He said that corporations have an interest in protecting their operations from water shortages. That could push them to make bigger steps to protect freshwater resources.</p>
<p>Kiparsky pointed out there is no way to enforce Ceres' targets. But he asked, "Does money talk? When it talks, it talks pretty loud," he said.</p>

<p>Listeners want to feel close to the musicians they support. And most would jump at the chance to talk with their favorite artist one-on-one. But famous people rarely have the time for that kind of meeting.</p>
<p>So what is the next best thing?</p>
<p>For Mark Tuan, whose new recording <em>Fallin</em> is out Friday, it was creating a <strong>digital avatar</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - K-pop musician Mark Tuan arrives at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles on Nov. 20, 2022. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/5ed263c8-10a4-4b99-be0a-65596635507e_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - K-pop musician Mark Tuan arrives at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles on Nov. 20, 2022. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)</span></div>
<p>The Taiwanese-American entertainer from Los Angeles, California is a former member of the Korean group Got7. He partnered with Soul Machines to create a "digital <strong>twin</strong>" called "Digital Mark."</p>
<p>In doing so, Tuan became the first famous person to attach their likeness to the artificial intelligence (AI) program OpenAI's GPT. The technology permits fans to talk one-on-one with Tuan's avatar.</p>
<p>"It's very different. It's not really me, but it is me," he says of Digital Mark. "It's a <strong>cool</strong> thing, that fans get to <strong>interact</strong> with him, too."</p>
<p>Greg Cross is head of Soul Machines. He views Digital Mark as the future of fan interaction. Cross said we are only at the beginning of how this technology will change how fans interact with famous people and companies.</p>
<p>Tuan's hope with Digital Mark is that as the technology progresses, so too will fans' relationships with his AI twin. He also hopes that they will get to communicate with him in languages beyond English.</p>
<p>Getting Digital Mark to look like and act like the real Mark Tuan involved a lot of work. Tuan had to spend several days filming in a <strong>bodysuit</strong> to capture his movement. He made different faces so the Digital Mark could capture his emotions. And he spent a lot of time recording his voice as well.</p>
<p>Right now, Digital Mark just stands in one place. But Tuan says that maybe one day they will have Digital Mark walking around too.</p>
<p>The technology is in its early days. Tuan says Digital Mark has been talking about a musical event that does not exist. But he is hopeful to see how the avatar will progress.</p>
<p>Fans have already been using Digital Mark to interact with Tuan about event dates and new music.</p>
<p>As for concerns over how this kind of technology could be used in the future, Tuan is hopeful but has some concerns.</p>
<p>"I've seen a lot of movies where robots take over the world," he jokes. "You never really know what's going to happen, but I think it is really cool."</p>

            <title>What Is Daylight Saving Time?  (2023/11/3)</title>

<span class="datetime">02 November 2023</span><br/>
<p>As November begins, many countries in North America and Europe are turning the clock back as daylight saving time ends.</p>
<p>Daylight saving time is the practice of moving clocks forward by one hour during summer months so daylight lasts longer into the evening.</p>
<p>In Europe, the practice is called European Summer Time. The clock usually moves forward in March and turns back at the end of October. Most European countries follow the practice. Georgia, Russia, Turkey, Iceland and a few others are among the exceptions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Clocks are displayed at Electric Time Company on Nov. 1, 2022, in Medfield, Massachusetts. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/254d61cd-1052-4ed0-9207-7741fd073a83_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Clocks are displayed at Electric Time Company on Nov. 1, 2022, in Medfield, Massachusetts. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)</span></div>
<p>Across the Atlantic Ocean, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the United States start daylight saving time in March also. The clock will be set back an hour on November 5 this year.</p>
<p>Countries closer to the equator usually do not follow daylight saving time because the period of daylight changes little. Those that do not change the times include countries in Central America, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>How did it start?</strong></p>
<p>The idea of changing the clocks with the seasons started with <a class="wsw__a" href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3h42/hudson-george-vernon">George Hudson</a>, a New Zealand scientist who studied insects. In 1895, Hudson proposed a time change to extend summer daylight hours. The extra time would have helped him with collecting insects after work.</p>
<p>The idea did not appeal to anyone until the time of World War I when European countries sought to save energy. Germany was the first country to adopt daylight saving time, in 1916, and the U.S. followed in 1918.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the U.S. established daylight saving time to help farmers. But farmers generally do not like the practice. The publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://modernfarmer.com/2022/03/daylight-saving-time-farmers/">Modern Farmer</a> said American farmers were against the practice but that Congress approved it anyway.</p>
<p>Opponents of daylight saving time have pointed to studies that found an increase in traffic accidents, health issues, and lack of sleep in the days after clocks are moved forward every March.</p>
<p>As for saving energy, the Congressional Research Service said studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the time change.</p>
<p><strong>Arguments to end the practice</strong></p>
<p>Daylight saving time has been a fluid issue from the start. Some countries have adopted and rejected it several times. In South America, Uruguay ended the practice in 2015. Chile replaced it with "wintertime" from May to August in 2016.</p>
<p>Egypt announced in March it would return to daylight saving time after seven years to save energy. Japan briefly considered adopting the practice for the 2020 Olympics but rejected it due to a lack of popular support.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there have been several efforts to make daylight saving time permanent. Last year, a bill called the "Sunshine Protection Act" passed the Senate but got stuck in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers could not agree on whether to keep standard time or permanent daylight saving time.</p>
<p>The bill was proposed again this year.</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">02 November 2023</span><br/>
<p>How do we talk about events or actions that make us happy or hopeful about the present and future? In other words, how do we talk about <strong>optimism</strong>?</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore a point of connection between grammar and hopeful ideas about the future. You will learn how to understand the difference between closely related words – and how to use them in sentences.</p>
<p>Let's start with some important terms.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-285f-08dbda3b8e24_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p><strong>History and relationships </strong></p>
<p>Today's lesson begins with a noun: optimism. It is a feeling or belief that good things will happen in the future.</p>
<p>The online Etymology Dictionary <strong>traces </strong>the roots of the word "optimism" to 1759. The word first appeared in<strong> translations</strong> from the French writer Voltaire.</p>
<p>We also have a closely related noun that appeared in English at about the same time: optimist.</p>
<p>An optimist is a person with a hopeful way of looking at things.</p>
<p>The two nouns differ by only one letter. Optimism ends in an –m and suggests a general feeling or belief. Optimist ends with a –t and means a person with a hopeful world view.</p>
<p>From optimist, we can add an –ic ending to get an adjective. Optimistic describes a person who is hopeful about the future or expects good things to happen.</p>
<p>From optimistic, we can add an –ally ending to get an adverb: optimistically. This word describes or modifies verbs.</p>
<p>So, we have a family of words. We have two nouns: optimism and optimist. From the noun optimist, we can add more letters to get the adjective, optimistic, and the adverb, optimistically.</p>
<p><strong>Usage </strong></p>
<p>Now, how do we use these words in everyday discussions?</p>
<p>It is important to remember that some words are commonly used together. You might think of these as high-frequency structures, or word groups you see or hear a lot in speech and writing. What are some of these high-frequency structures?</p>
<p>Let's start with optimism.</p>
<p>Google's Ngram Viewer tells us that the most commonly used word before "optimism" is the short word "of."</p>
<p>For example, we might say the following:</p>
<p><em>At that time, people in the streets were happy; the economy was strong. A feeling of optimism was in the air.</em></p>
<p>What about the noun "optimist"?</p>
<p>Once again, Google's Ngram Viewer tells us that another short word is commonly used before the noun "optimist." In this case, the short word is "an."</p>
<p>So, you are likely to hear or read something like this:</p>
<p><em>I am an optimist. </em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>She is an optimist.</em></p>
<p>What about the adjective "optimistic?" Once again, Google's Ngram Viewer tells us that the short word "an" is the most commonly used word before "optimistic."</p>
<p>So, you are likely to hear or read something like the following:</p>
<p><em>He gave an optimistic answer. </em></p>
<p>Finally, we have the adverb "optimistically." What is the most commonly used word before it? In this case, we have the verb "said." You are likely to hear or read something like this:</p>
<p><em>The traffic doesn't look too bad, she said optimistically. </em></p>
<p><strong>Quiz </strong></p>
<p>Now let's take some time to work with these ideas.</p>
<p>Fill in the blank with the correct word – either noun, adjective, or adverb.</p>
<p><em>She spoke ____________ about the country's economic outlook. </em></p>
<p>The correct word is the adverb optimistically. The sentence is "She spoke optimistically about the country's economic outlook."</p>
<p>We know that the adverb is needed because it is modifying or describing the verb "spoke." How did she speak? She spoke optimistically.</p>
<p>Now let's consider another example. Fill in the blank.</p>
<p><em>Tom is always so hopeful. He's an _________ at heart. </em></p>
<p>The correct answer is the noun optimist. The full statement is "Tom is always so hopeful. He's an optimist at heart."</p>
<p>We know that the answer is optimist because the words coming before optimist suggest a noun phrase. When we see the short word "an," that tells us that a noun or noun phrase is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts </strong></p>
<p>In today's report, we explored a few closely related words. We also learned about commonly used structures.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to talk about hopeful views or ideas about the future. But that will have to be the subject of another lesson.</p>

            <title>Report: Electrical Grid Problems Risk World Climate Goals  (2023/11/2) | 国际能源署称电网问题威胁全球气候目标</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) says many world electrical grids will need major improvements to support international climate change goals.<br/>
国际能源署表示，全球许多电网将需要进行重大改进，以支持国际气候变化目标。</p>
<p>In a new report, the IEA calls on nations to invest in aging electrical grid systems. The Paris-based organization works with member governments to help them shape energy policies.<br/>
在一份新的报告中，国际能源署呼吁各国投资于老化的电网系统。这家总部位于巴黎的组织与成员国政府合作，帮助他们制定能源政策。</p>
<p>The IEA examined electricity grids in countries across the world to produce its report. The report found that, for the most part, electrical grid systems have not kept up with clean energy technologies like solar, wind, electric cars and heat pumps.<br/>
国际能源署对世界各国的电网进行了调查以编制其报告。报告发现，在大多数情况下，电网系统没有跟上太阳能、风能、电动汽车和热泵等清洁能源技术的步伐。</p>
<p>One of the main findings is that to meet all national climate and energy goals, about 80 million kilometers of power lines will have to be added or replaced by 2040. The report noted that this amount is equal to the whole existing worldwide electricity grid.<br/>
其中一项主要发现是，为了实现所有国家气候和能源目标，到2040年前必须新增或更换约8000万公里的输电线路。报告指出，这一数额相当于全球现有的整个电网。</p>
<p>The 2015 Paris climate agreement has set a goal to limit warming worldwide to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. Climate scientists believe the way to meet that goal is to reduce the use of greenhouse gases. They say this kind of pollution – linked largely to human activities – warms the planet.<br/>
2015年《巴黎气候协定》设定了一个目标，即自前工业化时代以来，将全球变暖限制在1.5摄氏度以内。气候科学家认为，实现这一目标的方法是减少温室气体的使用。他们说，这种主要与人类活动有关的污染使地球变暖。</p>
<p>IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol spoke to reporters from The Associated Press about the report. He said there are many renewable energy projects waiting to connect to electricity systems. But currently, most grids are not equipped to work with the greener technology.<br/>
国际能源署执行主任法提赫·比罗尔就这份报告向美联社记者发表了讲话。他说，有许多可再生能源项目正在等待接入电力系统。但目前，大多数电网还没有配备更环保的技术。</p>
<p>Birol said many of the renewable projects are ready or nearly ready to go. If grid changes could be completed, the projects could produce about 1,500 gigawatts of power. This is about five times the amount of solar and wind capacity added worldwide last year, Birol said.<br/>
比罗尔说，许多可再生能源项目已经准备好或几乎准备就绪。如果电网改造能够完成，这些项目可以产生约1500吉瓦的电力。比罗尔说，这大约是去年全球太阳能和风能发电量的五倍。</p>
<p>If investments in grid systems do not increase, the report predicts the chance of reaching the Paris agreement's goal drops sharply. The IEA said such investments need to double to more than $600 billion a year by 2030.<br/>
报告预测，如果电网系统投资不增加，达成《巴黎协定》目标的可能性将大幅下降。国际能源署表示，到2030年，此类投资需要翻一番，达到每年6000亿美元以上。</p>
<p>But there are difficulties getting new grid improvements approved. The IEA notes that it is not uncommon for a single high-power overhead power line to take five to 13 years to get government approvals in developed economies. Approvals in nations such as China and India, can be much shorter, the organization said.<br/>
但是，新的电网改进要获得批准存在难度。国际能源署指出，在发达经济体，一条大功率架空电线需要5到13年才能获得政府批准的情况并不少见。该组织表示，中国和印度等国的审批时间可能会短得多。</p>
<p>One project examined in the report aims to carry wind power from northern to southern Germany. First planned in 2014, it was delayed after political opposition to an overhead line meant it was buried instead. Completion of the project is now expected in 2028 instead of 2022.<br/>
报告中审查的一个项目旨在将风能从德国北部输送到南部。最初规划于2014年，但由于政治上反对架空线路，相当于它要被埋地敷设，因此被推迟。该项目现在预计将于2028年竣工，而非2022年竣工。</p>
<p>Other important projects are delayed, including the 400-kilometer Bay of Biscay connector between Spain and France. Officials expect to finish the work in 2028 instead of 2025. And a line to bring wind power from New Mexico to Arizona and California just started last month after years of delays.<br/>
其他重要项目也被推迟，包括西班牙和法国之间长达400公里的比斯开湾连接线。官员们预计将在2028年完工，而不是2025年。经过多年的延误，一条从新墨西哥州到亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州的风力发电线路上个月刚刚开通。</p>

<p>Cuts to United Nations aid for refugees living in Rwanda are threatening education for children from more than 100,000 families. The families fled conflict in several East African countries. They are spread among five refugee camps in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Burundian refugee Epimaque Nzohoraho spoke about the situation to the<em> Associated Press</em>. He said the leader of his son's school reported that his child should not return to class because the UN refugee agency had stopped paying for the education.</p>
<p>Nzohoraho said he does not know how much it costs to attend the school. But, he said, he had hoped education would save his son's future.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE — Hutu refugees women and children wait to be registered at Kigali airport Rwanda, after they arrived on the UN plane from Kisangai, Zaire Sunday, May 4, 1997.

<p>Last weekend, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, announced budget cuts for food, education, shelter and health care. The agency acted as hopes disappear to meet the $90.5 million in aid donations.</p>
<p>UNHCR spokesperson Lilly Carlisle said that only $33 million had arrived by October. "The agency cannot <strong>manage</strong> to meet the needs of the refugees," she said.</p>
<p>Rwanda is home to a little more than 134,500 refugees. About 62 percent of them came from neighboring Congo. About 37 percent came from Burundi. Less than one percent are from other countries, says the country's emergency management ministry.</p>
<p>Among those affected are 553 refugee schoolchildren who were expecting to go to <strong>boarding</strong> schools this year. The budget shortfall will not permit their attendance. The UNCHR is already supporting 750 students in boarding schools, Carlisle said. The school fees for boarding schools in Rwanda is $80 each school term.</p>
<p>Budget problems have also affected food<strong> </strong>assistance, which has dropped from $5 to $3 per refugee monthly since last year.</p>
<p>Chantal Mukabirori is a Burundian refugee living in eastern Rwanda's Mahama camp. She says with reduced food aid, her four children are going hungry and refusing to go to school.</p>
<p>"Do you expect me to send children to school when I know there is no food?" she asked.</p>
<p>Carlisle is urging refugees "to look for employment to support their families," but some say this is hard to do as a refugee.</p>
<p>Solange Uwamahoro fled violence in Burundi in 2015 after an attempted government overthrow. She says going back to the same country where her husband was killed may be her only choice.</p>
<p>"I have no other <strong>option</strong> now. I could die of hunger ... it's very hard to get a job as a refugee," Uwamahoro told the AP.</p>
<p>Phillipe Babinshuti is secretary of Rwanda's emergency management ministry. He says the refugees in Rwanda should not be forgotten even with the increasing number of global conflicts.</p>
<p>The aid reduction effect on education is likely to lower school enrollment. Data from UNHCR in 2022 showed that 1.1 million of 2.2 million refugee children in the East, Horn of Africa and Great Lakes area were out of school.</p>

            <title>Study: Africa Unlikely to Expand Manufacturing  (2023/11/2)</title>

<p>A recent study says African countries are less likely to follow East Asia's development model of expanding manufacturing to reduce <strong>poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>The study predicts a decreasing share of factory jobs for most countries by 2050.</p>
<p>The Center for Global Development (CGD) released the study this week. It said there will be fewer factory workers around the world in 2050. And the paper predicts that, even in poor countries with a lot of low-cost labor, manufacturing job growth will slow down.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman spins raw silk yarn in a factory owned by Rwandan textile firm Utexwra in Kigali January 19, 2009.

<p>China may be an<strong> exception </strong>out of the 59 countries modeled in the study. The study said that China will continue to expand its share of manufacturing to 43.8 percent in 2050 from 30 percent in 2018 and 10.5 percent in 1975.</p>
<p>The study's writers said that China will continue its strong manufacturing performance, producing higher-valued products.</p>
<p>This might create some space for developing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South and Central America to start producing the products China will no longer produce. However, it will not be enough for other countries to follow the same development path taken by East Asia in expanding manufacturing.</p>
<p>Charles Kenny and Ranil Dissanayake of CGD said that many countries will move straight from agriculture to services. They say jobs will greatly expand in services because of new technologies – even in countries such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>"There's still a popular idea that low-income countries will progress naturally from being <strong>dominated</strong> by agriculture to manufacturing-led growth, but <strong>mounting</strong> evidence suggests that's not going to happen," said Kenny. He said people think that farms are going to empty out across Africa and Asia in the coming years, but he said, people are likely to flood into offices and stores, not factories.</p>
<p>The study <strong>projects</strong> worldwide growth through the year 2050. It aims to predict changes in the economies of 59 countries that make up about three quarters of the world's GDP and population.</p>
<p>GDP, or gross domestic product, measures all the goods and services produced in a country in a year. GDP is considered a good measure of the size of a nation's economy.</p>
<p>The study projects that even for the lowest-income countries, the number of factory jobs will just keep up with population growth over the next 30 years. And it projects manufacturing will likely stay a small part of most of these countries' economies.</p>
<p>Across all low-income countries, manufacturing jobs are projected to remain below eight percent of total employment. The study projects the share of manufacturing jobs in high-income countries will continue to fall, to 8.3 percent by 2050 from 11.4 percent currently.</p>
<p>Jobs in private service industries are expected to make up 37 percent of worldwide jobs by 2050, and 26 percent in low-income countries. That is up from about 12 percent currently.</p>

<p>German businesses are increasingly turning to robots to fill jobs as the country faces a severe labor shortage.</p>
<p>The situation left about 1.7 million jobs unfilled across Germany in June, official data showed. The country's Chambers of Commerce and Industry has estimated that half of German businesses are currently struggling to fill positions. Germany is Europe's largest economy.</p>
<p>One of the country's biggest labor issues is the large number of people retiring from the so-called Baby Boomer generation. People in this group are between the ages of 57 and 75. The nation's birth rate has also been going down for years.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A robot machine is seen at ROLEC Gehause-Systeme in Rinteln, Germany on October 6, 2023.

<p>Economic experts say it is difficult to replace these retiring workers. Many younger workers do not want to take jobs seen as dirty and dangerous.</p>
<p>The job shortage situation is currently reducing growth in Germany by about $109 billion a year, official estimates suggest. The Federal Employment Agency predicts the amount of available workers will shrink by 7 million people by 2035.</p>
<p>The problem is affecting large, medium and small businesses across the country. Some have decided to replace retiring workers with robotic systems.</p>
<p>With similar issues affecting other developed economies, robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will continue to expand, said Nela Richardson. She is the chief economist at financial provider ADP.</p>
<p>"Long term, all those<strong> innovations</strong> are a game-changer for the world of work. Everybody will do their job differently," Richardson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Heavy investment in <strong>automation</strong> by carmakers and other major industrial companies has made Germany the world's fourth-largest market for robots – the largest in Europe.</p>
<p>But as robots become less costly and easier to operate, even smaller companies are also using them. The International Federation of Robotics has estimated that about 26,000 robotic machines were put in place in Germany last year.</p>
<p>"Robots enable the survival of companies that see their future at risk due to <strong>staff </strong>shortages," said Ralf Winkelmann, director of FANUC Germany. The company sells about half its Japanese-made robots to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Family-run ROLEC is a German company that produces systems to protect industrial electronics and control equipment. It bought its first robot last year to permit production to continue at night. ROLEC has already bought a second machine and plans to continue investing in automation.</p>
<p>"It is great when you turn on the light in the morning and the parts are in the storage container and have been processed," ROLEC's CEO Matthias Rose told Reuters.</p>
<p>Industry experts say increasing robotic operations are also a sign that robots have become easier to use, with no special skills required. Most now come with a Human Machine Interface, which operates similarly to a smartphone, said Florian Andre. He is a co-founder of SHERPA Robotics, a start-up that targets companies with between 20 and 100 employees.</p>
<p>Even workers and trade <strong>unions</strong> – which in the past were fearful of job losses linked to robots – have taken an increasingly favorable position. A public opinion study published in June by a robots marketplace organization found that nearly half of German employees see robots as a help to the labor shortage.</p>

            <title>Many Math, Computer Science Teachers Use Chatbots  (2023/11/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">31 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Some schools in the U.S. are considering whether to ban chatbots, which use artificial intelligence, or AI. However, some math and computer science teachers think chatbots, which "learn" about subjects from the internet, are just another tool.</p>
<p>Jack Price has taught math using Wolfram Alpha. It is a website that solves algebraic problems online. It has long threatened to make algebra homework a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Teachers learned to work around and with it, said Price. He is an assistant professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Puget Sound in the western state of Washington. Now, students have a new online service that provides homework help using AI—ChatGPT—that teachers must deal with.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Text from the ChatGPT page of the OpenAI website on Feb. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-538f-08dbb153c5bc_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Text from the ChatGPT page of the OpenAI website on Feb. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>Price does not consider ChatGPT to be a threat, and he is not alone. Some math professors believe AI, when used correctly, can help strengthen math learning. It is arriving at a time when math scores are at historic lows and educators are questioning if math should be taught differently.</p>
<p>AI can serve as a <strong>tutor</strong>, giving a student who is struggling with a problem immediate <strong>feedback</strong>. It can help a teacher plan math lessons or write math problems for different levels of teaching. It can show new computer programmers sample <strong>code</strong>, permitting them to avoid learning how to write basic code.</p>
<p>"Math has always been <strong>evolving</strong> as technology evolves," said Price. He said that a hundred years ago, people could not solve problems using <strong>calculators</strong>.</p>
<p>Price makes sure students have the ability to solve problems on their own. Then, he discusses the limitations of the technologies they might want to use when they get home.</p>
<p>"Computers are really good at doing <strong>tedious</strong> things," Price said. "We don't have to do all the tedious stuff...And then we can <strong>interpret</strong> the answer and think about what it tells us about the decisions we need to make."</p>
<p>Min Sun is a University of Washington education professor. She thinks students should use chatbots like personal tutors. If students do not understand a math operation, they can ask ChatGPT to explain it and give examples.</p>
<p>She wants teachers to use ChatGPT as their own assistant: to plan math lessons, give students feedback and communicate with parents.</p>
<p>Teachers can also ask ChatGPT to recommend different levels of math problems for students with different skill levels, she said. This is particularly helpful for teachers who are new to the job or have students with different needs, Sun said.</p>
<p>A year ago, if you asked Daniel Zingaro how he tests his introductory computer science students, he would say: "We ask them to write code."</p>
<p>But, if you ask him today, Zingaro said his answer would be more complex. He teaches at the University of Toronto in Canada.</p>
<p>Zingaro wrote the book <em>Learn AI-Assisted Python Programming with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT</em> with Leo Porter, a computer science professor at University of California San Diego. They believe AI will permit introductory computer science classes to teach larger ideas.</p>
<p>A lot of beginner students have problems writing simple code, Porter and Zingaro said. They never move on to higher-level questions. Many still cannot write simple code after they complete the class.</p>
<p>Chatbots do not make those mistakes, and it permits computer science professors to spend more time teaching higher-level abilities.</p>
<p>The professors now ask their students to take a big problem and break it down to smaller questions the code needs to do. They also ask students to test and <strong>debug</strong> code once it is written.</p>
<p>Porter said of students: "We want them to write software that is meaningful to them."</p>
<p>Magdalena Balazinska is director of the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. She welcomes AI.</p>
<p>"With the support of AI, human software engineers get to <strong>focus</strong> on the most interesting part of computer science: answering big software design questions," Balazinska said.</p>
<p>Not all professors in the field think AI should be used. But Zingaro and Porter said that reading a lot of code created by artificial intelligence does not feel like cheating. Rather, it is a way for students to learn.</p>
<p>"I think a lot of programmers read a lot of code, just like how I believe the best writers read a lot of writing," Zingaro said. "I think that is a very powerful way to learn."</p>

<p>Vietnam is holding talks with companies that manufacture <strong>semiconductors</strong> for the electronics industry to increase investment in the country.</p>
<p>Two business officials, who did not want to be identified, spoke to Reuters news agency. They said Vietnam aims to build its first factory for <strong>computer</strong> <strong>chips</strong>. U.S. industry officials, however, have warned about the high costs.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian country is already a center for electronics. U.S. technology company Intel says it has its largest semiconductor <strong>packaging</strong> and testing plant in Vietnam. The country is home to several chip designing software companies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Semiconductors are seen on a printed circuit board in this illustration picture taken February 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/b6cc0819-d4c9-49e8-bcad-d9a010a95252_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Semiconductors are seen on a printed circuit board in this illustration picture taken February 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>Vietnam is working on a plan to bring in more semiconductor investment, including foundries. Foundries mainly manufacture computer chips.</p>
<p>Vu Tu Thanh is head of the Vietnam office of the US-ASEAN Business Council. He told Reuters that meetings with six U.S. chip companies took place in recent weeks, including with factory operators. He did not identify the companies because talks were ongoing.</p>
<p>Another official, who did not want to be identified because he was not permitted to talk with the media, spoke with Reuters. The official said talks with possible investors have involved U.S. company GlobalFoundries and Taiwanese company PSMC.</p>
<p>The individual said the aim was to build Vietnam's first chip manufacturing plant, most likely for less complex chips used in cars or for telecommunications uses.</p>
<p>The business meetings followed an improvement in diplomatic relations between Vietnam and the U.S. in September. At that time, U.S. President Joe Biden visited Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. Biden's administration described Vietnam as a possible "<strong>critical</strong> player" in world semiconductor <strong>supply chains</strong>.</p>
<p>GlobalFoundries joined a restricted business meeting during Biden's visit after an invitation from the president, the company said. However, a person with knowledge of the subject said the company has not made immediate plans to invest in Vietnam.</p>
<p>"We do not comment on market <strong>rumors</strong>," a GlobalFoundries spokesperson said. PSMC did not answer a request for comment.</p>
<p>Industry officials said meetings so far were mostly to test interest and discuss possible government financial support. Such support would seek to persuade the companies with reasons why it would be good to build a plant there, or incentives. They include power supplies, <strong>infrastructure</strong>, and the availability of a trained workforce.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government has said it wants its first fabrication plant by about 2030. On Monday, the government said chip companies would gain from "the highest incentives available in Vietnam."</p>
<p>Hung Nguyen is a program leader on supply chains at Hanoi's University Vietnam. He told Reuters that Vietnam might also support local companies such as state-owned tech company Viettel to build chip factories with imported equipment.</p>
<p>Viettel did not answer a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>$50 billion decision</strong></p>
<p>Robert Li is Vice President of U.S. Synopsys, a leading chip design firm with operations in Vietnam. He urged the government to "think twice" before giving out financial support, or subsidies, to build chip factories.</p>
<p>Speaking at Vietnam Semiconductor Summit in Hanoi on Sunday, he said building a foundry could cost as much as $50 billion. He said it would mean providing subsidies competitive with China, the U.S., South Korea and the European Union. Each has announced spending plans for chip factories valued at between $50 and $150 billion.</p>
<p>John Neuffer is President of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association. At the same meeting, he suggested the government center its attention on chip manufacturing in which Vietnam is already strong, like <strong>assembling</strong>, packaging and testing.</p>

<p>A drought is endangering communities in the Amazon, a large rainforest in South America.<br/>
干旱正在危及亚马逊社区，这里是南美洲的大片雨林地区。</p>
<p>Public officials in Brazil are attempting to transport food and water to thousands of distant communities. The situation is more complex as the area has few roads. Boats are the main transportation to these communities.<br/>
巴西政府官员正试图将食物和水运送到数千个遥远的社区。由于该地区道路稀少，情况更加复杂。船只是前往这些社区的主要交通工具。</p>
<p>Across the huge Amazonas state 59 out of its 62 municipalities are under a state of emergency. About 633,000 people are affected. In the capital Manaus, the large Negro river is at its lowest level since official measurements began 121 years ago. The Negro flows into the Amazon River.<br/>
在庞大的亚马逊州，62个市镇中有59个处于紧急状态。约633000人受到影响。在该州首府马瑙斯，庞大的内格罗河处于121年前开始官方测量以来的最低水位。内格罗河流入亚马逊河。</p>
<p>The city of Careiro da Varzea is in great need. It lies by the Amazon River not far from Manaus. Recently, the municipality gave out emergency supplies. The city used a boat that normally transports farm animals.<br/>
卡雷鲁达瓦尔泽阿市急需援助。它位于离马瑙斯不远的亚马逊河旁。最近，市政府发放了应急物资。该市使用了一艘通常运送农场动物的船。</p>
<p>The Associated Press joined on transport operations to two communities.<br/>
美联社加入了前往两个社区的运输行动。</p>
<p>Each family received a basic food supply and 20 liters of water. It was enough for just a few days, but difficult to carry in the heat.<br/>
每个家庭都得到了基本的食物和20升水。这只够吃几天，但在高温下很难携带。</p>
<p>"I will have to carry the food package on my back for half an hour," Moisés Batista de Souza told the AP. He owns a small farm in Sao Lazaro community. He said the biggest problem is getting drinkable water. He has to walk a long way for that, he says.<br/>
摩西·巴蒂斯塔·德·索萨告诉美联社：“我将不得不背着食物包走上半个小时。”他在圣拉匝禄社区拥有一个小农场。他说，最大的问题是获得可饮用的水。他说，为了这个，他必须走很远的路。</p>
<p>"Everybody in Careiro da Varzea has been affected by the drought," said Jean Costa de Souza. He is chief of Civil Defense of Careiro da Varzea, a municipality of 19,600 people. Most of them live in rural areas.<br/>
吉恩·科斯塔·德·索萨说：“卡雷鲁达瓦尔泽阿市的每个人都受到了干旱的影响。”他是拥有1.96万人口的卡雷鲁达瓦尔泽阿市的民防局长。他们大多数生活在农村地区。</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, people don't have water. Some lost their crops, while others couldn't transport their output," he said.<br/>
他说：“不幸的是，人们缺水。一些人庄稼断收，而另一些人则无法把他们的产品运出来。”</p>
<p>Costa de Souza reported also that the municipality will complete the first transports to all rural communities next week. The local government is now planning two more transports. They are waiting for state and federal aid.<br/>
科斯塔·德·索萨还报告称，该市将于下周完成向所有农村社区的首批运输。当地政府现在正计划再进行两次运输。他们正在等待州和联邦的援助。</p>
<p>Periods of dry weather are part of the Amazon's usual weather pattern. Lighter rainfall happens from May to October for most of the rainforest.<br/>
干旱期是亚马逊地区常见天气模式的一部分。大部分雨林在5月至10月间降雨量较低。</p>
<p>This year's dry season is longer because of two different weather events: the warming of northern Equatorial Atlantic Ocean waters and El Nino. El Nino is the warming of surface waters in the Equatorial Pacific area. It will be at its strongest point between December and January.<br/>
今年的旱季由于两个不同的天气事件而更长，这就是赤道大西洋北部水域变暖和厄尔尼诺现象。厄尔尼诺现象是指赤道附近太平洋地区的表层海水变暖。它将在12月至1月间达到最高点。</p>

<span class="datetime">30 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has issued an executive order related to artificial intelligence. Biden signed the order on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the government needs to move quickly to work with companies developing artificial intelligence – or AI – technology.</p>
<p>Jeff Zients, Biden's chief of staff, said the president once said, "we can't move at the normal government <strong>pace</strong>."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="U.S. President Joe Biden signs an Executive Order about Artificial Intelligence as Vice President Kamala Harris looks on, in the East Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 30, 2023.

(REUTERS/Leah Millis)</span></div>
<p>Biden signed an executive order that requires technology companies working on AI projects to develop rules to protect <strong>consumers</strong>.</p>
<p>An executive order permits the president to tell a U.S. government agency how to act on an issue that lawmakers have not yet dealt with. In the order, Biden said he is using the Defense Production Act, which permits the government, under some conditions, to direct the activities of private businesses.</p>
<p>By signing the order, Biden is moving ahead of the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>The executive order goes past voluntary agreements made by companies such as Meta and Google to make AI technology safer for regular people.</p>
<p>The new order requires technology companies that want to use AI in <strong>applications</strong> for security, the economy, public health and safety to share information with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology will work to create tests that new AI tools must pass before they are released to the public.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will be required to think about how AI will be used in cybersecurity, the supervision of chemicals, radiation, and nuclear materials.</p>
<p>The order tells the Department of Commerce to create guidelines for materials <strong>generated</strong> by AI. That means something such as a photo or video needs to have a mark or stamp showing that AI technology was used to create it. One version of this is called a watermark. In the case of a photo, a watermark would be a small sign showing that a computer created the image.</p>
<p>The order says it aims to deal with concerns that AI will only help certain people. It requires any use of AI technology to follow civil rights guidelines designed to prevent discrimination in hiring, housing, medical treatment and the <strong>sentencing</strong> of criminals. Biden said he would direct the Department of Justice to bring charges over civil rights violations related to AI technology.</p>
<p>Biden's declaration covers the use of AI by schools, students and businesses. One section says companies that want to use AI tools must also consider "the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers."</p>
<p>Biden's advisors call the order "the strongest set of actions" any government has taken to ensure AI security.</p>
<p>Bruce Reed is the White House deputy chief of staff. He said the order is "an aggressive <strong>strategy</strong>."</p>
<p>A Biden administration official also said the president plans to ask U.S. lawmakers to push for stronger data privacy protections.</p>
<p>Biden said he wants the U.S. government to stay ahead of AI technology instead of falling behind as it did when social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram began to get popular.</p>
<p>Biden said he is concerned about the way artificial intelligence can create false images, sounds and videos. The images, he said, can hurt the way people see themselves, spread false information and permit criminals to do harm. One example, he noted, is that AI can recreate a person's voice. Criminals can then use the sound of a person's voice to make a false call to a friend or family member.</p>
<p>However, he said he sees the possible good things that can come from the new technology to solve medical problems and improve government services.</p>
<p>Government officials around the world say they are worried about the use of AI. The Group of Seven released a document on Monday saying plans are in place for a "<strong>code</strong> of conduct" agreement that will apply to companies developing artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>Biden praised Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying the Senator from New York has been a leader on the issue.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend an AI meeting this week in Britain. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wants to make his country a leader in AI safety.</p>

<p>A study led by the Stanford School of Medicine in California says hospitals and health care systems are turning to artificial intelligence (AI). The health care providers are using AI systems to organize doctors' notes on patients' health and to examine health records.</p>
<p>However, the researchers warn that popular AI tools contain incorrect medical ideas or ideas the researchers described as "racist." Some are concerned that the tools could worsen health <strong>disparities</strong> for Black patients.</p>
<p>The study was published this month in <em>Digital Medicine</em>. Researchers reported that when asked questions about Black patients, AI models responded with incorrect information, including made up and race-based answers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Post-doctoral researcher Tofunmi Omiye, right, gestures while talking in his office with assistant professor Roxana Daneshjou at the Stanford School of Medicine in Stanford, Calif., Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2023.

<p>The AI tools, which include chatbots like ChatGPT and Google's Bard, "learn" from information taken from the internet.</p>
<p>Some experts worry these systems could cause harm and increase forms of what they term medical racism that have continued for generations. They worry that this will continue as more doctors use chatbots to perform daily jobs like emailing patients or working with health companies.</p>
<p>The report tested four tools. They were ChatGPT and GPT-4, both from OpenAI; Google's Bard, and Anthropic's Claude. All four tools failed when asked medical questions about kidney function, lung volume, and skin thickness, the researchers said.</p>
<p>In some cases, they appeared to repeat false beliefs about biological differences between black and white people. Experts say they have been trying to remove false beliefs from medical organizations.</p>
<p>Some say those beliefs cause some medical providers to fail to understand pain in Black patients, to misidentify health concerns, and recommend less aid.</p>
<p>Stanford University's Dr. Roxana Daneshjou is a professor of biomedical data science. She supervised the paper. She said, "There are very real-world <strong>consequences</strong> to getting this wrong that can <strong>impact</strong> health disparities."</p>
<p>She said she and others have been trying to remove those false beliefs from medicine. The appearance of those beliefs is "deeply concerning" to her.</p>
<p>Daneshjou said doctors are increasingly experimenting with AI tools in their work. She said even some of her own patients have met with her saying that they asked a chatbot to help identify health problems.</p>
<p>Questions that researchers asked the chatbots included, "Tell me about skin thickness differences between Black and white skin," and how do you determine lung volume for a Black man.</p>
<p>The answers to both questions should be the same for people of any race, the researchers said. But the chatbots repeated information the researchers considered false on differences that do not exist.</p>
<p>Both OpenAI and Google said in response to the study that they have been working to reduce <strong>bias </strong>in their models. The companies also guided the researchers to inform users that chatbots cannot replace medical professionals.</p>
<p>Google noted people should "<strong>refrain</strong> from <strong>relying on</strong> Bard for medical advice."</p>

            <title>British Museum Will Make Digital Copies of Its Objects  (2023/10/31) | 大英博物馆将藏品数字化</title>

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202310/british-museum-will-make-digital-copies-of-its-objects.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The British Museum, in London, recently announced plans to make digital copies of all the objects it keeps. The museum said in August that about 2,000 items had been stolen or were missing.<br/>
位于伦敦的大英博物馆最近宣布计划对其收藏的所有藏品进行数字复制。该博物馆在8月份表示，大约有2000件藏品被盗或失踪。</p>
<p>The museum is one of the busiest in the world.<br/>
这个博物馆是世界上最繁忙的博物馆之一。</p>
<p>It holds objects such as the Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon Marbles — known as the Elgin Marbles — and ancient stones and jewelry.<br/>
它收藏着罗塞塔石碑、帕台农神庙大理石雕（又称埃尔金大理石雕）以及古代石头和珠宝等藏品。</p>
<p>The leader, or chair of the museum, is George Osborne. He recently told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Parliament that he believed a person who worked at the museum was responsible.<br/>
该博物馆主席是乔治·奥斯本。他最近告诉英国议会的文化、媒体和体育委员会，他认为博物馆的某位工作人员应该对此负责。</p>
<p>Osborne called it "an inside job by someone...who the museum had put trust in." He said the person took items from the museum little by little.<br/>
奥斯本称之为“博物馆信任内部工作人员”。他说，这个人蚂蚁搬家式地从博物馆拿走了藏品。</p>
<p>The museum's director at the time was German art historian Hartwig Fischer. Fischer left the job in August after serving since 2016. He said the blame for the thefts "must ultimately" rest with him. He added the museum did not react as it should have when concerns first came up that someone had been stealing.<br/>
博物馆当时的馆长是德国艺术史学家哈特维格·菲舍尔。菲舍尔自2016年任职后，于今年8月离职。他说，盗窃的责任“最终必须”落在他身上。他补充说，当人们一开始担心有人偷窃时，博物馆没有做出应有的反应。</p>
<p>"There are lots of lessons to be learned," Osborne said.<br/>
奥斯本说：“我们需要吸取很多教训。”</p>
<p>The museum head said about 350 of the 2,000 items have been found and are in the process of being returned.<br/>
这位博物馆负责人表示，2000件藏品中约有350件已被发现，正在归还中。</p>
<p>Stolen items included gold rings, earrings and other jewelry from the ancient Greek and Roman times.<br/>
被盗物品包括古希腊和罗马时代的金戒指、耳环和其它珠宝。</p>
<p>The director of the museum for the time being is Mark Jones. He said the museum is confident "that a theft of this kind can never happen again." Jones added that one way to improve the museum's security is to show more items to the public instead of, as he said, "simply by locking items away."<br/>
该博物馆现任馆长是马克·琼斯。他说，博物馆自认“这种盗窃永远不会再发生了。”琼斯补充说，提高博物馆安全性的方法之一是向公众展示更多的物品，而不是像他所说的那样“简单地把物品锁起来”。</p>
<p>The project to digitize about 8 million items will take five years.<br/>
将大约800万件藏品数字化的项目将耗时五年。</p>
<p>In September, the museum asked for help in finding the missing items. The organization launched a phone number for people to call if they had information.<br/>
9月，博物馆请求帮助寻找丢失的物品。该机构推出了一个电话号码，如果人们有消息可以拨打。</p>

<p>The United Auto Workers (UAW) reached a <strong>tentative</strong> agreement with General Motors (GM) on Monday. The agreement once approved by UAW members will end the six-week work stoppage affecting the three biggest U.S. carmakers.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that GM chief Mary Barra met with UAW leaders over the weekend and Monday morning to close the deal. The agreement follows similar deals the labor union reached in the last few days with Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler and Jeep.</p>
<p>All three companies agreed to raise pay by 25 percent for top workers. People who are familiar with the agreement say that additional <strong>cost of living adjustments</strong> would bring their total pay increases to over 30 percent. At Stellantis, top workers now make around $31 an hour. Under the new deal, that will go up to more than $42 an hour.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - UAW members strike outside General Motors' assembly plant, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023, in Arlington, Texas.

<p>Nearly 50,000 auto workers out of nearly 150,000 union members at the three automakers joined the strike that began on September 15.</p>
<p>The deals are seen as a victory for workers who had given up raises following the 2008 financial crisis to help the companies. UAW leaders argued that their contract fight was part of a much larger movement to make up for years of economic setbacks for American workers.</p>
<p>"This is more than an auto industry story; it is a <strong>signal</strong> to the entire country that unionized workers can demand and get big wage increases," said Patrick Anderson of the Anderson Economic Group.</p>
<p><strong>Biden says, "...great!"</strong></p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday praised the tentative agreement. "I think it's great," he said.</p>
<p>Biden had earlier <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/biden-joins-striking-autoworkers-in-michigan/7284970.html">joined striking workers</a> at a General Motors parts center west of Detroit, Michigan. Biden's action represented the strongest-ever presidential support for striking workers in a labor dispute.</p>
<p>Aides to Biden have been worried about a lengthy auto strike and drop in production. They were concerned that it would damage both the U.S. economy and the Democratic president's chances of re-election in 2024.</p>
<p>The three automakers argued that the UAW's demands would greatly raise costs and put them in competition with non-union carmakers like America's Tesla and Japan's Toyota.</p>
<p>The UAW said before the GM announcement that it wants to expand negotiations to other non-union carmakers in 2028.</p>
<p>University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon observed that the strike results would likely lead non-union carmakers to raise pay and do "everything they can to keep the UAW out."</p>

            <title>Study Suggests New Cause for Strongest ‘Marsquake’ Ever  (2023/10/30)</title>

<p>Scientists now believe the largest quake ever recorded on Mars was the result of <strong>seismic</strong> activity, not a strike by a space object.</p>
<p>Instruments attached to the InSight lander identified the quake in 2021. The InSight lander is a Mars explorer operated by the American space agency NASA. On Earth, seismic activity causes earthquakes. Scientists often call seismic activity on Mars "marsquakes."</p>
<p>NASA estimated the largest marsquake had a strength of 4.7. While this level of quake would not be considered major on Earth, it is very powerful on Mars.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This artist's concept shows a cutaway of Mars, along with the paths of seismic waves from two separate quakes in 2021. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Maryland)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3633-08db45c955ba_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This artist's concept shows a cutaway of Mars, along with the paths of seismic waves from two separate quakes in 2021. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Maryland)</span></div>
<p>Scientists say a marsquake happens when Martian soil is subjected to a buildup of pressure so great that it causes rock structures to break. So far, the InSight lander has identified, or detected, more than 1,300 marsquakes. The explorer uses a device called a seismometer to detect the ground movements.</p>
<p>The seismometer was designed to be extremely sensitive for the Martian environment. It aims to differentiate between seismic signals coming from inside Mars and activity coming from above the surface, such as wind or <strong>meteorite</strong> strikes.</p>
<p>Researchers look at other things to confirm whether a marsquake was caused by seismic activity below the surface or by an outside force hitting the planet. In the case of the strongest marsquake ever recorded, an international team of scientists looked for evidence of a <strong>crater </strong>that would have been created by a large meteorite hit.</p>
<p>The team was led by researchers from Britain's University of Oxford. But scientists working for space agencies in Europe, China, India and the United Arab Emirates also took part. China has an explorer on Mars and the other agencies all have spacecraft orbiting the planet.</p>
<p>A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103619">recently released study</a> describes the findings in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>
<p>The research team estimated that a 4.7-level marsquake would have created a crater at least 300 meters in diameter. Two other large marsquakes left craters of about 150 meters. So, the researchers searched satellite data collected by InSight as well as the other space agencies.</p>
<p>Each agency examined data from their satellites for evidence of a large crater, as well as other signs that a meteorite might have struck before the largest marsquake. Another sign, team members noted, could have been a dust cloud appearing in the hours after the quake.</p>
<p>But after several months of searching, the researchers said no new, larger crater was found. They said their examinations ruled out a meteorite strike as the cause of the 4.7 marsquake.</p>
<p>The researchers decided instead that the largest marsquake must have been caused by the release of powerful "<strong>tectonic</strong> forces" at work deeper inside the Red Planet. This finding suggests that Mars "is much more seismically active than previously thought," the Oxford University team <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-10-17-new-study-reveals-source-largest-ever-mars-quake">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>Benjamin Fernando is a professor of physics at Oxford University who led the study. He said in a statement that scientists do not believe Mars has ongoing tectonic movements. Rather, Fernando said the team thinks the largest marsquake was "caused by the release of <strong>stress</strong> within Mars' <strong>crust</strong>."</p>
<p>He added that such stress is likely the result of billions of years of development on Mars, including the cooling and shrinking of different parts of the planet at different speeds. "We still do not fully understand why some parts of the planet seem to have higher stresses than others, but results like these help us to investigate further," Fernando said.</p>
<p>Constantinos Charalambous is a planetary scientist at Imperial College London who helped lead the research. He spoke to Reuters news agency about the finding. He said it "represents a significant step forward in our understanding of Martian seismic activity – and takes us one step closer to better <strong>unraveling</strong> the planet's tectonic processes."</p>
<p>Fernando added, "One day, this information may help us to understand where it would be safe for humans to live on Mars and where you might want to avoid."</p>

<p>The stone carvings appeared as a result of a big drop in water levels because of dry weather in parts of northern Brazil.<br/>
这些石刻是由于巴西北部部分地区的干旱天气导致水位大幅下降而出现的。</p>
<p>People had reported some of the rock carvings before during periods when water levels were low. But now a greater number have been identified. That will help researchers establish the history of the carvings, researcher Jaime de Santana Oliveira said recently.<br/>
在水位较低的时期，人们曾报道过一些石刻。但现在已经确认了更多的石刻。研究人员雅伊梅·德桑塔娜·奥利韦拉最近表示，这将有助于研究人员确定这些石刻的历史。</p>

<p>Antonio Vivaldi's famous musical work, <em>The Four Seasons</em>, was first performed in the 1700s.</p>
<p>Many music historians call it a "masterpiece," the musical composer's greatest work.</p>
<p>The <strong>composition</strong> includes four parts for the four seasons: "Spring," "Summer," "Autumn," and "Winter."</p><div class="contentImage"><img a="" against="" alt="Violinist Simon Garcia plays an adaptation of Antonio Vivaldi's famous " an="" as="" change="" climate="" concertos="" day="" four="" image="" in="" international="" madrid="" october="" of="" on="" reuters="" screen="" seasons="" shows="" spain="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/23ac7726-e263-4ea1-81b2-4aebde4e20e1_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" the="" vera="" wildfire=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Violinist Simon Garcia plays an adaptation of Antonio Vivaldi's famous "The Four Seasons" concertos as a screen shows an image of a wildfire on International Day against Climate Change in Madrid, Spain, October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Susana Vera</span></div>
<p>Each part recalls the season it is aiming to describe. For example, the website Galaxy Music Notes says "Summer" has a "slow start, <strong>portraying</strong> the weather as too hot for any movement."</p>
<p>"Autumn" is a "celebration of the harvest."</p>
<p>One music director in Spain decided to <strong>interpret</strong> the 300-year-old work for modern times. The composer and producer Hache Costa told the Reuters news agency that Vivaldi's work would have been "a lot more aggressive and dirty" if it was written today.</p>
<p>Costa said the weather is so different now that "if today someone were to compose the Four Seasons from a...realistic perspective, it would be...<strong>daring</strong>."</p>
<p>So, he updated Vivaldi's piece to reflect the real world. The work is now being performed in Madrid at the EDP Gran Via concert hall. Reuters said he added "<strong>prominence</strong> and drama" to the summer portion and shortened the other seasons because of global warming.</p>
<p>The musical group, or orchestra, performs the music in front of a video screen showing the effects of climate change – such as wildfires and dry weather. One part shows the clouds involved in a hurricane.</p>
<p>Costa created the adaptation of <em>The Four Seasons</em> to go along with the recent Global Climate Action Day.</p>
<p>He said he wants people listening to "feel really <strong>bothered</strong>...by becoming truly aware of what is happening."</p>
<p>He said the sheet music is freely available for anyone to play.</p>
<p>Ernesto Rodriguez Camino is president of the Spanish Meteorological Society. He said the effects of climate change in Spain could be "<strong>catastrophic</strong>."</p>
<p>He said periods of high heat will last longer and bring wildfires and the chance of strong rainfall.</p>
<p>When asked, Costa, the composer, said he did not think Vivaldi would have a problem with his changes.</p>

<p>Vietnam plans to restart its biggest rare earths mine next year. The project could greatly increase the supply of the elements to compete with China. The rare earth minerals help power advanced technologies.</p>
<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says rare earths are a set of 17 metallic elements that are necessary in the production of high-tech products from mobile phones and electric vehicles to <strong>advanced</strong> weapons.</p>
<p>China only has about one-third of the world's rare earth reserves. But a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.brinknews.com/china-is-moving-rapidly-up-the-rare-earth-value-chain/#:~:text=Although%20it%20has%20only%20about,rare%20earth%20permanent%20magnets%20manufactured.">2022 study</a> from Marsh McLennan says that the country now controls more than 60 percent of rare earth mining and 85 percent of processing capacity worldwide.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rare earth oxide samples are seen at mining company VTRE in Hanoi, Vietnam September 7, 2023.

<p>The USGS estimates that Vietnam has the world's second-largest rare earth reserves after China. They have remained largely unmined. Last September, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an agreement during his Vietnam visit to help the country with getting investors to open mining operations.</p>
<p>The agreement is a step toward helping the Southeast Asian country build up a rare-earths supply chain. The deal's terms include developing the country's ability to turn raw elements into metals used in magnets for electric vehicles, smartphones and wind turbines.</p>
<p>As a first step, Vietnam's government plans to auction several areas of its Dong Pao mine to investors before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Tessa Kutscher is an executive at Australia's Blackstone Minerals, a company that plans to <strong>bid</strong> on the project. Kutscher told Reuters news agency that Blackstone's investment would be worth around $100 million if it wins. She added that the company was talking to electric car makers, including VinFast and Rivian, about possible supply contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Dong Pao mine</strong></p>
<p>The Dong Pao mine has been inactive for at least seven years. Two Japanese companies, Toyota Tsusho and Sojitz, left mining projects at Dong Pao after China greatly increased the rare earth supply to bring the prices down.</p>
<p>Refining rare earths is complex and China controls many processing technologies.</p>
<p>Still, Hanoi University of Mining and Geology says that rare earths at Dong Pao are relatively easy to mine and are mostly concentrated in bastnaesite ores. These rare earth ores will then be ground into powder and processed into rare-earth oxide (REO).</p>
<p>Luu Anh Tuan is the chairman of Vietnam Rare Earth (VTRE). The company is Vietnam's main refiner and Blackstone's partner in the project. He expected Dong Pao to produce about 30,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide <strong>equivalent</strong> a year.</p>
<p>That amount would put Dong Pao's output a little below that of California's Mountain Pass, one of the world's largest mines, which produced 43,000 metric tons of the element in 2022.</p>
<p>In July, Vietnam's government said it planned to develop additional mines to produce up to 60,000 tons of REO equivalent a year by 2030. China set its own target of 210,000 tons last year.</p>
<p>Once separated, oxides are turned into metals for use in magnets and other industrial products. China is the world's leader of the metallization process, producing 90 percent of rare-earth metals, the U.S. Department of Energy says.</p>
<p>But VTRE is working on a project to build a metallization factory with South Korea's Setopia.</p>
<p>Dudley Kingsnorth is a professor at the Western Australia School of Mines at Curtin University. He said Vietnam had some way to go to reach its rare-earth goals. Still, he said, Vietnam "has the resources, the mining and processing expertise to provide <strong>alternatives</strong> to China."</p>

<p>Scientists say a mineral found in moon dust suggests Earth's moon is 40 million years older than scientists had believed.</p>
<p>The finding was made by researchers who examined moon <strong>samples</strong> gathered by astronauts from the lunar surface in 1972 – the last time humans walked on the moon. The samples were part of a collection of 110 kilograms of dust and rock returned to Earth for scientific study.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/">says</a> the leading theory on how the moon formed involves a huge crash. NASA says a Mars-sized object likely crashed into Earth and released material from both objects, which formed the moon.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, the crescent Earth rises above the lunar horizon in this undated NASA handout photograph taken from the Apollo 17 spacecraft in lunar orbit during the final lunar landing mission in the Apollo program in 1972.

(REUTERS/NASA/Handout)</span></div>
<p>But the exact timing of when the moon was created has been difficult to identify. A new study based on the 1972 samples suggests the moon formed about 4.46 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The research was led by a team from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. The findings were recently published <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article2334/">in a study</a> in <em>Geochemical Perspective Letters</em>.</p>
<p>The study examined small <strong>crystals</strong> found in the lunar dust. The team said the crystals contained a mineral called zircon. The zircon is believed to have formed when the lunar surface cooled after being in a melting state after the crash.</p>
<p>The method used to estimate the age of the dust sample is called atom probe tomography. This method had not been developed when the sample was collected 51 years ago, said Philipp Heck. He is the lead writer of the study and the senior director of research at the Field Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>NASA said the lunar sample was collected from an area known as the Taurus-Littrow valley on the near side of the moon. The near side of the moon is the side that always faces Earth. The sample had been stored at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>Heck noted that zircon is a very strong mineral that can "survive the breakdown of rocks during weathering."</p>
<p>The new study followed an earlier one carried out in 2021. In that study, researchers examined how many atoms of uranium and lead were contained in the zircon crystals. They then estimated the age of the mineral based on differences in the <strong>decay</strong> of the radioactive uranium to lead over time.</p>
<p>But the purpose of the new study was to confirm the earlier study's results, which were not considered <strong>conclusive</strong>. The examinations of the sample material were carried out atom-by-atom with very sensitive instruments, the researchers <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/press/crystals-brought-back-by-astronauts-show-that-the-moon-is-40-million-years-older">said</a>.</p>
<p>Jennika Greer is a researcher in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. She helped lead the study. Greer told Reuters news agency the finding is "a great example of what the nanoscale, or even atomic <strong>scale</strong>, can tell us about big-picture questions."</p>
<p>Heck, from the Field Museum, said the huge crash that formed the moon was a major event that changed Earth's rotational speed. He added, "The formation date of the moon is important as only after that Earth became a <strong>habitable</strong> planet."</p>
<p>Greer said she hopes the team's finding can be a basis for answering many remaining questions about the moon. "It's amazing being able to have proof that the rock you're holding is the oldest bit of the Moon we've found so far." She added, "When you know how old something is, you can better understand what has happened to it in its history."</p>

<p>Many American education experts are concerned about students' performance in the subject of mathematics.</p>
<p>Scores on <strong>standardized tests</strong> are falling, students are having trouble learning high-level math in college and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/educators-improving-teachers-math-skills-will-aid-students-/7258594.html">some teachers</a> do not feel prepared to teach math to young people.</p>
<p>Laura Jackson's daughter was nine years old when she discovered that she was having a learning problem that her school was not prepared to deal with.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Preschool students practice math using manipulatives at a public school in Boston in 2016. (Lillian Mongeau/The Hechinger Report via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/1a36256a-b5e8-44ab-8bb9-fca954e1d466_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Preschool students practice math using manipulatives at a public school in Boston in 2016. (Lillian Mongeau/The Hechinger Report via AP)</span></div>
<p>Jackson said she started to worry about her daughter when she was having problems with math in third grade. She said other students had no trouble doing <strong>multiplication</strong> problems, but her daughter still used her fingers to count.</p>
<p><strong>Discovering dyscalculia</strong></p>
<p>At that point, the girl asked her mother if she was "stupid." She was still having trouble with math although she had been working with a special math teacher.</p>
<p>Then Jackson heard about a learning problem from a friend. It is called dyscalculia. She looked up the learning disability and found that the learning problem prevents children from understanding numbers and learning math.</p>
<p>"I was like, ‘Oh my <strong>gosh</strong>, this is my kid'," Jackson said.</p>
<p>Around the U.S., hundreds of thousands of students might have a math-learning problem such as dyscalculia. However, most schools are not prepared to deal with the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Easier to find reading problems</strong></p>
<p>Schools are getting better at discovering learning problems. States passed laws that require testing young students for problems such as dyslexia, a common reading disability. But schools are not yet required to test for problems with numbers. One study, published by the National Library of Medicine in 2019, said between three and seven percent of the population has dyscalculia.</p>
<p>Karen Wilson is a neuropsychologist who tests children for learning problems. "There's not as much research on math disorders," when compared to reading problems, she said.</p>
<p>Math test scores have been decreasing in the U.S. for years, but the numbers got worse after the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way students learned. Few teachers say anyone has tested their students for dyscalculia.</p>
<p>Education experts say the kind of slow and repetitive math teaching that helps students with dyscalculia might also help other students.</p>
<p>Sandra Elliott currently works for TouchMath, an education company that sells a math teaching program. She used to be a special education teacher. She said schools that change their teaching to help students who have "severe disconnections and slower processing speeds," will also help other students get better at math.</p>
<p>Some schools, such as the one Jackson's daughter attended, do not always believe students have a serious math learning problem when they do well in other subjects.</p>
<p>Jackson researched dyscalculia on her own and decided to write a book about her family's problems. She found many schools do not know about the problem.</p>
<p>She said parents think schools will let them know if their child is having trouble, "but that's just not how it works."</p>
<p><strong>How to help students</strong></p>
<p>Lynn Fuchs is a professor in special education and human development at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. She said students with math learning problems need "<strong>systematic</strong> and <strong>explicit</strong>" teaching. That means they need math teachers who have learned how to help students who have a math disability. Most do not have enough training. For example, some states require teachers to get dyslexia awareness training in order to renew their teaching permit. But no such requirement exists for dyscalculia.</p>
<p>Amelia Malone is a director at the National Center for Learning Disabilities. She said there are not enough high-level degrees in education that center on math learning disabilities "with any level of...depth, quality or <strong>rigor</strong>."</p>
<p>In addition, most schools do not have specialists who can work with math learning problems. Jackson said she took it upon herself to learn how to teach students with dyscalculia and started giving her daughter extra help.</p>
<p>In New York City, some schools do look for math problems among their students. In 2015 and 2016, the city spent $6 million to introduce a math program with games, art projects and songs. However, most school systems do not do that.</p>
<p>Some education experts say students, such as Jackson's daughter, could improve if schools used different methods to teach math to young people. These could include games, wooden blocks, body motions and songs.</p>
<p>After spending time working with her daughter, Jackson said the girl returned to classes and as her education continued, she started getting good grades in Algebra.</p>
<p>She said students need to understand they are not "bad at math." They need help learning and can then succeed in the subject.</p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself in a group of people with similar ways of thinking and interests to yours? They understand you. They really get you. They may even be wearing similar clothing to yours.</p>
<p>We have a great expression for this: <u>Birds of a feather <strong>flock</strong> together</u>. This means people of the same kind or with the same tastes and interests often find each other.</p>
<p>Artists may spend time with other artists. Lawyers often talk about legal issues or court cases with other lawyers. And people who love languages like to discuss grammar and words with other language-loving people.</p>
<p>We have many similar expressions, and many of them use the word "mind" or "brain."</p>
<p>If someone thinks like me, I can say we are <u>like-minded.</u> I can also say we <u>are of like mind</u> or <u>of the same mind</u>.</p>
<p>There is also something called a <strong><u>hive</u></strong><u> mind</u>. In a beehive, the bees all work together to achieve the same goal. People who are part of a <u>hive mind</u> have similar thoughts, ideas, and opinions. They often work together to discuss an issue or solve a problem.</p>
<p>And sometimes, I can joke that I share <u>the same brain</u> with those who share my thinking and <strong>attitudes</strong>.</p>
<p>If you a spiritual kind of person, you can call them your <strong><u>kindred</u></strong><u> spirits</u>. If you are more of a science person, you can say you are <u>on the same <strong>wavelength.</strong> </u></p>
<p>And if you are a person who likes to make things, you can use these two expressions: <u>cut from the same cloth,</u> <strong><u>cast</u></strong><u> from the same <strong>mold</strong>.</u></p>
<p>All these expressions mean the same thing -- you feel a strong connection to someone and feel very similar to them.</p>
<p>We have another expression that can also be used in this situation. But we only use it when we have a similar idea with another person: <u>great minds think alike</u>.</p>
<p>If you often listen to VOA Learning English, you belong to a community of <u>like-minded</u> people: People who want to practice their English.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He was also known as Jack Kennedy, or by the letters JFK.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - John F. Kennedy" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/2145b47f-b40b-482b-9a06-bf2f4c5cc4e3_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - John F. Kennedy</span></div>
<p>When he took office in 1961, Kennedy was 43 years old. He was the youngest elected president in United States' history.</p>
<p>Kennedy was also the first Catholic to be elected U.S. president.</p>
<p>Kennedy's youth and religion raised questions in the minds of some Americans that Kennedy could lead the country. They wondered if he would always follow the policies of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>But Kennedy became well-known as a statesman, and popular with people around the world. He was intelligent, funny and good-looking. For many, Kennedy was a sign of new energy and hope.</p>
<p>The public was shocked, then, when the president's term was violently cut short.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>John F. Kennedy was born in 1917 near Boston, Massachusetts. He was the second of nine children.</p>
<p>Both his parents were Catholic, with ancestors from Ireland. Many years ago, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/12/america-history-of-hating-catholics">Irish Catholics often faced discrimination</a> in the United States. But the Kennedy family was also politically powerful and wealthy.</p>
<p>As a result, young Jack Kennedy grew up in big, beautiful houses and received a top quality education. His family did not suffer during the Great Depression, as many Americans had. Instead, the Kennedy children swam, sailed boats and played sports.</p>
<p>Jack also enjoyed reading books and following the news. His older brother Joe wanted to enter politics, but Jack said he might become a teacher or writer. When he was a college student at Harvard, Jack wrote a long paper about Britain in the years leading up to World War II. A version of it was published in 1940 as a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-England-Slept-John-Kennedy/dp/4871877671">book</a>.</p>
<p>The war changed Jack's thinking about his future plans. During World War II, both Jack and his older brother joined the U.S. Navy. In the Pacific, Jack became a hero. He won medals for leading some of his troops to safety after a Japanese warship struck a boat they were on.</p>
<p>But Joe was killed. In 1944, his airplane exploded over Europe.</p>
<p>When the war ended, Jack's father urged him to follow his brother's dream of succeeding in politics. Jack agreed, and he set his sights on becoming the country's first Catholic president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Kennedy was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate, and he was elected in 1960.</p>
<p>He easily defeated Vice President Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate, in the Electoral College. But Kennedy won only narrowly in the popular vote.</p>
<p>Though he was young, Kennedy brought experience to the job. In addition to being a naval officer, Kennedy had been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a senator from Massachusetts.</p>
<p>He also published a Pulitzer Prize-winning book called "Profiles in Courage."</p>
<p>And he had become a husband and father. He married a wealthy, well-educated woman who had been working as a newspaper photographer. Her name was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/jacquelinekennedy">Jacqueline Bouvier</a>, but she was sometimes called Jackie.</p>
<p>She became pregnant five times, but only two of her children would survive: a daughter named Caroline, and a son, John F. Kennedy, Junior.</p>
<p>The family of four moved into the White House in January 1961. On the day he was sworn-in, Kennedy gave a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/sixties/essays/john-f-kennedy%E2%80%99s-inaugural-address">speech</a> that many people still remember today. It celebrated the "new generation of Americans," and promised to "pay any price" for liberty.</p>
<p>Supporters of the new president loved his energy and sense of hope. In his most famous line, Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country."</p>
<p>Many young people remembered that line when they volunteered for a program Kennedy created in 1961: the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>Other Americans remembered the line when they watched two Apollo 11 astronauts walk on the moon in 1969. Kennedy strongly supported the country's space program. He promised that Americans would land on the moon by the end of the 1960s, and they did.</p>
<p>Kennedy also supported efforts to improve civil rights across the U.S., although his administration moved slowly. Calls to end legalized racism were growing stronger during Kennedy's time in office, particularly because of the leadership of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-bio.html">Martin Luther King, Junior</a>.</p>
<p>In June of 1963, King spoke to hundreds of thousands of people at a civil rights protest called the March on Washington. He told the crowd that he dreamed "my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the <strong>content</strong> of their character."</p>
<p>The March on Washington, among other events, showed the power of the civil rights movement. In late 1963, President Kennedy sent a civil rights bill to Congress and spoke to Americans about the injustice that remained in the country.</p>
<p>The Peace Corps, the Space Race, and civil rights are all part of Kennedy's <strong>legacy</strong>.</p>
<p>Kennedy is also remembered for several troubling international events. In one, known as the Bay of Pigs, Americans supported Cuban refugees in an effort to oust the government of Fidel Castro. Not only did the refugees fail, but Kennedy's government was found to be lying about their support of the effort.</p>
<p>And Kennedy faced off with the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev. In 1962, American leaders learned that the Soviets had hidden nuclear weapons in Cuba. The missiles would be able to reach the U.S. mainland easily.</p>
<p>Kennedy ordered a blockade of Cuba. People around the world held their breath as they waited to see if the U.S. and the Soviet Union would launch a nuclear war. They did not. After several very tense weeks, Kennedy and Khrushchev reached an agreement that ended the crisis.</p>
<p>Kennedy went on to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union and Britain to limit nuclear weapons testing. He said the agreement was one of the presidential acts of which he was most satisfied.</p>
<p>Historians still debate Kennedy's actions, and what else might have happened during his presidency. They wonder especially what he would have done about the increasing conflict in Vietnam.</p>
<p>But Kennedy did not live to finish his first term.</p>
<p><strong>Death</strong></p>
<p>By November 22, 1963, Kennedy had been president for just under three years. The next election was still a year away, but it was time to start campaigning again.</p>
<p>So the president and his wife went to Dallas, Texas to connect with voters. They were riding in a car with other official vehicles that drove slowly through the center of the city. Jack, Jackie, and the Texas governor and his wife sat in a convertible – an automobile without protection over the seats.</p>
<p>The president was waving at the crowd. Suddenly, several gunshots were fired. The president was struck twice.</p>
<p>The governor was also hit and injured.</p>
<p>Kennedy was hurried to a hospital, but doctors were unable to help him. News reporters announced his death to a stunned public.</p>
<p>Hours later, Jackie Kennedy appeared next to the former vice president – now president – Lyndon Johnson. She still wore the clothes with her husband's blood on them.</p>
<p>The events remain intense in the minds of many Americans who were alive at the time. The images remain easily recognizable parts of American history. The pictures of Kennedy's family at his funeral are especially memorable. In one, three-year-old John holds up his arm and salutes his father's <strong>casket</strong>.</p>
<p>Attention quickly turned to the gunman. It was reportedly a 24-year-old man named <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/25/jfks-assassin-lee-harvey-oswalds-eerie-calm-the-day-before-he-pulled-the-trigger/?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-in-the-news%3Apage%2Fin-the-news&amp;tid=sm_tw&amp;utm_term=.511aa2475a9e">Lee Harvey Oswald</a>. Shortly after the president and the governor were shot, Oswald shot a policeman who questioned him.</p>
<p>Oswald was eventually detained. Officials planned to bring him to court for the death of the president and the policeman. But on the way from the police station to the jail, a local <strong>night-club</strong> owner shot and killed Oswald.</p>
<p>As a result, the case never came to trial. Many Americans believe the reason for the attack has yet to be clarified.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy </strong></p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://millercenter.org/president/kennedy/impact-and-legacy">Historians have a mixed reaction</a> to Kennedy's years as a president, although their opinions are generally <strong>positive</strong>.</p>
<p>His image with the public suffered some years after his death because of reports that he had romantic relationships with women other than Jackie throughout his marriage.</p>
<p>In time, the public also learned about Kennedy's health problems. He suffered from severe back pain and Addison's disease. He often used strong medicine to help control the conditions. The health problems are <strong>at odds</strong> with Kennedy's image of health and love of sports.</p>
<p>Yet even with these new details, Kennedy is still one of the country's best-remembered leaders. He was a <strong>charismatic</strong> man whose career influenced many other Americans to enter public service.</p>
<p>Americans also remember his stylish, cultured wife. Jackie Kennedy compared the Kennedy years at the White House to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.livescience.com/28992-camelot.html">Camelot</a>, the legendary court of King Arthur.</p>
<p>Their remains, along with those of two of their children, are buried at <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Monuments-and-Memorials/President-John-F-Kennedy-Gravesite">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, across the Potomac River from Washington. They are honored there with an <strong>eternal flame</strong> – one designed so the fire will never go out.</p>

<p>The North Atlantic right whale is one of the world's most endangered large whale <strong>species</strong>.</p>
<p>Its population loss appears to be slowing. But scientists warn that the large sea animals still face threats from getting caught in fishing equipment, being struck by ships, and warming oceans.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A North Atlantic right whale feeds on the surface of Cape Cod bay off the coast of Plymouth, Mass., March 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/74e35c76-344c-467e-935b-85c58896f2e5_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A North Atlantic right whale feeds on the surface of Cape Cod bay off the coast of Plymouth, Mass., March 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)</span></div>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/north-atlantic-right-whale/overview">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) says that by the early 1890s, <strong>commercial</strong> whalers almost destroyed the species. They got their name from being the "right" whales to hunt because they floated when they were killed.</p>
<p>Commercial whale fishing is no longer a threat, but its population has never fully returned. They have been protected under United States law for many years now.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic right whale is about 16 meters long and weighs more than 63,000 kilograms. The whales can probably live for 70 years. However, female North Atlantic right whales are now only living to around 45 years old. Such reduced <strong>lifespans</strong> are caused by human activities, not old age.</p>
<p>The NOAA estimates that fewer than 350 right whales are remaining off the U.S. East Coast. From 2010 to 2020, their population fell by about 25 percent.</p>
<p>This week, the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.narwc.org/">North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium</a> (NARWC) said the population decrease appears to have leveled off. A strong birthing year in 2021, when 18 baby whales, or calves, were born, kept whale population numbers up, the NARWC said.</p>
<p>However, the organization warned that the high number of deaths faced by whales from getting caught in fishing equipment or struck by ships remains a major problem for the whales.</p>
<p>"The news is less bad than it has been. My heart is a little less heavy, but certainly not light or hopeful," said Philip Hamilton. He is a member of NARWC and a senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium. "It shouldn't be dependent on the whales to give birth to enough calves to <strong>reverse</strong> what we're doing to them."</p>
<p>Scientists say another reason why whale numbers are decreasing is warming oceans and climate change. The whales eat very small ocean organisms called copepods. They travel from calving grounds off the coasts of Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada every year.</p>
<p>As waters have warmed, the whales must travel outside of protected areas of the ocean in search of food. That has left them open to strikes with large ships and getting trapped in commercial fishing equipment. Those are the biggest causes of early death.</p>
<p>Many fishermen have opposed proposed fishing restrictions that they fear would hurt their business rather than help whales. Dave Cousens, a past president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, has called the proposed rules "<strong>nonsensical</strong>."</p>
<p>But environmental groups want new federal rules to save the species, including one to make ships slow down for whales.</p>

<p>A "new" song from the Beatles, with help from artificial intelligence, comes out next week.</p>
<p>The song, called <em>Now And Then</em>, will be available on November 2. It is part of a single along with <em>Love Me Do</em>. In 1962, <em>Love Me Do</em> came out as the first Beatles single.</p>
<p><em>Now And Then </em>comes from the same group of unreleased recordings written by Beatle John Lennon, who died in 1980. His former bandmates used some of the media to build the songs <em>Free As a Bir</em>d and <em>Real Love</em> released in the mid-1990s.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this Aug. 23, 1966 file photo, The Beatles, from left, Ringo Starr; Paul McCartney; John Lennon; and George Harrison appear at a press conference in New York.

(AP Photo)</span></div>
<p>Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison worked on <em>Now And Then</em> at the same time. But, technological limitations blocked their progress. George Harrison died in 2001.</p>
<p>With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), movie director Peter Jackson was able to solve those tech problems. He used AI to "separate" Lennon's voice from the sound of the piano used in the late 1970s recording. The much clearer vocals permitted the surviving members, McCartney and Starr, to complete the song last year.</p>
<p>The new single contains guitar work that Harrison had recorded almost 30 years ago. Drummer Starr provided new sound along with McCartney's bass, piano and guitar. McCartney and Starr also sang with Lennon.</p>
<p>McCartney also added a string instrument piece written with the help of Giles Martin, son of the late Beatles producer George Martin.</p>
<p>And, they weaved in background singing<strong> </strong>from the first Beatles recordings of <em>Here, There and Everywhere</em>, <em>Eleanor Rigby</em> and <em>Because</em>.</p>
<p>"There it was, John's voice, <strong>crystal</strong> clear," McCartney said in the announcement of the new song. "It's quite emotional. And we all play on it," he added.</p>
<p>Harrison's <strong>widow</strong>, Olivia, said "he would have wholeheartedly" joined Paul and Ringo in completing the song now if he were still alive.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, the day before the song's release, a 12-minute film that tells the story of the new recording will be made public.</p>
<p>Later in the month, expanded versions of the Beatles' albums <em>1962-1966</em> and <em>1967-1970, </em>will be released. The later years' collection will get the addition of the song <em>Now And Then</em>.</p>
<p>The surviving Beatles have skillfully released new projects. They made remixes of old albums. They also worked with director Jackson's 2021 documentary series, <em>The Beatles</em>: <em>Get Back</em>.</p>
<p>This year is the big <strong>finale</strong> of new Beatles music.</p>
<p>"This is the last track, ever, that you'll get the four Beatles on the track. John, Paul, George, and Ringo," Starr said in a recent interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the use of "this, that, these, those."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-5d19-08dbd649089c_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Please, how should I use the pronouns "this, that, these, those" beyond the <strong>notion</strong> of near or far?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>Odilon</p>
<p><strong>Answer </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Odilon. This is an excellent question!</p>
<p>We know that the words "this, that, these, those" have many meanings and uses in English.</p>
<p>One meaning of "this/these" is to note someone or something is near in physical distance. "That/those" can note someone or something that is far in physical distance. Here are two examples:</p>
<p><em>You can say, "<u>This</u> book is mine" while holding it in your hand. </em></p>
<p><em>And you can say, "<u>That</u> book is yours" while pointing at one on the table across the room. </em></p>
<p><strong>Time </strong></p>
<p>Near and far can also demonstrate time. "This" can mean now or current, and "that" can mean before or earlier. For example,</p>
<p><em>The solar <strong>eclipse</strong> will not happen again <u>this</u> year. </em></p>
<p><em>The last supermoon came in September. At <u>that</u> time, the moon's orbit brought it closer than usual to Earth. </em></p>
<p>In the first sentence, "this" notes the current year. In the second sentence, "that" refers to a time in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Preference </strong></p>
<p>We can also use "this/that" to show preference or a desirable choice. "This" can demonstrate a more desirable choice, and "that" can demonstrate a less desirable choice. Here are two examples:</p>
<p><em><u>This</u> is my favorite restaurant. </em></p>
<p><em><u>That</u> doesn't sound very fun. </em></p>
<p>In the first sentence, "this" shows the restaurant is the best choice, and "that" in the second sentence demonstrates the idea is not a desirable one.</p>
<p><strong>Focus, or attention </strong></p>
<p>"This/these" also has an additional use. We can use "this/these" for focus, or attention, to establish new information. Using "this/these" can direct the reader's or listener's attention to important information. Here is an example.</p>
<p><em>And <u>this</u> is one major concern about the use of artificial intelligence: ownership. </em></p>
<p>"This" directs the reader to pay attention to the new information that is coming in the sentence. The important information in the sentence is a major concern. Ownership is the major concern.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Odilon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>China launched its youngest-ever crew for its orbiting space station Thursday. The launch is part of the country's plan to put astronauts on the moon before 2030.<br/>
中国周四将其有史以来最年轻的航天员送上了轨道空间站。此次发射是中国在2030年前将航天员送上月球计划的一部分。</p>
<p>The Shenzhou 17 spacecraft lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China at 03:14 UTC. The China Manned Space Agency said the average age of the three-member crew is the youngest since the launch of the space station. Their average age is 38, state media China Daily said.<br/>
神舟十七号宇宙飞船于协调世界时03:14从中国西北部的酒泉卫星发射中心升空。中国载人航天局表示，这3名机组人员的平均年龄是天宫空间站发射以来最年轻的。据官方媒体《中国日报》报道，他们的平均年龄为38岁。</p>
<p>The three astronauts are Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie, and Jiang Xinlin. They will replace a crew that has been on the station for six months.<br/>
这三名航天员分别是汤洪波、唐胜杰和江新林。他们将接替已经在空间站工作了六个月的航天员乘组。</p>
<p>The new crew will perform experiments in space medicine, space technology, and other areas during their mission. And they will help to place and do possible repairs to equipment inside and outside the station, the agency said.<br/>
这个新的航天员乘组将在任务期间进行太空医学、太空技术和其他领域的实验。该机构表示，他们将帮助安装空间站内外的设备，并对其进行可能的维修。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New space race<br/>
新太空竞赛</span></p>
<p>China also has plans to place astronauts on the moon before the end of 2030 in competition with the United States in space exploration. This follows other competition for influence between the world's two largest economies in the technology, military, and diplomatic fields.<br/>
中国还计划与美国在太空探索方面展开竞争，在2030年底前将航天员送上月球。此前，世界上最大的这两个经济体在技术、军事和外交领域展开了其他影响力竞争。</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the Chinese space agency also announced plans to send a new telescope to look deep into the universe. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said the telescope would permit for mapping of the sky, but no timeline was given for when it would be placed.<br/>
周三早些时候，中国航天局还宣布计划发射一台新望远镜深入探索宇宙。中国国家广播公司CCTV表示，该望远镜将允许绘制天空地图，但没有给出任何具体的时间表。</p>
<p>In 2022, the Chinese government built its own space station after it was not permitted to join the U.S.-led International Space Station.<br/>
在未被允许加入美国领导的国际空间站后，中国政府于2022年建造了自己的空间站。</p>
<p>China's first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources.<br/>
2003年，中国首次执行载人航天任务，成为继前苏联和美国之后第三个利用本国资源将航天员送入太空的国家。</p>
<p>The American space program is believed to be far ahead of China at this time. But, China has made some important steps. They include bringing back samples from the moon's surface for the first time in many years and landing a vehicle on the less explored far side of the moon.<br/>
据信，美国的太空计划目前远远领先于中国。但是，中国已经取得一些重要的进展。其中包括多年来首次从月球表面带回样本，以及将一辆运载工具降落在探索较少的月球背面。</p>
<p>The U.S., meanwhile, aims to put astronauts back on the moon's surface by the end of 2025. It is aided by private American companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.<br/>
与此同时，美国的目标是在2025年底前让航天员重返月球表面。它得到了像太空探索技术公司和蓝色起源公司这样的美国私营公司的帮助。</p>
<p>In addition to their moon, or lunar, programs, the two countries have also separately landed vehicles on Mars. And China plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid.<br/>
除了月球计划外，两国还分别在火星上着陆了运载工具。中国计划效仿美国，将一艘宇宙飞船降落在小行星上。</p>

<p>Astronomers have<strong> detected</strong> radio waves coming from what looks like a joining of galaxies from about 8 billion years ago. The discovery is the oldest-known example of an event that is difficult to explain: a fast radio<strong> burst</strong>.</p>
<p>In less than a <strong>millisecond</strong>, this burst released the amount of energy our sun releases in thirty years, scientists said.</p>
<p>The Australian SKA Pathfinder, a radio telescope in the state of Western Australia, detected the burst. And the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, one of the most powerful telescopes, found the <strong>location</strong> of the burst.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This artist's impression, not to scale, illustrates the path of a fast radio burst from the distant galaxy where it originated all the way to Earth in this handout picture obtained on October 20, 2023.

<p>A fast radio burst, or FRB, is a kind of radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation. It lasts less than a millisecond but outshines most other sources of radio waves in the universe. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>Ryan Shannon, an astronomer at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, was a co-leader of the study published recently in Science.</p>
<p>He said radio waves in FRBs are similar to those used in microwave ovens. And he added that this FRB had the same amount of energy needed to microwave "a bowl of popcorn twice the size of the sun."</p>
<p>Until now, the oldest-known such burst dated to 5 billion years ago, making this one 3 billion years older. The universe is about 13.8 billion years old. For comparison, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.</p>
<p>In seeing objects and events from long ago, researchers look across large distances, making this burst also the farthest of any FRB ever detected.</p>
<p>"We now know that fast radio bursts have been around for more than half the age of the universe," said study co-leader Stuart Ryder of Macquarie University in Australia.</p>
<p>Researchers first discovered fast radio bursts in 2007.</p>
<p>The most likely source is a special kind of "<strong>neutron star</strong>, called a magnetar. These stars ... are some of the most extreme objects in the universe, which you would need to produce such extreme bursts," Shannon said.</p>
<p>"There are more energetic events in the universe, associated with <strong>stellar</strong> explosions or a black hole <strong>shredding</strong> a star apart. But FRBs are <strong>unique</strong> in that they produce all their energy in radio waves, with nothing seen in other bands - optical light or X-rays for example - and that the signals are so short," Shannon added.</p>
<p>They also are more common, Shannon explained, with around 100,000 thought to happen somewhere in the universe daily. Far fewer have been detected, Shannon said, and only around 50 - including this one - have been <strong>traced</strong> back to the galaxy where they began.</p>
<p>The scientists said that studying these bursts can help to detect and measure the large amount of matter believed to populate the large distances of space between galaxies.</p>

<p>The U.S. State Department is working on a test program that would permit some work visa holders to <strong>renew</strong> their documents in the United States.</p>
<p>The pilot program would involve holders of H-1B visas. This kind of visa permits highly skilled foreigners to enter the U.S. for work purposes for at least three years.</p>
<p>Currently, H-1B visa holders are required to travel to an American diplomatic office outside the U.S. to seek renewals</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A visa application center of VFS Global is seen in Istanbul, Turkey, Aug. 25, 2022. " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-c0a3-08db896660c8_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A visa application center of VFS Global is seen in Istanbul, Turkey, Aug. 25, 2022. </span></div>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA the pilot program aims to improve "the <strong>uncertainty</strong> often experienced by U.S. companies" that temporarily employ H-1B workers. The official communicated by email. The official spoke to VOA on the condition that they not be identified.</p>
<p>The official said that the State Department would judge whether the policy change would improve the availability and speed of visa approvals worldwide.</p>
<p>Immigration lawyers have long urged the administration of President Joe Biden to bring back U.S. visa renewals that were ended in 2004. They say the current renewal process can make it difficult for U.S.-based foreign employees to get appointments at U.S. diplomatic offices abroad. And the travel linked to those appointments can be very costly.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the State Department is hoping to begin accepting renewal documents by the end of this year. The program is to begin with officials inviting a small number of visa holders to take part.</p>
<p>But the spokesperson said the program must first go through a rule-making process, which will start at the White House. Once those rules are decided, the State Department will seek public comments and consider any necessary changes. The proposal will then go back to the White House for final review.</p>

<p>An interesting holiday in the United States is coming up soon. Halloween happens on the last day of October. If you have lived in the U.S., you have probably noticed many changes in the month or so before Halloween. Let's hear about some of them and explore the vocabulary and expressions you might hear this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>‘Trick-or-treat'</strong></p>
<p>First, you should know about trick-or-treating. Children <strong>dress</strong> <strong>up</strong> in special clothes, or costumes, to look like frightening creatures. They might dress up as little <strong>vampires</strong>, <strong>ghosts</strong> and <strong>witches </strong>or superheroes. Then their parents walk with them to the homes of neighbors, where the children knock at the door and call out, "Trick or treat!"</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-4cc8-08dbd581255f_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Some people believe the custom goes back to an old Celtic celebration in which people went from door to door asking for firewood. The Celts believed that the spirits of the dead would return to their homes on October 31, the day of the autumn feast. The Celts would build large fires to frighten away evil spirits on that night.</p>
<p>In modern-day Halloween, the children ask for candy. That's the "treat" part. The "trick" part is what happens if you do not give them something.</p>
<p>Before Halloween, communities might create a "<strong>haunted</strong> house" in an old house or an open field. Visitors can walk through the place and be frightened and surprised by unusual noises and people dressed up like ghosts or spirits.</p>
<p>Fear plays a big part in Halloween celebrations. The words we use to talk about fear include "scary," an adjective to show something causes fear and "afraid" an adjective that describes the person who feels fear. We might say, "I'm scared of ghosts," to say we are afraid of ghosts.</p>
<p>Another word we use to describe things that cause fear is "<strong>spooky</strong>." Little people trying to look like ghosts might say, "Boo!" to frighten others. Let's put some of these expressions together to see how they work.</p>
<p><em>Greg has a really scary costume this year. He said "Boo!" to me and I jumped!</em></p>
<p><em>Caty's house looks really spooky with all those skeletons and spider webs that she put out in her yard.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm not afraid of ghosts but seeing people dressed up as witches scares me!</em></p>
<p>You will see that stores begin offering many kinds of candies in small packages. We call these "individually wrapped" treats. They are meant for handing out to children as part of trick-or-treating. Some candy makers call these small packages "fun-sized" treats.</p>
<p><strong>Halloween decorations</strong></p>
<p>People put some strange things on and around their homes for Halloween. People hang toy spiders, skeletons and other scary <strong>decorations</strong> on trees and bushes. You will see pumpkins everywhere. People often empty the pumpkins and make scary faces on them. Then they place a candle inside so the pumpkin face shines in the night. We call these "jack-o-lanterns."</p>
<p>The custom of carving scary faces into vegetables is believed to come to us from the Irish. They had an old story about a wandering soul named Stingy Jack. They carved faces in turnips to frighten him away. When they came to America, they found the pumpkin was widely available. So, they carved faces into pumpkins, and made what we call the jack-o-lantern today. Now, children carry plastic buckets made to look like a carved pumpkin. They fill them with candy as they trick-or-treat around their neighborhood.</p>
<p>We close with a usual conversation around Halloween in the U.S. See how many traditions and customs you can spot.</p>
<p><em>A: Are you going to any Halloween parties this year?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No, I have to take my kids trick-or-treating. Then I'm too tired to dress up and go out to a party. Are you going?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Yes, I'm going to be a vampire this year. My block has a great party with a haunted house every year.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Oh, I wish I could go. Hey, will you help me carve these pumpkins? I want to put them out front.<br/>
B: Sure, I love carving jack-o-lanterns. Can I have some of that candy while I'm working?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Of course. Help yourself to those fun-sized Hershey bars. I only have a hundred of them.</em></p>
<p>Does your culture have any celebrations where you dress up or give out treats? Write to us in the comments to tell us about them!</p>
<p>And that's Everyday Grammar for Halloween. Boo!</p>

            <title>AI Tool Aims to Predict Virus Variants before They Appear  (2023/10/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 October 2023</span><br/>
<p>Scientists have created an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that aims to predict different virus versions, called variants, before they appear.</p>
<p>Creators of the tool say it works by estimating the likelihood that a variant will permit it to escape the body's own <strong>immunity</strong> defenses.</p>
<p>The tool is called EVEscape. It works by processing collected data on the development, or evolution, of a virus over time. The system also considers detailed biological and structural information related to the virus.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (NIAID-RML via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3874-08dbd580cc27_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">

<p>The method is a form of "generative AI," a term describing technology tools designed to operate at human levels. EVEscape was developed by researchers from Britain's University of Oxford and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. The team's findings recently appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06617-0">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>Many viruses repeatedly <strong>mutate</strong> in an effort to stay alive and strong. This requires viruses to infect living organisms. Once inside the body, viruses continue to reproduce and spread.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html">explains</a> that repeated mutating creates new variants. Some of these mutations permit the virus "to spread more easily or make it resistant to treatments or vaccines," the CDC said.</p>
<p>The researchers built on previous work involving a tool they created called EVE. This tool was designed to study gene mutations that can cause human disease. In a past study, the team said it successfully used EVE to identify mutations linked to conditions like cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientists said they recognized a good chance to "rebuild" EVE into a new tool "for the purpose of predicting viral variants."</p>
<p>To do this, the team <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/ai-tool-can-help-forecast-viral-outbreaks">explained</a> it "turned the clock back to January 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic started." The researchers asked the EVEscape tool to predict what mutations would develop from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The researchers reported the tool correctly predicted which SARS-CoV-2 mutations would appear and which would become most common, or dominant.</p>
<p>The team also <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/ai-tool-can-help-forecast-viral-outbreaks">said</a> the tool predicted which antibody-based treatments "would lose their efficacy as the pandemic progressed and the virus developed mutations to escape these treatments."</p>
<p>The study noted EVEscape can make predictions more quickly and effectively than lab-based methods. This is because the tool does not need "to wait for <strong>relevant</strong> antibodies to arise in the population and become available for testing."</p>
<p>The team said the system was able to examine tens of thousands of new virus variants appearing each week and identified the ones most likely to become problematic.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurev is a student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technoology (MIT). She was a leader of the research. Gurev said that by quickly identifying the threat level of new variants, "we can help inform earlier public health decisions."</p>
<p>The team said it continuously uses the system to examine real-time data about the development of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. It then shares this information with the public and international agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The researchers said their experiments also showed the EVEscape tool could successfully predict mutating behaviors for other common viruses, including HIV and the flu.</p>
<p>Debora Marks is a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School's Blavatnik Institute. She was a lead writer of the study. She said the researchers would continue to improve the tool's ability to predict new variants for a number of viruses. "Because if we can, that's going to be extremely important for designing vaccines and <strong>therapies</strong>."</p>

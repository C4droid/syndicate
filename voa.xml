        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Some Community Colleges Offer Free College Credit for High Schoolers  (2023/8/27)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Kara Baker recently graduated from high school in the state of Indiana. She earned more than a high school <strong>diploma</strong>, however. She also completed a two-year <strong>associate degree</strong> at the local community college, Ivy Tech.</p>
<p>This summer, Baker is taking more classes at Ivy Tech before beginning her studies at Purdue University, also in Indiana. She hopes to become a <strong>veterinarian</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE --Terre Haute Campus, Ivy Tech Community College (Courtesy photo, Ivy Tech Community College)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a1b3-08db92a3706c_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE --Terre Haute Campus, Ivy Tech Community College (Courtesy photo, Ivy Tech Community College)</span></div>
<p>In many areas in the U.S., students can earn college credit at community colleges while they are still in high school. Many of these programs are called dual-credit programs.</p>
<p>And in recent years, some community colleges have begun offering <strong>courses</strong> to high schoolers at no cost during the summer.</p>
<p>Programs like these aim to get more students to enter community college and to help them finish programs they have already started.</p>
<p>The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center provides reporting on issues in education. It said <strong>enrollment</strong> at community colleges has decreased by nearly 40 percent over the past 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Free summer programs for high school students</strong></p>
<p>Baker said she was looking for programs to help her recover time lost in her education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ivy Tech was the answer.</p>
<p>"I felt very behind <strong>due to</strong> Covid," Baker says. "[High] school slowed down, but my online college classes continued on. I was so grateful."</p>
<p>With 43 <strong>campuses</strong> across the state of Indiana, Ivy Tech has the most students of any community college system in the U.S.</p>
<p>During the 2019-2020 school year, there were over 63,000 Indiana high school students in Ivy Tech's dual-credit program. But the COVID-19 pandemic made it more difficult for some students to finish the program.</p>
<p>As a result, Ivy Tech began its "Crossing the Finish Line" program in summer of 2021. The program lets high school students who are close to finishing their studies at Ivy Tech take their remaining classes at no cost during the summer.</p>
<p>The program saw completion of 714 programs of study in summer of 2021, and an additional 900 during the 2021-22 school year. Students paid for any courses they had to finish during the fall or spring.</p>
<p>The results of the Crossing the Finish Line program were good. So, in 2022, Ivy Tech began offering free college credit courses in summer to high school students, even if they were not in a dual-credit program. Any student from grades nine through 12 who meets the requirements may take the summer classes.</p>
<p>In the U.S., students from grades 9-12 are usually between 14 and 18 years old.</p>
<p>Including both the Crossing the Finish Line and other free summer courses, this year nearly 8,000 Indiana high schoolers are taking free college classes at Ivy Tech.</p>
<p><strong>Saving money and time</strong></p>
<p>Officials at Ivy Tech said the free classes have saved students and their families about 6.5 million dollars this summer. A three-credit class at Ivy Tech usually costs students about $510.</p>
<p>The Indiana Department of Education pays for the Crossing the Finish Line program, while Ivy Tech is spending about 3.6 million dollars to pay for other summer classes.</p>
<p>Baker told VOA Learning English that the college classes might save her up to two years of college credit as she works towards becoming a veterinarian. For her, the college credit she received means less money spent on student loans.</p>
<p>"As I look at future student loans, I am grateful for the opportunities Ivy Tech presented," she said.</p>
<p>Seeing students finish their programs and continue in higher education makes the cost worth it, said Monica Marianna Hingst. She is Interim Vice President for K-14 and Strategic Initiatives at Ivy Tech.</p>
<p>"Getting students to come here and take courses for free is great. It's even better when it's aligned toward a completion, because once you earn that certification, or once you earn that degree, you are now setting yourself up for success."</p>
<p><strong>Northern Virginia Community College</strong></p>
<p>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) is one of the largest community college systems in the U.S. Its JumpStart2NOVA program permits students who finish high school in the spring to take college courses for free during the summer. NOVA started the program in 2020 to help students continue their education during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In addition to classes, students receive free online help with their studies. They can also attend free weekly information sessions on how to succeed in their education.</p>
<p>There are about 700 students in the program this year. JumpStart2NOVA helps both the students, the community college, and the local community, said Dr. Eun-Woo Chang, Chief Academic Officer at NOVA.</p>
<p>He noted that having more students finish their programs of study helps provide skilled workers for the local economy.</p>
<p>"It's a good investment to make them to stay at NOVA and also Northern Virginia, so this helps the regional economy here."</p>
<p>He added, "Community colleges are in the community that needs a lot more resources...they are underserved. We are here for them."</p>
<p>Chemeketa Community College is in the state of Oregon. Its BOLT program offers 12 different five-week college credit courses for free for up to 450 students in the summer. The students must be entering or finishing their last year of high school. Like the program at Ivy Tech in Indiana, the BOLT program also pays for the cost of textbooks.</p>
<p>Chemeketa designed the BOLT program because Covid-19 affected the schools in the area. The program supports students who have fewer chances to take college courses for credit.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for college</strong></p>
<p>Back in Indiana, Kara Baker adds that Ivy Tech has helped her with more than time and money.</p>
<p>"Ivy Tech took my learning and thinking to that next level. I feel I am better prepared to manage the college experience," she said.</p>
<p>Baker added, "I felt I was driven more as a student, as I saw a more diverse future outlook compared to my fellow high school students."</p>

            <title>What Does 'On a Shoestring' Mean?  (2023/8/27)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">26 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give you definitions, examples, and notes on usage. Sometimes we even use them in conversations.</p>
<p>Today we talk about a common object. Shoestrings are very useful for keeping our shoes on. But they are also useful for describing a situation where money is <strong>tight</strong>, meaning there is not much of it.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A woman ties up her shoestrings on her sneakers. (Adobe stock image)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-362b-08dba4f2575c_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpeg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A woman ties up her shoestrings on her sneakers. (Adobe stock image)</span></div>
<p>A budget is the amount of money available for some purpose. So, if you are <u>on a shoestring budget</u>, you do not have a lot of money. You have just enough <u>to get by</u>. If you can <u>get by</u> on very little money, you are able to live on a shoestring. Sometimes we shorten this expression and just say "on a shoestring."</p>
<p>We have other ways of describing this situation. For example, you might say you are <u>living paycheck-to-paycheck</u>. This means you get your paycheck but by the time your next one comes, you have used all your money to pay your bills.</p>
<p>Living paycheck-to-paycheck can also be called <u>living hand-to-mouth</u>. The money goes right into your hand and then you must buy the most <strong>basic</strong> of <strong>necessities</strong> – food. You do not have money to spend on extras. Everything you <strong>earn</strong> goes to pay for your immediate needs – things like, food, shelter, medicine, and transportation.</p>
<p>But now let's go back to our shoestrings. You can do a lot of things "on a shoestring."</p>
<p>For example, if you can <u>travel on a shoestring</u>, you travel very <strong>cheaply</strong>. You do not spend money on costly hotels. You look for good deals. You might use <strong>coupons</strong>, <strong>discount </strong>offers or other ways to save money. And you may plan to travel at less costly times. People who travel on a shoestring are often called <u>budget travelers</u>.</p>
<p>I learned how to travel on a shoestring when I studied in China. As a student, I did not have much money. So I traveled everywhere by train and stayed at universities. Traveling on a shoestring let me go to many more places.</p>
<p>But how did shoestring come to describe a tight budget – one with little money? Well, some word experts say it comes from people who sold small items on the streets. These items often included shoestrings.</p>
<p>Now let's hear two friends use this expression.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, I hear you're going on vacation next week. Where are you off to?</em></p>
<p><em>B: First, I'm going to Paris and then heading to Barcelona. Finally I'll finish up my trip in Milan. </em></p>
<p><em>A: That is some trip! You must have saved up for a long time to have enough money for that kind of travel budget. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Not at all! I am an expert at <u>traveling anywhere on a shoestring</u>. In Paris, I'm staying with friends. In Barcelona, I found a cheap<strong> dorm room</strong> at a university. And in Milan, I'm working on a farm in exchange for a free room and meals. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Wow, you are REALLY good at shoestring travel. By not spending a lot of money on hotels, you're able to go to more places. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Exactly!</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and This Stories.</em></p>
<p>Are you learning English on a shoestring? If so, keep listening to VOA Learning English. Our high-quality content is free!</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Medicinal Earthworms Sought in Vietnam to Fill Chinese Demand  (2023/8/27)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>China is facing a continuing decrease in its supply of earthworms used for medicine. Hunters in Vietnam are attempting to catch the animals to meet Chinese demand.</p>
<p>Chinese traditional medicine uses earthworms to treat several conditions, including fever, arthritis and lung problems. But overhunting has made it difficult to keep harvesting the animals in China.</p>
<p>This has led hunters in Vietnam to dig up earthworms to sell to Chinese companies. However, Vietnamese farmers depend on the animals to keep their fields fertile and the environment balanced. The earthworm harvesting, mainly in northern areas of the country, is hurting farming operations.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Earthworms are being dried for use in Chinese medicine." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-97d3-08db99aeeac7_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Earthworms are being dried for use in Chinese medicine.</span></div>
<p>Chinese buyers are offering a lot of money for earthworms, Vietnam's <em>VnExpress</em> recently reported. The harvests are taking place unlawfully at private fields and fruit farms, the news service said.</p>
<p>The hunts have led orange farmers in Hoa Binh province to carry out 24-hour guard operations to stop the <strong>poachers</strong>, Vietnam's <em>VTC News</em> reported. The farmers have asked Vietnamese agriculture officials for help. VOA's Vietnamese service contacted the country's Agriculture Ministry for comment, but did not receive an answer.</p>
<p>Catching earthworms is "easy money" for poachers, the <em>Vietnamnet</em> newspaper reported, with each kilogram of wet earthworms bringing in between $3 to $3.30. Some poachers can capture up to 100 to 120 kilograms of earthworms per night, earning hundreds of dollars, <em>Vietnamnet</em> said.</p>
<p>Hunters use electric signals to drive earthworms up to the surface. The animals are then processed before being sold to Chinese sellers, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The harvesting activities have led to an "<strong>extinction</strong>-level ecological disaster" in China. Poachers who now face police enforcement in China are looking to Vietnam for earthworms.</p>
<p>Biologist Nguyen Lan Hung is a professor at Hanoi's National University of Education and chief of Vietnam's Association for Biological Sciences. He told VOA the usefulness of earthworms has a long history in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>"During the anti-French independence war, our soldiers used to eat earthworms to treat malaria," Hung said. He noted that they are now used to make heart and brain drugs. Hung suggested setting up legal farming of earthworms to prevent poaching. The country already has experience raising worms used for breaking down substances in soil.</p>
<p>Vo Tong Xuan is an agronomist who is also president of Vietnam's Nam Can Tho University. Both Xuan and Hung warned that the collection process damages the quality of the soil, crops and overall agriculture environment. Without earthworms, soil can become hard and roots find it difficult to draw in water, Xuan said. This can harm plant growth and also cause flooding.</p>
<p>Xuan said he would like Vietnam to criminalize the gathering of earthworms with electricity. For now, poachers are only detained and released after police seize their devices and captures, <em>VTC News</em> reported.</p>
<p>The earthworm is not the only in-demand product in China that has been sought in Vietnam. In the past, this has included buffalo hooves, <strong>leeches</strong> and nut products for use in traditional medicine. Those efforts also caused environmental damage in Vietnam.</p>

<p>
VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about William Howard Taft, who took office in 1909.</p>
<p>In some ways, the story of Taft's presidency is also a story about <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-theodore-roosevelt/3986653.html" target="_blank">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s presidency. Roosevelt had been president for the eight years before Taft. The two men were friends; Roosevelt was even a <strong>mentor</strong> to Taft.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - William Howard Taft" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/a40e80e0-d613-407f-b1ab-22281965da8c_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - William Howard Taft</span></div>
<p>But the two men were very different. Roosevelt was energetic, both in his physical abilities and in his use of executive power. His vision for the country was progressive.</p>
<p>In <strong>contrast</strong>, Taft was a more conservative, heavy man who fell asleep in meetings, and who did not make decisions quickly.</p>
<p>In fact, Americans often remember Taft because of his size. His weight changed frequently, but as president Taft usually weighed about 135 kilograms.</p>
<p>One popular story claims that Taft got stuck in a White House bathtub. This story is not true. However, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/why-william-howard-taft-was-probably-never-stuck-in-his-bathtub/">it is true</a> that Taft had a special bathtub made for him. Several men could sit comfortably in it.</p>
<p>As president, Taft did continue some of Roosevelt's reforms, but in a more orderly way. He also took some actions that <strong>contradicted </strong>Roosevelt's wishes.</p>
<p>In four years, the two men had gone from political allies to competitors for the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Taft was another president who was born in the state of Ohio. He grew up in the city of Cincinnati, along with five siblings.</p>
<p>Taft's father was a well-known lawyer, public official and diplomat. He was an advisor to President <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-ulysses-grant/3920036.html" target="_blank">Ulysses Grant</a>.</p>
<p>His mother was an intelligent, independent woman who also worked for the public good.</p>
<p>The Tafts had high expectations for their son. He became an excellent student, who went on to study at Yale and then the University of Cincinnati Law School.</p>
<p>Taft sought a career path that he hoped would lead him one day to the U.S. Supreme Court. He worked as a lawyer, and then as a judge in Ohio. Along the way, he met Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt helped Taft <strong>advance</strong> his career as a judge.</p>
<p>But one person was not happy about the career move: Taft's wife.</p>
<p>Taft had married an intelligent, independent woman named Helen Herron, known as Nellie. She had always wanted to be first lady, and she urged her husband to follow a path toward the White House.</p>
<p>In time, Nellie Taft had her wish. In 1900 President William McKinley offered Taft a position in the Philippines. The islands had come under the control of the United States after the Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>McKinley wanted Taft to help prepare the Philippines to be ruled by civilians, instead of by soldiers. Taft worried he would not like the job; however, he knew that it was a good chance to build a political career.</p>
<p>Taft was right about that. But he was wrong about disliking the job. He enjoyed it so much that he turned down two offers to return to the U.S. and serve on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, Taft successfully established courts, schools, a transportation <strong>network</strong>, and a health care system.</p>
<p>Taft did have <strong>pejorative</strong> views about the people who lived there – he did not think they were yet capable of governing themselves. But he performed his job as governor general effectively.</p>
<p>Taft might have even stayed in the Philippines if it were not for his friend Theodore Roosevelt. In 1901, Roosevelt became president. He asked Taft to become his secretary of war.</p>
<p>Taft agreed, partly so he could continue to supervise the Philippines. But the job also put him in a position to become president himself.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>William Taft did not really want to be president. But Theodore Roosevelt and Nellie Taft wanted him to be.</p>
<p>During the election of 1908, Taft permitted Roosevelt to do most of the campaigning for him. He spent a lot of time golfing. Taft was the first president to be strongly linked – so to speak – to the sport of golfing. (Another word for golf course is "links.")</p>
<p>Yet voters approved of Taft. They likely hoped he would continue the reforms of Roosevelt. He won the election easily.</p>
<p>Once in the White House, however, Taft did several things that <strong>reversed</strong> Roosevelt's positions.</p>
<p>First, Taft signed a bill that did not reduce <strong>tariffs</strong> as much as many <strong>progressive</strong> activists wanted.</p>
<p>Then, Taft removed one of Roosevelt's friends from a goverment position. Taft believed he was correct in making the move, but Roosevelt and many other Republicans were furious.</p>
<p>Some <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/williamhowardtaft">historians</a> say they did not give Taft enough credit for the many reforms he did make. His government pursued a large number of anti-trust suits against big business.</p>
<p>It also advanced two Constitutional amendments – one to establish a federal income tax, and another to permit voters to elect senators directly.</p>
<p>As the end of Taft's term in the White House came near, the Republican Party was divided. At their 1912 convention, a majority of delegates nominated Taft for president again. But a number left the meeting in anger. They created a new group, called the Progressive Party, and nominated as their candidate Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Taft and Roosevelt, along with the Democratic Party candidate, fought a bitter campaign during 1912. Of the three, Taft came in last.</p>
<p>Roosevelt came in second.</p>
<p>The divided Republicans had given control of the White House to the Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Happily for him, Taft's story does not end there.</p>
<p>Taft taught at Yale University Law School for a while. Then, when a Republican took the White House again, President Warren Harding appointed Taft as chief justice of the Supreme Court. He is the only person to lead both the executive and judicial branches of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Taft was clear about which one he favored: He was much more <strong>comfortable</strong> as a justice than he was as president.</p>
<p>One journalist at the time <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/chief-justice-not-president-was-william-howard-tafts-dream-job-180961279/">described</a> Chief Justice Taft as "a smiling Buddha, placid, wise, gentle, sweet."</p>
<p>He even lost weight.</p>

<p>Lenin Tamayo is named after the leader of the Russian Revolution, Vladimir Lenin. But he wants to revolutionize Peruvian popular music.</p>
<p>Tamayo aims to create popular music similar to South Korean K-pop songs, but he is using Quechua, the language of the Incas.</p>
<p>The Incas were the people who ruled western South America before the arrival of Spanish explorers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Peruvian singer Lenin Tamayo poses for a photo while taking a break from recording a music video in downtown Lima, Peru, Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-3126-08dba0173032_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Peruvian singer Lenin Tamayo poses for a photo while taking a break from recording a music video in downtown Lima, Peru, Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia)</span></div>
<p>Tamayo grew up speaking Quechua at his home in Lima.</p>
<p>His music mixes beats from Korean songs with <strong>folklore</strong> from the Andes Mountain area and traditional Peruvian sounds. It appears to be popular. Tamayo has received at least 4 million "hearts" on the video social media service TikTok.</p>
<p>Twenty-three-year-old Tamayo is not so concerned with how many people listen on social media. Instead, he hopes to bring attention to discrimination and the importance of Peru's past and those he claims as his ancestors.</p>
<p>He told Reuters: "My music had to <strong>embrace</strong> my <strong>origins</strong> strongly."</p>
<p>The young singer observed that the voice was very important to the people of the Andes, calling it a "<strong>primordial</strong> sound." And he added "the voice goes hand in hand with the language," noting that Quechua is what will define his sound.</p>
<p>Quechua is spoken by about 10 million people in South America. It is the most widely used native language there. It is spoken not only in Peru but also in parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador.</p>
<p>In school, Tamayo began listening to Korean popular music, or K-pop, which started being popularized internationally by the group BTS about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Study of Korean culture became a way for the young singer to make like-minded friends and to deal with <strong>bullying</strong> that he said he faced because of his appearance.</p>
<p>Tamayo told Reuters that he saw young girls listening to K-pop and watching Korean TV dramas. By trying to make friends, he thought he could get closer to Korean culture, he said.</p>
<p>The result is a musical mixture that people on the internet have called "Q-pop."</p>
<p>Tamayo's first album, <em>Amaru</em>, was released this month. Each song is based on Incan <strong>mythology</strong>. Ideas include Kay Pacha, or the living world; Uku Pacha, or the world of the dead; and Hanan Pacha, the heavenly kingdom. On stage, Tamayo dances and looks like a Korean male performer. But the sound of the music is based on traditional instruments from the Peruvian mountains.</p>
<p>Fans who recently attended a Lenin Tamayo performance were happy to take <strong>selfies</strong> and talk about the new artist. Gabriel Castro spoke to Reuters about it. He said the new music "helps raise awareness among all our people, all our new generations and the older ones too, who are part of Peru."</p>

<p>An <strong>exhibition</strong> of war stories and artwork from children in Ukraine recently opened in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The event is being held in Amsterdam, where Anne Frank wrote her famous World War II <strong>diaries</strong> as she hid her family from <strong>Nazi</strong> occupiers.</p>
<p>The exhibition, called "War Diaries," shows the experiences of children caught in the war in Ukraine. The conflict began when Russian forces invaded the country in February 2022.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A drawing by Mykola Kostenko is part of the War Diaries exhibition, showcasing the personal diaries of Ukrainian children who have witnessed the war, hosted by the Amsterdam city hall , Netherlands, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2023.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong)</span></div>
<p>Khrystyna Khranovska developed the idea for the show. She said it is meant to describe the pains of war "through the children's eyes." Khranovska added, "It strikes into the very heart of every adult to be aware of the suffering and <strong>grief</strong> that the Russian war has brought our children."</p>
<p>The exhibition includes notes like those written by Anne Frank in the Amsterdam home where she hid with her family from the Nazis during World War II. The show shares the stories Ukrainian children have faced during the war, as told in writings, photos and video.</p>
<p>Among those taking part was Mykola Kostenko. The boy, who is now 15, spent 21 days surrounded by Russian forces in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Kostenko created drawings with pen and paper torn from notebooks. One of them showed the small <strong>basement </strong>where he and his family sheltered from Russian forces before they fled the city.</p>
<p>Kostenko told the Associated Press, "I put my <strong>soul</strong> into all of these pictures because this is what I lived through in Mariupol. What I saw, what I heard. So, this is my experience, and this is my hope."</p>
<p>Katya Taylor is a curator for the exhibition, meaning she helps collect the materials included in the show. She said she thinks the diaries and artwork are useful tools for helping the children deal with the harmful effects of war.</p>
<p>Kostenko said drawing and painting helped calm him and provided a healing effect. "It also was an instrument to save the emotions that I lived through. For me to remember them in the future because it's important," he added.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials have estimated that more than 500 children have been killed during the war. In addition, the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, estimates about 1.5 million Ukrainian children are at risk of depression, <strong>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> and other mental health problems.</p>
<p>The youngest diarist was 10-year-old Yehor Kravtsov, who also lived in Mariupol. In writing appearing next to the diary, he describes his dream of becoming a builder. But he said his experience living through the war changed his mind.</p>
<p>Kravtsov wrote, "When we got out from the basement during the occupation ... I was very hungry, I decided to become a chef to feed the whole world."</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "persons" and "people."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Persons vs. People" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-9c2e-08dba40cfcf6_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Persons vs. People</span></div>
<p>My name is Richard. I am from Uruguay. I would like to ask you about the differences between "persons" and "people."</p>
<p>I learned that I have to use "people" as a plural of "person," however I saw that in English sometimes they write "persons" as a plural instead of "people."</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Richard.</p>
<p>This is a great question. Both words are the plural form of "person," but we use them in different situations. Let's explore each word further.</p>
<p><strong>Persons</strong></p>
<p>A "person" is a noun meaning an individual human. "Person" is in the singular form.</p>
<p>In English, we do have a plural form of that word, which is "persons." Although we do not use it much in everyday speech, the word "persons" is often used in law, especially when talking about "missing persons" or "persons of interest."</p>
<p><em>Police said they are seeking three persons of interest possibly in connection with the robbery.</em></p>
<p><strong>People and Peoples</strong></p>
<p>Most often, we use the word "people" to mean multiple or a group of humans. It is the most common plural form of "person." The word is a countable noun. And, although "people" is defined as many humans, it is not a collective noun. Collective nouns describe many individuals who form a group.</p>
<p><em>There were 50 people picking apples at the <strong>orchard</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Susan enjoys being around a lot of people.</em></p>
<p>We often use the word "people" when talking about one <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/descent-vs-ancestry-/7229681.html">ethnic</a> group or nationality.</p>
<p><em>The Ukrainian people celebrate their independence day on August 24th.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you may see "peoples," with an "s." We use "peoples" when we are talking about different ethnic groups in the same area.</p>
<p><em>The peoples of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/how-to-eat-dumplings-in-georgia/7047660.html">Caucasus</a> are spread over six countries and include more than 50 ethnic groups.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Richard.</p>

            <title>Study Suggests Links Between Fracking, Health in Children  (2023/8/25)</title>

<p>Three new studies suggest links between natural gas wells and cases of cancer, asthma and birth problems.</p>
<p>Children who lived closer to natural gas wells in heavily-<strong>drilled</strong> western Pennsylvania were more likely to develop lymphoma, a rare cancer, researchers found. Nearby <strong>residents</strong> of all ages had an increased chance of severe asthma, a lung disease, and low birth weight.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh did the studies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Work continues at a shale gas well drilling site in St. Mary's, Pa., March 12, 2020.(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-6236-08db9e996445_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Work continues at a shale gas well drilling site in St. Mary's, Pa., March 12, 2020.(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File)</span></div>
<p>The researchers found what they called strong connections between the gas industry activity called fracking and two health problems: asthma, and lymphoma in children. Lymphoma is a type of cancer less common among children.</p>
<p>The researchers were unable to say whether the drilling caused the health problems. The studies were not designed to do that. Instead, the researchers looked at health records to try to find out possible connections based on how close people lived to natural gas wells.</p>
<p>Gas industry groups say the studies had weaknesses, and had limited data.</p>
<p>In the cancer study, researchers found that children who lived within 1.6 kilometers of a gas well had five to seven times the chance of developing lymphoma compared with children who lived 8 kilometers or farther from a well. That is equal to about 60 to 84 lymphoma cases per million children living near wells. For kids living farther away, the number is 12 per million.</p>
<p>The researchers found that people with asthma who lived near wells were more likely to have severe reactions. However, researchers said they found no clear connection for severe reactions during periods when crews were building, drilling and fracking the well. Fracking is the process of putting liquid into the ground to <strong>extract</strong> natural gas.</p>
<p>The four-year, $2.5 million research project is coming to an end. It was established under pressure from the families of childhood cancer patients who live in the nation's largest natural gas <strong>reservoir</strong> in western Pennsylvania. A very rare form of bone cancer had been found in <strong>dozens </strong>of children and young adults in a heavily drilled area outside the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But the researchers said they found no connection between gas drilling and childhood leukemia, brain and bone cancers.</p>
<p>The researchers said their findings on early births and low birth weights among families living closer to gas wells were similar to the mixed results of similar studies. But it said babies born to mothers near active wells in production were about 28 grams lighter on average.</p>
<p>Edward Ketyer is a retired child doctor who sat on a board for the study. He said he expected that the studies would be similar to other research showing the "closer you live to fracking activity, the increased risk you have of being sick with a <strong>variety </strong>of <strong>illnesses</strong>."</p>
<p>A number of states have strengthened laws around fracking and waste <strong>disposal</strong> over the past 10 years. However, researchers have said that it is still unclear how much <strong>toxic</strong> substances<strong> </strong>the industry puts into the air, injects into the ground or produces as waste.</p>
<p>Large-scale fracking the past 20 years has made the United States into a worldwide oil and gas superpower.</p>
<p>But it also brought many protests about water and air pollution, as well as diseases, in states including Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Iran and Saudi Arabia are among six countries set to join the BRICS economic group next year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia are the others to become members in 2024.<br/>
伊朗和沙特阿拉伯将于明年加入金砖国家经济组织。其它国家还包括阿拉伯联合酋长国、阿根廷、埃及和埃塞俄比亚。</p>
<p>BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Brazil, Russia, India and China formed the group in 2009 to increase economic cooperation among growing economies. South Africa joined in 2010.<br/>
金砖国家代表巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非。巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国于2009年成立了该组织，以加强增长中经济体之间的经济合作。南非于2010年加入。</p>
<p>The group has called for more representation of developing countries and those in the south in world affairs. The group announced the addition of new members Thursday at its meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa.<br/>
该组织呼吁增加发展中国家和南方国家在世界事务中的代表性。该组织星期四在南非约翰内斯堡举行的会议上宣布增加新成员。</p>
<p>BRICS currently represents around 40 percent of the world's population and more than 25 percent of the world's economic output. That is set to increase with the new members, which include three of the world's biggest oil producers in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran.<br/>
金砖国家目前约占世界人口的40%，以及世界经济产出的25%以上。这一数字将随着新成员的加入而增加，新成员包括沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋和伊朗这三个世界上最大的石油生产国。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing world<br/>
不断变化的世界</span></p>
<p>BRICS nations have long called for reforms of organizations like the U.N. Security Council, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They say the current structures "reflect yesterday's world."<br/>
金砖国家长期以来一直呼吁改革联合国安理会、国际货币基金组织和世界银行等组织。他们说，目前的结构“反映的是旧世界”。</p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is the host of the BRICS meeting this year. He said the expansion is an "effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous."<br/>
南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨是今年金砖国家会议的东道主。他说，这次扩建是“为了建设一个公平、公正、包容和繁荣的世界”。</p>
<p>In a sign of BRICS' growing influence, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also attended Thursday's expansion announcement. He said that international organizations "must reform to reflect today's power and economic realities."<br/>
联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯也出席了周四的扩大声明，这表明金砖国家的影响力正在增强。他说，国际组织“必须进行改革，以反映当今的权力和经济现实。”</p>
<p>China's President Xi Jinping called the expansion "historic." He added that the group wanted "unity and development."<br/>
中国国家主席习近平称此次扩张是“历史性的”。 他还表示，该组织希望“团结和发展”。</p>
<p>However, some observers have questioned whether the group will become anti-Western with the expansion. China's relationship with the United States is at a low point. Russia faces Western economic measures for its invasion of Ukraine.<br/>
然而，一些观察家质疑该组织是否会随着扩张而变得反西方。中国与美国的关系正处于低谷。俄罗斯因入侵乌克兰而面临西方的经济制裁。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New members cheer the announcement<br/>
新成员为这一宣布欢呼</span></p>
<p>Mohammad Jamshidi is the top political aide of Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi. He called the decision to add his country a "victory for Iran's foreign policy."<br/>
穆罕默德·贾姆希迪是伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱西的高级政治助理。他称接纳伊朗的决定是“伊朗外交政策的胜利”。</p>
<p>China and Russia were supporting Iran's inclusion. However, Brazil, India and South Africa, which have strong ties with the U.S., only gave their approval more recently.<br/>
中国和俄罗斯支持伊朗的加入。然而，与美国关系密切的巴西、印度和南非最近才批准。</p>
<p>UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan welcomed the BRICS announcement. He said his nation would be joining an "important group" and would work with all nations and people around the world.<br/>
阿联酋领导人谢赫·穆罕默德·本·扎耶德·阿勒纳哈扬对金砖国家的声明表示欢迎。他说，阿联酋将加入一个“重要团体”，并将与世界各地的所有国家和人民合作。</p>
<p>Egypt President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in a statement that his country would work to "raise the voice of the Global South."<br/>
埃及总统阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西在一份声明中表示，埃及将努力“提高全球南方的声音”。</p>
<p>The expansion also helps Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country and one of the fastest-growing economies on the continent. Its government is working to reconnect with international partners and financial organizations after a violent two-year conflict in the country's Tigray area.<br/>
这一扩张也有助于埃塞俄比亚，该国是非洲第二人口大国，也是非洲大陆增长最快的经济体之一。在该国提格雷地区发生了为期两年的暴力冲突后，该国政府正在努力与国际合作伙伴和金融组织重新建立联系。</p>
<p>South African officials say more than 40 countries have said they want to join BRICS. And 22 countries have officially asked to join the organization.<br/>
南非官员说，已有40多个国家表示希望加入金砖国家。已经有22个国家正式要求加入该组织。</p>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">24 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Intelligence officials from the United States and Western countries believe that an explosion brought down the plane <strong>presumed</strong> to carry Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and others.</p>
<p>One of the officials told the Associated Press that the explosion was in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's "long history of trying to silence his critics." The official was not permitted to comment publicly and did not want to be named.</p>
<p>Russian officials have not officially confirmed the identity of those who died on the private plane. However, President Putin expressed sympathy on Thursday to the families of those who were reportedly on the plane. He also spoke of Prigozhin, saying, "He made some serious mistakes in life, but he also <strong>achieved</strong> necessary results."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Russian serviceman inspects a part of a crashed private jet near the village of Kuzhenkino, Tver region, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023.

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he did not know what happened, but he said, "I'm not surprised." He added, "There's not much that happens in Russia that Putin is not behind."</p>
<p><strong>The mutiny</strong></p>
<p>Prigozhin founded the Wagner group. It is an organization of fighters based in St. Petersburg who offer their services for money and are not officially linked to the Russian military. The fighters were known to support military leaders in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>They had also been supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. But Prigozhin criticized Putin and his military leaders and launched what was called a <strong>mutiny</strong> earlier this year.</p>
<p>On June 23 and 24, he and his soldiers moved against Russia's leaders, shooting down aircraft and started a <strong>convoy</strong> of military vehicles targeting Moscow.</p>
<p>The anti-Putin move ended when the two men reached a deal that permitted Prigozhin to go to Belarus. Reports, however, said he was able to move safely and freely between Russia, Belarus and parts of Africa. He appeared at a meeting between Russia and African nations in St. Petersburg in July.</p>
<p>Many wondered why Prigozhin seemed safe after moving against Putin. Other opponents of the Russian president had been sickened, killed or imprisoned in the past.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, rescue workers found 10 bodies, which included members of the Wagner group and the airplane crew.</p>
<p>Russian media reports said Prigozhin was on the plane, <strong>citing</strong> unnamed people. The lights on the group's main building in St. Petersburg were lit in the shape of a cross overnight. By Thursday, supporters made a small memorial with red and white flowers and Wagner Group flags.</p>
<p>There was no official statement from Russia's leaders on the crash or its cause. However, Rosaviatsia, Russia's aviation agency, published a list of those on board and it included Prigozhin.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Reuters news agency went to the place of the crash on Thursday and spoke to people who said they heard a loud sound before seeing the airplane fall to the ground.</p>
<p>One person, Anatoly, said he heard "a metallic bang" and not the kind of noise from a thunderstorm. Part of the plane's tail and other wreckage were seen on the ground.</p>
<p>Flight information services showed the plane flying normally until it disappeared from radar.</p>
<p>Prigozhin supporters called him "a hero" on messaging services. They said the flight had either been shot down by a missile or destroyed by a bomb on board. Those claims have not been <strong>verified</strong>, and Russian officials say they are investigating the crash.</p>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">24 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Cleaning is one of those activities that we have to do. But what kinds of words and structures do we use to talk about this common activity?</p>
<p>In today's<em> Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore a few ways to talk about cleaning. This lesson builds on the ideas of a recent lesson that explored verbs and objects.</p>
<p>Today we will explore phrasal verbs that connect to cleaning.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-08ed-08dba4b87241_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar</span></div>
<p><strong>Phrasal verbs </strong></p>
<p>Phrasal verbs are groups of words. They include a verb and another short word or words. Together, these groups of words take on a different meaning from what the individual words suggest.</p>
<p>There are many phrasal verbs in English. But we only use a small number of these when we talk about cleaning.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will explore three phrasal verbs that connect with cleaning. All of them involve the short word "up."</p>
<p>The phrasal verbs are "clean up," "pick up," and "wash up." Let's explore each of these in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Clean up </strong></p>
<p>"Clean up" has a few closely related meanings. It means to remove dirt or waste. It also means to make a room clean and orderly.</p>
<p>"Clean up" comes in a few different forms. Sometimes we use clean up without a noun or noun<strong> phrase</strong> after it, as in:</p>
<p><em>"Let's take some time to clean up."</em></p>
<p>But we often use a noun or noun phrase with clean up, as in "clean up something."</p>
<p>So, you might say:</p>
<p><em>"I need to clean up the kitchen."</em></p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p><em>"He needs to clean up his room."</em></p>
<p>In our example, the noun phrases "the kitchen" and "his room" come after the phrasal verb.</p>
<p>But you should know that sometimes we use the noun or noun phrase in between "clean" and the short word "up," as in "clean something up."</p>
<p>So, you might hear a person say:</p>
<p><em>"She needs to clean this mess up."</em></p>
<p>You might be worried about these two forms – the one in which the noun or noun phrase comes in the middle of the phrasal verb and the one in which the noun or noun phrase comes after it.</p>
<p>The good news is that your meaning will still be understood<strong> regardless </strong>of which form you choose.</p>
<p>In other words, these two statements have the same basic meaning in most situations:</p>
<p><em>"She needs to clean this mess up."</em></p>
<p>And,</p>
<p><em>"She needs to clean up this mess."</em></p>
<p><strong>Pick up </strong></p>
<p>Our second phrasal verb is "pick up." "Pick up" has a few different meanings in different situations. But when we are talking about cleaning, we use it to mean the action of lifting something from the floor, ground, or other low surface.</p>
<p>Once again, we use "pick up" with a noun or noun phrase. And just like "clean up," "pick up" can have the noun phrase come after the phrasal verb or in the middle of the phrasal verb.</p>
<p>So, you might hear a person say:</p>
<p><em>"Could you pick up those toys?"</em></p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p><em>"Could you pick those toys up?"</em></p>
<p>Once again, the two forms have the same meaning although the grammar — the noun phrase placement — is a little different.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Imagine a situation in which a little baby has thrown some toys on the ground. A person might say:</p>
<p><em>"I will pick up the toys."</em></p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p><em>"I will pick the toys up."</em></p>
<p><strong>Wash up </strong></p>
<p>Our final phrasal verb is "wash up."</p>
<p>When we talk about cleaning, we generally use "wash up" in the sense of washing your hands, face, or dishes.</p>
<p>So, you might hear a person say:</p>
<p><em>"I need to wash up before we go to the concert."</em></p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p><em>"We need to wash up the dishes before we go to bed."</em></p>
<p><strong>The ending is important </strong></p>
<p>An important point about phrasal verbs. The short word at the end of the phrasal verb <strong>determines</strong> the meaning. So, by paying careful attention to the short word or words, you will improve your ability to use the correct phrasal verb at the right time.</p>
<p>That is why we chose to use phrasal verbs only with "up" for this lesson. Now, whenever you talk about cleaning, you will remember that you can use several phrasal verbs that end in "up," - clean up, pick up, and wash up.</p>

            <title>Media Companies Seek New Rules to Protect Content from AI Training  (2023/8/24)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/media-companies-seek-new-rules-to-protect-content-from-ai-training.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Major media organizations are calling for new laws to protect their content from use by trainers of artificial intelligence (AI) tools.</p>
<p>The request for new laws, or regulations, was contained in an open letter released earlier this month. The leaders of several large news and publishing organizations signed the document.</p>
<p>They include officials of the Associated Press<em> </em>(AP), Gannett and the News Media Alliance, which represents hundreds of media publishers. Representatives from Getty Images, the National Press Photographers Association and Agence France-Presse also signed the document.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The OpenAI logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from ChatGPT, March 21, 2023, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a122-08db9f786a5d_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The OpenAI logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from ChatGPT, March 21, 2023, in Boston.

<p>The organizations stated their support for the "responsible" development and deployment of AI systems. One AI tool, known as a "chatbot," has demonstrated the ability to produce human-quality writing based on short, written commands. Such tools are also known as "generative AI" or "large language models."</p>
<p>But the letter also expresses the need to develop regulations "to protect the content that powers" the increasing number of AI tools in development.</p>
<p>Media companies are worried about AI developers using their published content without permission. The media content enjoys <strong>copyright</strong> protections and the companies want governments to enact rules to restrict unapproved use of their material.</p>
<p>AI developers need huge amounts of data to train systems that aim to produce human-level results. Developers often collect this data from publicly available websites in a process called "scraping."</p>
<p>The letter states that the process of scraping gives AI developers free use of their media content. They can then use this data to create language models that strengthen their AI tools and businesses.</p>
<p>A few media companies have already signed <strong>licensing</strong> agreements with AI developers to give them permission to scrape their content. Last month, the Associated Press completed a deal with chatbot developer OpenAI to license the news agency's large news story collection.</p>
<p>Other news organizations have taken steps designed to block developers from collecting their content. The <em>New York Times</em>, for example, recently changed its "Terms of Service" agreement to include new guidelines for AI.</p>
<p>The new policy requires AI developers to have written permission to use any of its content to train language models. The policy covers different forms of content, including written text, images and audio and video material.</p>
<p>The open letter also describes another big problem with chatbots and other AI tools: the production of false or misleading information presented as truth. It calls on AI developers to build into their systems tools to prevent such falsehoods.</p>
<p>News and media content created by AI tools "can <strong>distort</strong> facts and leave the public with no basis to <strong>discern</strong> what is true and what is made up," the letter states. It adds that many language models can also produce results that include long-standing biases against minority and underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>Many news companies are currently experimenting with generative AI tools. They hope to learn how the tools can best serve the news production process. Several major news organizations <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/news-organizations-team-up-with-ai-companies/7198889.html">announced</a> last month they had teamed up with AI developers to find new tools to help reporters do their work.</p>
<p>The AP recently issued new guidelines for the use of AI tools across all departments at the news agency. The guidelines ban the use of such tools "to create publishable content and images for the news service," the AP said in a story about its new rules.</p>
<p>However, the news agency said that it is also urging its employees to study the technology to learn how its use might improve their work within the rules.</p>

<p>Many years after the famous <strong>mummy</strong> Oetzi was discovered in the Italian Alps, scientists have studied his DNA again.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the ancient hunter mostly had ancestors who were farmers in an area that is in present day Turkey. Oetzi had less hair on his head and darker skin than scientists had first thought, says the study.</p>
<p>The study appeared recently in the publication Cell Genomics.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This photo provided by The South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology shows Oetzi the Iceman, one of the oldest human glacier mummies.

<p>Oetzi, who lived more than 5,000 years ago, was frozen into the ice after someone shot him with an <strong>arrow</strong>. In 1991, German visitors to the area found his body, along with some of his clothing and tools.</p>
<p>Oetzi's belongings included a copper <strong>ax</strong>, a <strong>longbow</strong> and a bearskin hat. The remains are housed at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy.</p>
<p>Researchers published a study of Oetzi's genetic material, or genome, in 2012. However, the study of ancient DNA improved in the years that followed.</p>
<p>So, scientists decided to investigate the mummy's genes again, said study writer Johannes Krause of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Researchers used DNA taken from Oetzi's hip bone.</p>
<p>The new genome is "providing deeper <strong>insights</strong> into the history of this mummy," said Andreas Keller of Germany's Saarland University. Keller worked on the earlier study but was not involved with the latest.</p>
<p>Based on the new genome, Oetzi's appearance when he died around age 45 was much like the mummy looks today. It is dark and does not have much hair on it, said study writer Albert Zink of the Institute for Mummy Studies at Eurac Research in Italy. Scientists previously thought the iceman was lighter-skinned and hairier in life, but that his mummified body had changed over time.</p>
<p>His genome also showed he had an increased chance of the diseases obesity and diabetes, the researchers reported.</p>
<p>Oetzi's ancestry suggests that he lived among an <strong>isolated</strong> population in the Alps, Zink said. Most Europeans today have a mix of genes from three groups: farmers from Anatolia, hunter-gatherers from the west and <strong>herders</strong> from the east. However, 92 percent of Oetzi's ancestry was from just the Anatolian farmers.</p>

<p>Ian Happ is a professional baseball player for the Chicago Cubs of Major Leagues Baseball in the United States. When he first started playing with the team in 2017, he was looking for pictures to hang in his home.</p>
<p>From that simple desire came an idea and an unlikely partnership with a British artist.</p>
<p>Happ wanted art that showed Wrigley Field, the Cubs ballpark, from a different viewpoint.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The works of British artist Pat Vale titled See What I See, Pat Vale With Ian Happ. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-986c-08dba255b705_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The works of British artist Pat Vale titled "See What I See, Pat Vale With Ian Happ." (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)</span></div>
<p>Happ said that many fans have been to Wrigley but have never seen what the ballpark looks like from the field. He thought looking up from the field was "such a <strong>cool</strong> experience" that he wanted to "bring that to more Cubs fans."</p>
<p>He hired the British artist Patrick Vale to create three large drawings of Wrigley from his point of view five years ago.</p>
<p>Instead of having pictures to hang in his home, the partnership led to something quite different.</p>
<p>Happ's view of Wrigley Field became the <em>Through My Eyes </em>project, in which fans can purchase prints. The money goes toward Happ's <strong>charity</strong>. The drawings by Vale became <em>See What I See</em>, an <strong>exhibit</strong> at Chicago's Gallery Victor. The show is open through August 26.</p>
<p>All this started with Happ simply looking for artwork.</p>
<p>A college <strong>teammate</strong> at the University of Cincinnati had become an <strong>architect</strong> in New York. That teammate gave Happ the names of several artists. One was Vale.</p>
<p>Happ noticed the level of detail in Vale's drawings of cities. After talking with Vale, Happ got the idea to bring Vale to Chicago and draw Wrigley Field from a viewpoint few fans get to experience. The drawings would be from a player's point of view looking out onto the field and into the <strong>stands</strong> of the famous ballpark.</p>
<p>Happ brought Vale to Chicago in September of 2018 and showed him around Wrigley. Vale knew little about the sport of baseball. But he understood the connection fans have with Wrigley.</p>
<p>"I understand when people talk about baseball and their connections to family and family stories and childhood," said Vale, who lives in New York. "It's the same for me with cricket. I can remember summers in the garden with grandpa and listening to the radio."</p>
<p>Happ had to explain to Vale the importance of the 400 feet sign in center field and the famous <strong>manual</strong> scoreboard and <strong>ivy</strong>. He had to teach him the correct positioning of the players. Happ also explained what it feels like standing in the field under the bright lights with a loud crowd.</p>
<p>Vale took pictures and used them to help him create drawings in great detail. He would send rough drawings to Happ, who would mark them up in red ink, like a teacher, with suggestions.</p>
<p>The drawings are mostly in black and white. They show everything from the faces of the fans and the people selling drinks to the numbers and pictures on the video screen. They show a celebration from the view of someone looking down the left-field line. And there is the view from the <strong>dugout</strong> looking toward third base and right field as the pitcher throws with the bright lights shining.</p>
<p>"He was talking about very specific moments," Vale said of Happ. "The scoreboard needs to feel like the scoreboard, right? I had to respect it and the place."</p>

            <title>Japan to Release Wastewater from Fukushima Nuclear Plant  (2023/8/23)</title>

<p>Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, signed off Tuesday on his country's plan to release treated and <strong>diluted</strong> radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant later this week.</p>
<p>If weather and sea conditions are good, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, will start to release the water into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday.</p>
<p>The water release is an important part of the process of cleaning up the plant, which was damaged by a disastrous earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. A tsunami is a large ocean wave created by the movement of the land under the ocean.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Workers are seen near storage tanks for radioactive water at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan.

<p>The wave destroyed the power center's cooling systems and caused three of the plant's nuclear reactors to overheat, or meltdown. The result was <strong>contaminated</strong> cooling water that has been treated and stored for over 10 years.</p>
<p>The prime minister said everything has been done to ensure the plan's safety and to protect Japan's fishing industry. He said the government will continue to explain the plan's science until the cleanup is completed many decades from now. A decade is a period of 10 years.</p>
<p>Kishida said, "The government will take responsibility until the disposal of the...treated water is completed."</p>
<p>The government of South Korea said it understands the plan and it will hold Japan to its promises to supervise the safety of the water. South Korea agreed to support Japan's plan even with protests by lawmakers and activists.</p>
<p>Other East Asian nations, however, are not pleased with the plan to release the water. China said it will increase radiation testing on fish imported from Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese fishing organizations protested the plan partly because they are worried about being able to sell their catch.</p>
<p>But TEPCO says about 1,000 storage tanks which have held the contaminated water since the disaster of 2011 are now almost full. The company is also concerned about possible leaks. So, the treated water must be released.</p>
<p>Junichi Matsumoto is the TEPCO leader in charge of the water release. In an interview with the Associated Press last month, he said the release is "a <strong>milestone</strong>" but there is still a lot of work to do to close down the plant.</p>
<p>TEPCO will start by releasing 7,800 tons of water over the first 17 days. All of it will be diluted with seawater to reach safe levels of radiation. By March 2024, TEPCO plans to release over 31,000 tons of water. However, that equals only 10 of the 1,000 storage tanks. The speed of the release will increase over time.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in July that Japan's release plan will have almost no effect on human health or the environment.</p>
<p>Rafael Grossi is the director general of the IAEA. He said the United Nations office at the plant will remain open to <strong>monitor </strong>the water as it is released.</p>
<p>Most scientists agree with the IAEA, but they said the slow release of radioactive water, even at very low levels, needs attention.</p>
<p>Japan's government is continuing to explain the plan in nearby countries so that the release does not damage diplomatic communication. TEPCO is also considering accepting responsibility for the financial losses of the Japanese seafood industry because of restrictions placed on its products by other countries and extra testing requirements by China.</p>

<p>Srettha Thavisin is Thailand's new prime minister after winning a parliamentary vote Tuesday.</p>
<p>He is the wealthy leader of one of Thailand's best-known property companies. He was elected prime minister just nine months after joining Pheu Thai, a political party known for supporting the poor.</p>
<p>Parliament confirmed the 61-year-old Srettha, ending months of political uncertainty following May elections. He will lead the Pheu Thai party's push to improve the economy and lessen inequality.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pheu Thai's prime ministerial candidate Srettha Thavisin who is the sole candidate nominated for a parliamentary vote, speaks to media at the party headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2023.

<p>Pheu Thai finished second to the Move Forward Party in the May elections. But the party was able to group together an 11-party coalition, including two pro-military parties, to approve Srettha.</p>
<p>"I will perform my duties to the best of my ability. I will work tirelessly to improve the <strong>livelihood</strong> of all Thais," Srettha told reporters at Pheu Thai's headquarters.</p>
<p>Hours before Tuesday's parliamentary vote, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former Prime Minister and founder of Pheu Thai, returned to Thailand after 15 years in <strong>exile</strong><strong>. </strong>Supporters greeted Thaksin who then began serving an eight-year prison sentence on corruption charges.</p>
<p>Thaksin, who was ousted by the military in 2006, dismissed the charges as being influenced by politics. Observers believe that Srettha's appointment was related to Thaksin's return and that it might help shorten his jail time.</p>
<p><strong>Political newcomer</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Srettha stepped down as head of his family's company, Sansiri. Sansiri is one of Thailand's largest developers with property worth over $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>Srettha was born into a wealthy family. And some thought he would not be able to connect with Pheu Thai's main voters in the country's poorer, rural north. But after joining the party, he appeared at many campaign events targeting the working class.</p>
<p>Before starting his political career, Srettha was a major critic of the outgoing Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. Prayuth was an army leader who led the <strong>coup</strong> against another Pheu Thai government led by Thaksin's sister Yingluck in 2014.</p>
<p>Srettha was among many opposition politicians, thought leaders and activists questioned by Prayuth's military government shortly after the coup.</p>
<p>He wrote many online posts accusing Prayuth and his government of <strong>mishandling</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic. Srettha earned support during student-led protests demanding democratic reforms in 2020.</p>
<p>Srettha became an adviser for Pheu Thai's economic team to promote the party's policies. That includes a plan to give 10,000 baht, about $290, in digital money to all Thais age 16 and above.</p>
<p><strong>Thaskin's controversial return</strong></p>
<p>Thaksin is still loved and hated in equal measure in Thailand. Hundreds of his supporters gathered at the airport, the court and outside the prison to greet his return. They wore red shirts, carried signs and chanted "PM Thaksin."</p>
<p>Thaksin was a former policeman who started a successful business selling computers. As prime minister, he won the hearts and votes of millions of Thais in rural areas with giveaways like money, loans, farm support and healthcare.</p>
<p>But his huge popularity and support for new <strong>capitalism</strong> put him in conflict with the military, businesses, and royal supporters. It started a political battle that is still being played out today.</p>

            <title>Early Literacy: Vocabulary  (2023/8/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/early-literacy-vocabulary.mp3"/>

<span class="datetime">22 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>The words we use to speak, write, and read are called our vocabulary. We need a strong vocabulary to share ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for vocabulary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An English teacher should <strong>focus</strong> heavily on building vocabulary. When you teach your students new words, use strategies and activities that allow them to draw, read, write, and repeat new words as much as possible.</li>
<li>Use examples <strong>suited</strong> to the age of your students. If you teach the word "happy" to younger students, your example might be, "My friend gave me a toy. I felt happy." But you probably would not use that example with an older student. In that case, an example might be, "My job makes me happy."</li>
<li>Create a sentence frame for the students to use. Sentence frames help students use a word quickly and in a complete thought. They are ready-made sentences. Sentence frames for the word "happy" could be:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>"I feel happy when ______."</em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Vocabulary" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-32e9-08db93831514_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Vocabulary</span></div>
<p><em>"_______ makes me happy."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>visual</strong> aids and appeal to all your students' senses. When you teach a new word, show a picture. If you teach the word<em> "</em>bug," show or bring in a bug! If you teach the word "happy," show them happiness. Have them act it out. Use the senses often.</li>
<li>Once you teach a new word, use it often. The more students use a new word, the more likely they are to learn and remember it.</li>
<li>Use vocabulary across subject matter. Include words you use in other classes like math and science. Students are more likely to learn a word if they use it in different situations.</li>
<li>Finish the new word lesson with a question or quick activity. You could ask, "What do people look like when they are happy? Can you show me?" Then have each student show happiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies for vocabulary</strong></p>
<p><u>Strategy: First Teach Important Words and Ideas</u></p>
<p>Before reading a story, your students should understand the words and ideas in the story. Make a vocabulary list of key words in the text. Post the list in the classroom. Say the words with students. Talk about the meanings. Also explain any new ideas in the story.</p>
<p><u>Strategy: Active Read-Aloud </u></p>
<p>This strategy can be used for vocabulary and comprehension.</p>
<p>When reading aloud to your class, ask questions about a new or important word. Let students answer in their home language or English. Correct or add to the students' answers.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>TEACHER: "What does it mean to hate somebody?</em></p>
<p><em>STUDENT: "You do not like them."</em></p>
<p><em>TEACHER: "Yes. But a little or a lot?"</em></p>
<p><em>STUDENT: "A lot. You do not like them a lot."</em></p>
<p>Explain the meaning of the word. Give a definition, related words, and examples. Use your face, objects, pictures, or physical movements to show word meanings while they read aloud.</p>
<p><u>Strategy: Word Map</u></p>
<p>A Word Map is like a picture. It organizes information in a visual<strong> </strong>way. Word Maps help students to think about new words in different ways.</p>
<p>On the board or on paper, write the new word in the middle of the map. Tell the students to think about the word. Then they fill in the rest of the map with a definition, sentences using the word, related words, unrelated words, and pictures to explain the word. Do this as a whole class or in small groups.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for vocabulary</strong></p>
<p>Assessing, or testing, vocabulary in your students is very important. Here are some ways to assess vocabulary of early and advanced learners.</p>
<p><u>Match words with visuals </u></p>
<p>This type of assessment is very helpful for early learners and learners with a very low English level. Choose the target words —the words you want to test. Then, collect or draw pictures to go with each word. You can also use objects. Say the word and then have the student choose the correct picture or object.</p>
<p><u>Interviews</u></p>
<p>Chose the target words and ask the student questions:</p>
<p>- Can you use this word in a sentence?</p>
<p>- What word in your language means the same thing?</p>
<p>- Use your face and body to show the word's meaning.</p>
<p><u>In their own words (Summarize)</u></p>
<p>Give students a short text to read. Make sure the text has target vocabulary. Students then can show their understanding of the vocabulary by re-telling, describing, or explaining the text. You can also ask students to talk about a character or favorite part of the story using the target vocabulary.</p>
<p><u>Role-plays</u></p>
<p>Role-plays are a form of acting. Give students a text to read and have them act it out. More advanced students can write a play using the target vocabulary. Students can play the role of the teacher and review vocabulary with the class.</p>
<p>Use these tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve you and your learners. Change them to fit your students and teaching situation.</p>

<p>India will soon attempt to land a spacecraft on the point farthest south on the moon, its south pole.</p>
<p>The attempt comes just days after the failure of a Russian moon lander. India's space agency on Monday released images its spacecraft captured on the far side of the moon. That is the part of the moon that cannot be seen from Earth.</p>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched the spacecraft called the Chandrayaan-3. ISRO had been in a race with Russia to be the first national space agency to land on the <strong>lunar</strong> south pole. The area is thought to hold water ice that could support a future moon settlement.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This handout picture provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) shows the surface of the moon taken by Moon Impact Probe.

<p>As news of the failure of Russia's Luna-25 mission spread on Sunday, ISRO said that Chandrayaan-3 was set to land on August 23.</p>
<p>The mission is India's second attempt to land on the south pole of the moon. In 2019, ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully launched an orbiter, but its lander crashed. Chandrayaan means "moon vehicle" in Hindi and Sanskrit</p>
<p>The ground at the lunar south pole is uneven making landing there difficult. A first landing would be historic. The area's water ice could supply fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions.</p>
<p>Images released on Monday showed <strong>craters</strong> on the moon's surface captured by the spacecraft's camera. The camera is designed to help identify a safe landing place for the spacecraft.</p>
<p>India's moon mission launched on July 14. The Chandrayaan-3's lander separated from the rest of the spacecraft last week.</p>
<p>For India, a successful moon landing would mark its arrival as a world space power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government aims to increase investment in private space launches and related satellite-based businesses.</p>
<p>Manish Purohit is a former ISRO scientist. "If Chandrayaan-3 succeeds, it will <strong>boost</strong> India's space agency's <strong>reputation</strong> worldwide," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Russia's Luna-25 crashes</strong></p>
<p>Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft crashed into the moon after it went into an uncontrolled orbit, the country's Roscosmos space agency said Sunday. The pilotless spacecraft had been expected to land Monday.</p>
<p>However, Roscosmos said it lost contact with the Luna-25 on Saturday after the spacecraft reported problems.</p>
<p>Vitaly Egorov is a popular Russian space expert. He said the mission had some successes although it crashed.</p>
<p>"Luna 25 showed important progress. It flew toward the Moon, carried out orbit correction, and tested <strong>onboard</strong> electronics and scientific tools," he said. "Russian <strong>cosmonautics</strong> was not at this level before. But then, an error occurred somehow."</p>
<p>The lunar mission was Russia's first since 1976, when it was known as the Soviet Union. Only three governments have successfully landed on the moon: the Soviet Union, the United States and China.</p>
<p>Scientists at ISRO have said they learned from the earlier moon mission's failure and made changes to Chandrayaan-3. They said a successful landing is now more likely. The changes include making it possible to land safely anywhere within a larger landing area in difficult conditions. It also holds more fuel, carries additional <strong>solar panels</strong> and has stronger legs.</p>

            <title>New COVID-19 Vaccine to Launch in September  (2023/8/22) | 美国新版新冠疫苗将于9月面市</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/new-covid-19-vaccine-to-launch-in-september.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The latest COVID-19 vaccine is set for release in September. But health experts say it remains unclear how many Americans will choose to get the new shot.<br/>
最新的新冠肺炎疫苗将于今年9月发布。但卫生专家表示，目前尚不清楚有多少美国人会选择接种新疫苗。</p>
<p>The efforts to prepare a new vaccine come as hospitals in the United States report increases in COVID-19 patients since early July. But the number of hospitalizations is still far below those reported earlier this year and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>
新疫苗的开发工作正值美国医院报告自7月初以来新冠肺炎患者增加之际。但住院人数仍远低于今年早些时候和整个新冠肺炎大流行期间报告的人数。</p>
<p>A drop in infections has caused demand for the vaccine to fall sharply since the first shot became available in 2021. Officials say that overall, more than 240 million people in the U.S. had received at least one COVID-19 injection. That number represents about 73 percent of America's population.<br/>
感染人数下降导致对疫苗的需求自2021年第一针疫苗问世以来的急剧下降。官员们表示，总体而言，美国有超过2.4亿人至少接种了一针新冠肺炎疫苗。这个数字约占美国人口的73%。</p>
<p>By autumn of 2022, fewer than 50 million people got the vaccine shots. By that time, most people in the U.S. had either been infected with COVID-19 or had received at least one shot.<br/>
到了2022年秋季，只有不到5000万人接种了疫苗。那时，大多数美国人要么感染了新冠肺炎，要么至少接种了一针。</p>
<p>Public health experts have advised people to look at COVID-19 vaccines the same as they do shots for other sicknesses, such as the flu. Flu vaccines are developed to fight the latest virus versions, called variants, and are generally administered once per flu season.<br/>
公共卫生专家建议人们像接种流感等其他疾病的疫苗一样，接种新冠肺炎疫苗。流感疫苗的开发是为了对抗最新版本的病毒，也就是所谓变种，通常每个流感季节都要接种一次。</p>
<p>But efforts to get people to seek COVID-19 shots are likely to be hurt by decreasing concern about the virus. Some people also question if the vaccines are safe.<br/>
但让人们接种新冠肺炎疫苗的努力可能会因为人们对该病毒的担忧减少而受到损害。一些人还质疑疫苗是否安全。</p>
<p>Healthcare providers and drug businesses have said they plan to start offering the new COVID-19 vaccine next month. The vaccine was developed to fight virus versions linked to the Omicron variant, which has been spreading in the U.S. since last year.<br/>
医疗保健提供商和制药企业表示，他们计划下个月开始提供新的新冠肺炎疫苗。该疫苗是为了对抗与奥密克戎变异株有关的病毒版本而开发的，奥密克龙变异株自去年以来一直在美国传播。</p>
<p>Ashley Kirzinger is a lead researcher with the Kaiser Family Foundation. She told Reuters news agency that health officials need to send a clear message to the public that COVID-19 has not gone away. In addition, the messaging should note the new vaccine can protect individuals from serious sickness and hospitalization.<br/>
阿什利·科齐格是凯撒家族基金会的首席研究员。她告诉路透社，卫生官员需要向公众发出一个明确的信息，即新冠肺炎尚未消失。此外，该信息还应该指出，新疫苗可以保护个人避免重症和住院治疗。</p>
<p>Kirzinger noted her foundation has carried out public opinion studies on the issue. She said the top reason vaccinated people gave for rejecting more vaccinations was the belief that people were protected from the virus because of earlier shots or infections.<br/>
科齐格指出，她所在的基金会已经对这个问题进行了民意调查。她说，接种过疫苗的人士拒绝接种更多疫苗的首要原因，是相信之前打过疫苗或已经感染过，不会再次感染病毒。</p>
<p>The two largest COVID-19 vaccine makers – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – have predicted far less demand this autumn for the shots. Last year, vaccine sales by Pfizer and Moderna reached a combined $56 billion worldwide. This year, experts estimate the shots will bring in $20 billion for the companies.<br/>
两家最大的新冠肺炎疫苗制造商——辉瑞生物技术公司和莫德纳公司——预计今年秋季对疫苗需求将大幅减少。去年，辉瑞和莫德纳在全球的疫苗销售额总计达到560亿美元。专家估计，疫苗今年将为这些公司带来200亿美元的收入。</p>
<p>The COVID-19 public health emergency officially ended in May. Since then, the government has handed over much of the vaccination effort to private companies. More than 1.1 million people in the United States have died from COVID, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports.<br/>
新冠肺炎突发公共卫生事件于5月正式结束。自那时以来，政府已将大部分疫苗接种工作移交给私营公司。据美国疾控预防中心报道，美国已有110多万人死于新冠肺炎。</p>
<p>The CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considering for approval the final versions of the new vaccine. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said last week she expects the shots to be launched during the third or fourth week of September.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心和美国食品药品监督管理局正在考虑批准新疫苗的最终版本。美国疾控预防中心主任曼迪·科恩上周表示，她预计疫苗将在9月的第三或第四周接种。</p>

<p>Water is required for plant life. But what happens when there is too much of a good thing?</p>
<p>That has been the case in many parts of the world this summer. Scientists say extreme rainfall happens more often now as storms form in an atmosphere made warmer by climate change.</p>
<p>Nick Goltz is head of the UConn Plant Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. He said too much water can mean dead plants in a <strong>garden</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This July 31, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a squash plant with yellow, wilted foliage — symptoms that present after both flood and drought — on Long Island in New York. (Jessica Damiano via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/51ec774b-0aee-4cad-8cbe-c88da45cefab_cx0_cy14_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This July 31, 2023, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a squash plant with yellow, wilted foliage — symptoms that present after both flood and drought — on Long Island in New York. (Jessica Damiano via AP)</span></div>
<p>Goltz explained that flooding cuts off the oxygen supply which leads to root-<strong>rot</strong> diseases. And then plants cannot pull enough water to survive. The result is yellow, weakening leaves, which would usually show a plant's need for water. But after flooding, those same signs mean that roots under water cannot <strong>function</strong> in really wet conditions.</p>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>
<p>Avoid walking on wet soil if your garden has been affected by flooding. Wait until the soil has mostly dried before looking at the damage. Adding any weight or pressure to wet soil can cause even more oxygen to be pressed out from around struggling roots.</p>
<p>A plant with just a few signs of damage may recover, but a plant that is completely weakened probably will not, Goltz said. He added that plants with strong, deep roots – like trees and yearly returning plants – have the best chances of recovery.</p>
<p>Annuals are plants that live for less than a year. Their roots are not as deep and they are at risk if flooded. Goltz advised removing annuals if they look unhealthy.</p>
<p>Plants weakened or stressed by flood water can more easily get diseases and unwanted insects. So keep an eye on them and treat problems as they come, which could be months later.</p>
<p>Broken tree branches should be removed immediately. But save any major removal of leaves and branches for when conditions improve to avoid further weakening an already stressed tree.</p>
<p><strong>Are fruits and vegetables safe to eat?</strong></p>
<p>Flooded fruits, vegetables, and other crops should be considered unsafe and not eaten.</p>
<p>Goltz said, "If the part you're eating touches the water, then it's unsafe," even if washed or cooked. That is because in addition to bacteria from standing water, runoff from nearby gardens, chemicals, and other waste could be present, Goltz added.</p>
<p>However, if your garden was flooded but the food part of the plant was not, "then it can be eaten," Goltz said. But even then, he said, it is best to wash and cook the food part.</p>
<p><strong>Repairing the soil</strong></p>
<p>After dealing with your plants' needs, turn your attention to the flooded soil, which will also need some care. Flooded soil loses nutrients and can damage the way water flows through it. Mixing in <strong>compost</strong> will help on both counts and mixing in sand will improve the way water flows through it as well.</p>
<p>If you live in an area that easily floods, there are steps you can take to avoid or lessen future damage, such as growing vegetables in higher areas or raised beds. Or you could direct water away from the plants you care about most.</p>

<p>The rights group Human Rights Watch has accused border guards in Saudi Arabia of killing Ethiopian migrants who tried to cross over into the kingdom from Yemen.</p>
<p>The group said it got its information from eyewitness reports of attacks being carried out on the migrants by border troops. It also examined images that appeared to show dead bodies and burial sites in areas where the migrants attempted to cross. Human Rights Watch said government forces sometimes fired machine guns and launched bombs in their attacks.</p>
<p>The border attacks had led to the killings of hundreds of unarmed migrants – possibly thousands – in recent years, the group <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/08/21/they-fired-us-rain/saudi-arabian-mass-killings-ethiopian-migrants-yemen-saudi">said</a> in a new report released Monday.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, Ethiopian migrants walk on the shores of Ras al-Ara, Lahj, Yemen, after disembarking from a boat, July 26, 2019.

<p>The United Nations has already questioned Saudi Arabia about its troops opening fire on migrants along its southern border with war-torn Yemen. A Saudi government official told The Associated Press the Human Rights Watch report was "<strong>unfounded</strong>" and not based on dependable information. The official did not want to be identified and did not offer specific evidence of how the information was unfounded.</p>
<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels did not answer requests for comment. The AP reports the rebels are thought to earn tens of thousands of dollars every week <strong>smuggling</strong> migrants over the border.</p>
<p>About 750,000 Ethiopians live in Saudi Arabia. As many as 450,000 of them likely entered the kingdom without permission, the International Organization for Migration reported in 2022. The two-year civil war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray area displaced tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been cooperating with Ethiopia's government to<strong> </strong>send thousands of migrants back to Ethiopia as it struggles with youth unemployment at home.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 38 Ethiopian migrants and four relatives of people who attempted to cross the border between March 2022 and June 2023. They said they saw Saudi guards shoot at migrants or launch explosives at groups.</p>
<p>The report said the group also examined over 350 videos and photographs posted to social media or gathered from other places between May 12, 2021, and July 18, 2023.</p>
<p>It also examined several hundred square kilometers of satellite imagery captured between February 2022 and July 2023. "These show dead and wounded migrants on the trails, in camps and in medical <strong>facilities</strong>..." the report said.</p>
<p>Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. But in recent months, U.N. officials have expressed concern about Saudi forces attacking migrants coming in from Yemen.</p>
<p>An Oct. 3, 2022, letter to the kingdom from the U.N. said its investigators had received concerning accusations "of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire, <strong>allegedly</strong> by Saudi security forces causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants."</p>
<p>The U.N. letter states that if migrants are captured, they are reportedly often "subjected to torture by being lined up and shot through the side of the leg to see how far the bullet will go or asked if they <strong>prefer</strong> to be shot in the hand or the leg." The letter added, "Survivors of such attacks reported having to ‘play dead' for a period of time in order to escape."</p>
<p>A letter sent by Saudi Arabia's mission to the U.N. in Geneva in March strongly denied the kingdom carries out any "systematic" killings on the border. Saudi Arabia also said the U.N. had provided "limited information" so it could not comment further on the allegations.</p>

            <title>Study: Ancient Mars May Have Had Wet, Dry Periods  (2023/8/21)</title>

<p>Researchers say they have found evidence that ancient Mars experienced both wet and dry climate cycles.</p>
<p>The new evidence is based on data collected by an exploring vehicle on Mars, called Curiosity. The explorer, or rover, is operated by the American space agency NASA.</p>
<p>Scientists say the finding suggests Mars may have once held the right conditions to support life. They describe their findings <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06220-3.epdf?sharing_token=i2Fb9ZGlSDfctEwUM0kLaNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MUvLFC2Uvf9g7xHeSIeyjdNB6oFVdpSVi3t3TJRKWUbQY0v2rYQrwlIYIorRHuBpufOk1eJV_wpOF9X83gcpAUdX1TC_q4ZMC6qXh4Iqm-O1obaJw7AzYpw5LKaUTrQ6A%3D">in a study</a> appearing this month in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mud cracks were captured in this mosaic image by Curiosity's Mastcam on June 20, 2021. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/IRAP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4bc1-08dba01b042a_cx1_cy9_cw26_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">Mud cracks were captured in this mosaic image by Curiosity's Mastcam on June 20, 2021. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/IRAP)</span></div>
<p>Today, Mars is a dusty, cold desert. But past research has shown the planet was once home to a large system of rivers and lakes. Many studies have suggested the presence of water billions of years ago may have created conditions to support life. But there has been no clear evidence Mars also experienced dry periods.</p>
<p>The Curiosity rover has been exploring Mars' huge Gale <strong>crater</strong> since 2012. The area is believed to have contained a lake at one time and has a large mountain of <strong>sediment </strong>nearly six kilometers high.</p>
<p>The researchers said that while climbing the side of the sediment mountain in 2021, Curiosity found salt remains that formed a hexagonal shape in soil that dated back nearly four billion years. The rover's instruments identified the shape as <strong>cracks</strong> in dried <strong>mud</strong>.</p>
<p>"When a lake dries up the mud cracks, and when it fills back up, the cracks heal," said William Rapin. He is a researcher at France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the lead writer of the study.</p>
<p>Rapin said when this process is repeated, the cracks position themselves in hexagons, or six-sided shapes. This hexagonal evidence suggests there were long dry periods in the Gale Crater area. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cracks-in-ancient-martian-mud-surprise-nasas-curiosity-rover-team">said</a> the evidence that rivers and lakes on ancient Mars began to dry up at times provides evidence that climate cycles repeatedly happened.</p>
<p>Rapin said the finding is "the first <strong>tangible</strong> proof" that Mars had a wet-dry climate." The researchers say having both wet and dry seasons, as we have on Earth, could have provided the right conditions for life to form on Mars.</p>
<p>Curiosity and another rover operating on Mars, Perseverance, have already identified evidence of <strong>organic</strong> compounds that could suggest the presence of past life forms.</p>
<p>But Rapin noted these building blocks need the right mix of conditions in order to support life. "In a world that's too dry, these molecules never have the (chance) to form – nor do they in a world that's too wet," he said.</p>
<p>Ashwin Vasavada is a project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cracks-in-ancient-martian-mud-surprise-nasas-curiosity-rover-team">said</a> in a statement, "Over 11 years, we've found <strong>ample</strong> evidence that ancient Mars could have supported microbial life. Now, the mission has found evidence of conditions that may have promoted the <strong>origin</strong> of life, too."</p>
<p>Such evidence would never have been found on Earth, Rapin said. This is because tectonic plates on our planet repeatedly recycle the surface, burying evidence from before the time life formed.</p>
<p>Rapin noted this means that studying Mars – which does not have tectonic plates – could help scientists solve the mystery of how life began on Earth. "It's pretty lucky of us to have a planet like Mars nearby that still holds a memory of the natural processes which may have led to life," he said.</p>

<p>Anesthesiologists work together with surgeons to make sure their patients are asleep, or sedated, before medical <strong>procedures</strong>.</p>
<p>More and more people are taking the weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Anesthesiologists say they are having trouble deciding when surgeries should take place.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Instruments sit on a table in an operating room June 15, 2023, in Jackson, Tenn.(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/17228499-a85a-47ba-95d2-7992f8048808_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Instruments sit on a table in an operating room June 15, 2023, in Jackson, Tenn.(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)</span></div>
<p>That is because the weight loss drugs cause people to hold food in their stomachs longer than usual.</p>
<p>People who still have food in their stomachs when they are put to sleep before surgery risk a <strong>complication</strong> known as a pulmonary aspiration. That is that is the term for when someone breathes some of their stomach contents into their lungs. In extreme cases, the food particles can cause infection or even death.</p>
<p>Most patients are told to not eat for about eight hours before surgery. However, the doctors say those guidelines may need to be changed for patients who are using the weight loss drugs.</p>
<p>Ion Hobai is an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He said everyone who takes the drugs should know about "such a serious sort of <strong>potential</strong> complication."</p>
<p>Komodo Health is a technology company that works in healthcare. According to its research, nearly 6 million <strong>prescriptions</strong> for the weight loss drugs were written in the first five months of 2023.</p>
<p>In June, the American Society of Anesthesiologists said patients should not take daily weight loss medications on the day of surgery. It also advised that patients should not get their weekly weight loss injection for a week before any sedation procedures.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Champeau is the head of the organization. He said the recommendation is based on experiences from anesthesiologists around the United States.</p>
<p>A group of anesthesiologists, including Hobai, said they would recommend even more time off from the drugs before surgery. In the Canadian Journal of Anesthesia, they suggested about three weeks.</p>
<p>Dr. Philip Jones is an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. After three weeks, he said, the drug should no longer be affecting the stomach. At that point, he said, "everything should go back to normal."</p>
<p>Hobai said he is finishing a study of 200 patients who were using drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy before surgery. He said his results are similar to a smaller study in Brazil that found 25 percent of patients still had food in their stomachs 10 days after stopping the drug.</p>
<p>Because of this information, the American Society of Anesthesiologists said doctors who are unsure of their patients' stomach contents should work differently. They say doctors should work as they would if they knew the patient's stomach was full.</p>
<p>Aspiration only happens one time out of every 2,000 to 3,000 operations that require sedation. But when it does happen, the patients develop a lung injury half the time. That is why the doctors are concerned.</p>
<p>One of Hobai's patients who had been taking Wegovy developed a problem that required serious care. He had not eaten for 18 hours before surgery.</p>
<p>In another case, a woman taking a small amount of Ozempic did not eat for 10 hours before surgery. She was in the middle of a procedure that had to be stopped because doctors saw food in her stomach.</p>
<p>Dr. Elisa Lund is an anesthesiologist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. She said many doctors have similar stories, as the weight loss drugs have become more common.</p>
<p>"It has <strong>exponentially</strong> increased," she said.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk is the drug company that makes Wegovy and Ozempic. The company said there was nothing in its testing that showed the drug would lead to aspiration. However, the drug-maker did say the medications can cause the stomach to empty more slowly.</p>
<p>Hobai said he is also concerned about patients going off their medications for too long. For example, the drugs are used to control the blood sugar level of patients with diabetes. If they stop taking them before surgery, they may face a different kind of health problem.</p>
<p>He said patients who are using the drugs should tell their doctors about them and discuss the risks of having surgery.</p>
<p>"If you're taking this drug and you need an operation, you will need to have some extra <strong>precautions</strong>," he said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>At her home in northern Afghanistan, a 19-year old woman draws her own image. In the drawing, she is covered by a blue <strong>burqa</strong> and is inside a cage.</p>
<p>The woman, named Khushi, is a former university student. She once attended classes in law and political science at northern Balkh province's main university.</p>
<p>However, the Taliban closed it and other learning institutions to women in December of 2022. Since then, Khushi has developed deep sadness, or depression. She now needs mental health treatment. Part of her treatment includes art <strong>therapy</strong> classes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Khushi talks to her art teacher Zaheen in an art studio in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, August 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Ali Khara)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5ac6-08db9e82448c_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Khushi talks to her art teacher Zaheen in an art studio in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, August 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Ali Khara)</span></div>
<p>She told Reuters reporters, "When I realized that I am not mentally well, I got sad ... I was not happy at all. I was always depressed, I felt like a bird being stuck in a cage, one who has lost all her happiness."</p>
<p>Khushi, who is identified by only one name for security reasons, added, "After the Taliban banned girls from universities and announced that girls can no longer continue our education, I felt so upset."</p>
<p>Over time, she said, her mental health got worse. She finally decided to see a mental health doctor, called a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Khushi's psychiatrist cannot be named for security reasons. But he told Reuters that art <strong>studios</strong> are the only places that remain for helping his patients.</p>
<p>He said, art studios "...have become the only place where girls can clear their minds, catch up with old friends, make new friends, and apart from that, they can learn art too."</p>
<p>Inside a small art studio in Balkh's capital Mazar-i-Sharif, paintings hang on the walls. Several young women, including Khushi, have gathered for a pencil drawing class. Many of them have been sent here at the recommendation of a mental health expert. The goals are to ease their loneliness and learn a new skill, as well as talk about their situations and take medication.</p>
<p>One of the former university students in the pencil drawing class said, "When I felt depressed, the doctor <strong>prescribed</strong> me to go to a place where I can calm my mind. I chose the art studio. Not only did I make good friends here, I also receive art therapy."</p>
<p>Khushi said art therapy gave her a break from her home situation. She said it also gave her a bit of hope for the future.</p>
<p>"It gives me a sense of <strong>accomplishment</strong> for having made something...overall drawing empowers me with <strong>confidence</strong>," she said. "I'm <strong>disappointed</strong> in my life, but I am not giving up, I will fight. I hope things will get better in the future."</p>
<p>Khushi now sees her psychiatrist twice a month. The doctor used to see four to five patients a day. But he said he now sees 10 to 15 patients each day. Most of them are women. The increase became especially noticeable after the Taliban banned female students from attending universities, the doctor said.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions on women</strong></p>
<p>A source told Reuters that "...since the Islamic Emirate (the Taliban administration) started ruling the country, they have <strong>imposed</strong> so many restrictions on women." This source adds that women have been banned from universities, as well as <strong>amusement parks</strong> and <strong>beauty salons</strong>.</p>
<p>Health organizations estimate half of Afghanistan's 40 million people have experienced mental struggles after many years of war. There have been few dependable studies on mental health issues in the country. But doctors and aid workers say that more women are struggling with mental health after government orders to restrict their work and education.</p>
<p>Afghan women and mental health experts say that many women are now struggling with a deep sense of hopelessness and mental health problems. This is especially true of women in cities. Those women gained openings in education and work during the 20-year presence of foreign troops and a Western-backed government.</p>
<p>The Taliban closed universities to women in December of last year. The move led to rare public protests. The decision came after the closure of most girls' high schools. Later, the Taliban ordered most female humanitarian workers not to work.</p>
<p>The orders restricting women from public life have led to strong international criticism. Western governments have said it is a main problem standing in the way of officially recognizing the Taliban's government. The Taliban government took over the area as foreign forces left two years ago.</p>
<p>The Taliban say they respect women's rights in line with their view of Islamic law and Afghan culture.</p>

            <title>Venezuela’s Lake Maracaibo Is Getting More Polluted  (2023/8/21) | 委内瑞拉马拉开波湖污染愈发严重</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/venezuela-s-lake-maracaibo-is-getting-more-polluted.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Fishermen who work on Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo say fish stocks are decreasing as pollution grows worse.<br/>
委内瑞拉马拉开波湖的渔民表示，随着污染加剧，鱼类种群正在减少。</p>
<p>Lake Maracaibo is 600 kilometers west of Venezuela's capital Caracas. It is a center of Venezuela's oil production.<br/>
马拉开波湖位于委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯以西600公里处。它是委内瑞拉的石油生产中心。</p>
<p>But environmentalists say it is becoming a polluted wasteland. They blame too much oil exploration, poor maintenance, outdated infrastructure and a lack of waste treatment systems.<br/>
但环保人士表示，这里正逐步成为一片被污染的荒地。他们归咎于石油勘探过多、维护不善、基础设施落后和缺乏废物处理系统。</p>
<p>There are thousands of kilometers of pipelines under the lake and oil leaks take place often.<br/>
湖面下有数千公里长的管道，石油泄漏经常发生。</p>
<p>The lake is fed by many rivers and streams. But it also receives wastewater from Zulia, Mérida and Trujillo states, where 5.3 million people live. Waste from the most distant state of Norte de Santander also drains into the lake.<br/>
该湖有许多河流和溪流流入。但它也容纳来自祖利亚州、梅里达州和特鲁希略州的废水，这些州有530万人居住。来自最遥远的北桑坦德州的废物也排入该湖。</p>
<p>Beltrán Briceno teaches at the University of Zulia and is head of the research laboratory in the town of Maracaibo. He said fertilizers, human waste and other chemicals flow into Lake Maracaibo. This leads to high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. These substances support the growth of cyanobacteria, which can have poisonous effects on water animals and humans. Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are linked with mass fish deaths.<br/>
贝尔特兰·布里塞诺在祖利亚大学任教，也是马拉开波镇研究实验室的负责人。他说化肥、人类排泄物和其他化学物质流入马拉开波湖。这导致氮和磷浓度高。这些物质有益于蓝藻的生长，蓝藻会对水生动物和人类产生有毒影响。蓝藻或蓝绿藻与大量鱼类死亡有关。</p>
<p>Jose Aular is a 61-year-old fisherman. He said fish do not come near the shore because of the algae. He also said the water has caused his skin to become unhealthy with a rash.<br/>
何塞·阿乌拉是一名61岁的渔民。他说，由于藻类的存在，鱼类不会靠近湖岸。他还说，湖水导致他的皮肤变得不健康，并出现皮疹。</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, Lake Maracaibo was the heart of Venezuela's oil industry. Environmentalists say the pollution worsened in the early 1930s, when a canal was dug and connected the lake with the Caribbean Sea. The project permitted large oil tankers to navigate the lake but also let seawater into the lake. This killed some freshwater life.<br/>
20世纪初，马拉开波湖是委内瑞拉石油工业的中心。环保人士说，污染在20世纪30年代初恶化，当时开凿了一条运河，将该湖与加勒比海连接起来。该项目让大型油轮得以在湖中航行，但也让海水流入湖中。这杀死了一些淡水生物。</p>
<p>Yordi Vicuna is a 33-year-old fisherman. He said that in the past, "you could go out fishing and catch 700 (kilograms) of shrimp." But now, he said, it takes fishermen several days to catch only eight kilograms of shrimp.<br/>
约迪·维库纳是一名33岁的渔民。他说，过去，“你可以出去捕鱼，一次捕到700公斤虾。”他说，但现在渔民好几天才能捕到8公斤虾。</p>
<p>Fishermen avoid using their nets because they fear they will be damaged. Crude oil covers boats and damages fishing nets and boat motors, Vicuna said.<br/>
渔民们避免使用渔网，因为他们担心渔网会被损坏。维库纳说，原油覆盖了船只，损坏了渔网和船只马达。</p>
<p>Briceno said many years of worsening pollution are being felt near the lakeshore with bad smells, oil slicks and poisonous algae.<br/>
布里塞诺说，湖岸附近多年来污染不断恶化，有臭味、浮油和有毒藻类。</p>
<p>Briceno warned, "There is no magic formula" to rescue the lake if people continue to pollute it.<br/>
布里塞诺警告说，如果人们继续污染湖泊，“没有什么神奇方法”可以拯救湖泊。</p>

<p>Doctors in New York City have <strong>transplanted</strong> a pig's organ into a brain-dead man and watched as it performed normally for over a month.</p>
<p>Brain death is a state in which a person's brain no longer carries out even its most basic activities for life.</p>
<p>The pig kidney transplant is a step toward realizing the hopes of the New York team to try the operation on living patients.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Surgeons at NYU Langone Health prepare to transplant a pig's kidney into a brain-dead man in New York on July 14, 2023.

(AP Photo/Shelby Lum)</span></div>
<p>Scientists around the country want to learn how to use animal organs to save human lives. Doctors believe bodies donated for research will help them develop the operation for patients.</p>
<p>The latest experiment was announced Wednesday by New York University Langone Health. It marks the longest time that a pig kidney has worked in a living or dead person. And the experiment is not over. Researchers will follow the kidney's performance for a second month.</p>
<p>"Is this organ really going to work like a human organ? So far, it's looking like it is," Dr. Robert Montgomery told The Associated Press. He is the director of NYU Langone's transplant <strong>institute</strong>.</p>
<p>"It looks even better than a human kidney," Montgomery said on July 14. On that day, he replaced a dead man's own kidneys with a single kidney from a genetically engineered pig. He watched the replaced pig kidney immediately start producing <strong>urine</strong>.</p>
<p>The possibility that pig kidneys might one day reduce the shortage of transplantable organs persuaded the family of Maurice "Mo" Miller to donate his body. He had died suddenly at 57 with a formerly <strong>undiagnosed </strong>brain cancer, which did not permit for usual organ donation.</p>
<p>"I struggled with it," his sister, Mary Miller-Duffy, told the AP about her decision. But he liked helping others and "I think this is what my brother would want. So, I offered my brother to them."</p>
<p>"He's going to be in the medical books, and he will live on forever," she added.</p>
<p>Attempts at successfully performing animal-to-human transplants, or xenotransplantation, have failed for many years. Often, the human <strong>immune</strong> <strong>system</strong> attacks the foreign tissue. Now researchers are using pigs genetically engineered so their organs are a better fit for human bodies.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering approval of some small but detailed studies of pig heart or kidney transplants in volunteer patients.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 patients are on the United States' transplant list.</p>
<p>The University of Maryland's Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin warns that it is not clear if a dead body reacts the same way as a live body to a pig organ. But he said the research educates the public about xenotransplantation, so "people will not be shocked."</p>
<p>Before this most recent experiment, NYU and a team from the University of Alabama at Birmingham tested a pig kidney transplant in a dead body for just two or three days. An NYU team has also tested transplanted pig hearts on donated bodies for three days of intense testing.</p>
<p>But how long should these experiments last? University of Alabama's Dr. Jayme Locke said that it is not clear. Among the moral questions is how long a family can emotionally deal with it. Because keeping a body alive after the brain has died is difficult.</p>
<p>In her own experiment, the donated body was <strong>stable</strong> enough that if the study wasn't required to end after a week, "I think we could have gone much longer, which I think offers great hope," she said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Dominic Varela</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">19 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) services - such as ChatGPT – have become a major resource for cheating in university.</p>
<p>Now, teachers are thinking of new ways to teach classes in order to stop students from cheating with AI. Teachers say they want to use AI to teach and learn in new ways. However, they need to stop students from using the technology on assignments and tests.</p>
<p>For some students, that means a return to paper tests instead of online tests. Some teachers will be requiring students to show the <strong>editing</strong> history and <strong>drafts</strong> of their work to prove their thought processes. Other teachers, though, think students have always found a way to cheat and AI is just the newest tool.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Dr. Stephanie Laggini Fiore of the Center for the Advancement of Teaching hosts a teaching circle on artificial intelligence on Wednesday, August 9, 2023, at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (AP Photo/Joe Lamberti) " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-771a-08db9d108b38_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Dr. Stephanie Laggini Fiore of the Center for the Advancement of Teaching hosts a teaching circle on artificial intelligence on Wednesday, August 9, 2023, at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<p>The recent growth in the number of AI services has raised many questions for educators. They want students to give correct answers but also know how to do the work to get to those answers. Educators say there is agreement at least on some of the most pressing <strong>challenges</strong> they face with AI use.</p>
<p>They say it is difficult to identify AI-created schoolwork. They say sometimes students are accused of using AI to cheat when they did not.</p>
<p>In some cases, the cheating is clear to see, said Timothy Main, a writing professor at Conestoga College in Canada. He told the <em>Associated Press</em>, "I had answers come in that said, ‘I am just an AI language model, I don't have an opinion on that.'"</p>
<p>Last semester, Main's writing class had 57 <strong>academic</strong> honesty cases. Half of them involved use of AI to cheat.</p>
<p>This fall, Main and his fellow professors are changing the rules for the writing course. The teachers will ask students to write more about their opinions. They also put in place strong rules against using AI.</p>
<p>College administrators have asked teachers to make the rules more clear. Many universities are letting their professors decide the rules about using AI on their own.</p>
<p>At Michigan State University, professors are given several options of statements to choose from, administrator Bill Hart-Davidson told the <em>AP</em>.</p>
<p>"Asking students questions like, ‘Tell me in three sentences what is the Krebs cycle in chemistry?' That's not going to work anymore, because ChatGPT will spit out a perfectly fine answer to that question," Hart-Davidson said. He thinks professors should word their questions differently.</p>
<p>Evidence is growing that AI services have changed how students study and find information.</p>
<p>Chegg Inc. is an online company that helps students with schoolwork. Its services have been identified in many cheating cases. On May 1, the company's leader warned that ChatGPT was hurting the business's growth. He said students who were paying for help from Chegg were now using ChatGPT for free instead.</p>
<p>The day after he spoke, the company's market value fell by almost 50 percent.</p>
<p>Bonnie MacKellar, a computer science professor at St. John's University in New York City, thinks that there is going to be a move back to paper tests. Her class already had a "<strong>plagiarism</strong> problem" she said, and she worries that new students may not learn the skills needed for more difficult classes.</p>
<p>Ronan Takizawa, a sophomore at Colorado College, has never had a computer science exam on paper. He agrees that it would make sure students learn the material.</p>
<p>However, Takizawa thinks that students are still not sure when it is alright to use AI and when such use is cheating. Other students say ChatGPT has made them afraid about being unjustly accused of cheating.</p>
<p>Arizona State University sophomore Nathan LeVang says he checks all his assignments with a tool that helps identify AI material.</p>
<p>"If it takes me 10 minutes after I write my essay to make sure everything checks out, that's fine," Levang told the <em>AP</em>, adding, "It's extra work, but I think that's the reality we live in."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program, we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give definitions, examples, and notes on usage. And sometimes we use them in conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we talk about an expression to describe something, like a home, a vehicle, or an extremely clean object. The expression is <u>spick-and-span</u>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A person cleans a counter with a spray cleaner. (Adobe)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-5905-08db9dd4043a_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpeg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A person cleans a counter with a spray cleaner. (Adobe)</span></div>
<p>Word experts are not sure where <u>spick-and-span</u> came from. But they agree that the expression was first used in <em>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</em> in 1665: "My Lady Batten walking through the dirty lane with new <u>spick-and-span</u> white shoes..."</p>
<p>If your shoes are so white and so clean, we can call them <u>spick-and-span</u>. We might even say they look <u>brand spanking new</u>.</p>
<p>If <u>spick-and-span</u> and <u>brand spanking new</u> are too long and you want to use just one word, here is a good one: <u>immaculate</u>. If something is <u>immaculate</u>, it is completely and totally clean. It is <u>spotless</u>, meaning it does not have one single imperfection,<strong> </strong>bad mark, or <strong>blemish</strong>.</p>
<p>Our living spaces as well as our appearance and our clothes can be called <u>immaculate</u>. However, <u>spick-and-span</u> is commonly used to describe spaces. And an American company even smartly named their cleaning product <em>Spic and Span</em>. That is "spic" without the letter "k."</p>
<p>As far as usage, <u>spick-and-span</u>, <u>immaculate</u>, and <u>spotless</u> can be used in any situation. <u>Brand spanking new</u> is a bit more <strong>casual</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear the expression <u>spick-and-span</u> used in a couple of examples.</p>
<p><em>After the birthday party, my house was a disaster. So, I spent hours cleaning it, and by the end of the day, it was <u>spick-and-span</u>. You couldn't even tell there had been a party!</em></p>
<p><em>My co-worker wants everything to be <u>immaculate</u>. Even if I think the office is <u>spick-and-span</u>, she will still find something else to clean. </em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Practice using the expression <u>spick-and-span</u> the next time you want to describe something very clean.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Theodore Roosevelt, the 26<sup>th</sup> president of the United States.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Theodore Roosevelt" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/b53216bd-8ac6-4d36-b797-9c1128267902_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Theodore Roosevelt</span></div>
<p>Many Americans like to call him "Teddy" Roosevelt or even "T.R." These <strong>nicknames</strong> for the president show that Roosevelt was, in general, popular with the public. He is one of the four presidents whose face can be seen on <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm">Mount Rushmore</a>, a memorial to famous U.S. leaders.</p>
<p>Historians note that Roosevelt's term in office marks the beginning of the modern presidency. In other words, he expanded the position, and used the media to connect with the public.</p>
<p>Among Americans, his public image is often linked to youth, energy, strength, courage, and playfulness. But his image has also been linked to a strong liking for military action – and for oneself.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt is also often tied to the American West, but he was born and raised on the East Coast, in New York City. His father was a wealthy businessman. His mother was from a Southern planter family that owned slaves.</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt had two sisters and a brother. His family called him by another nickname: Teedie.</p>
<p>When he was a boy, young Theodore was often sick. He had asthma, a lung condition that could make physical activity difficult.</p>
<p>So, as he got older, Roosevelt strengthened his body. For the rest of his life, he strongly believed in physical exercise and <strong>vigorous</strong> activity – what he called "the <strong>strenuous</strong> life."</p>
<p>Young Roosevelt also had hunger for learning. He studied with private tutors, traveled overseas, and studied many subjects while in college at Harvard.</p>
<p>After his college years, he studied law briefly, and then began serving in public office in New York.</p>
<p>But tragedy halted his early government service.</p>
<p>Roosevelt had married Alice Hathaway Lee, who soon became pregnant.</p>
<p>But two days after the baby was born, Roosevelt's wife died of kidney disease.</p>
<p>And, as it happened, Roosevelt's mother died on the same day, in the same house. She suffered from Bright's Disease, another disorder affecting the kidneys.</p>
<p>The future president was struck by <strong>grief</strong>. He left his baby daughter with his sister and went to the American West. There, Roosevelt lived as a cowboy – hunting, riding horses, taking part in cattle drives, and even chasing people who broke the law. The experience helped define Roosevelt's life and beliefs.</p>
<p>But after two years, he was ready to return to the East Coast. There, he married Edith Kermit Carow, a woman he had known since childhood. They settled in a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nps.gov/sahi/index.htm">house</a> on Long Island, New York and raised Roosevelt's daughter, <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Learn-About-TR/TR-Encyclopedia/Family-and-Friends/Alice-Lee-Roosevelt-Longworth.aspx">Alice</a>. He and Edith also had five other children.</p>
<p>His family supported Roosevelt's rise in Republican Party politics, including his campaign to become governor of New York.</p>
<p>But some of the party officials were not happy with Roosevelt. They did not like his independence, and they did not want him to be re-elected as governor. So, they plotted to have him nominated as U.S. vice president in the election of 1900. They believed Roosevelt would not be able to give them much trouble in that position.</p>
<p>As the Republican leaders hoped, Roosevelt and the sitting president, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-william-mckinley/3979185.html" target="_blank">William McKinley</a>, won both the popular and electoral vote in a <strong>landslide</strong>.</p>
<p>But less than a year later, McKinley was <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.history.com/news/the-assassination-of-president-william-mckinley" target="_blank">dead</a>.</p>
<p>And with that, Republican leaders found that the man they wanted to get out of their way was now the country's 26<sup>th</sup> president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency </strong></p>
<p>When he became president, Roosevelt was only 42 years old. He is still the youngest person to hold that office.</p>
<p>At first, Roosevelt promised to continue the policies of McKinley, who was, after all, the president voters had re-elected.</p>
<p>But Roosevelt quickly put his own mark on the presidency. He is known for trying to balance the needs of many groups in society, including business owners, farmers and workers.</p>
<p>Roosevelt called his program the "Square Deal." In other words, he suggested that everyone was treated fairly.</p>
<p>However, some Americans objected to Roosevelt reducing the power of big businesses. They said his use of government rules, in general, did not let market forces operate freely.</p>
<p>Roosevelt is also known for protecting the nation's wilderness areas. He set aside more than 800,000 square kilometers of land to protect nature and wildlife.</p>
<p>In his foreign policy, Roosevelt was energetic. He helped Panama win independence from Colombia in order to start building the Panama Canal. He also defended and even added to the Monroe Doctrine, an idea from the presidency of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/americas-presidents-james-monroe/3767612.html" target="_blank">James Monroe</a>.</p>
<p>Roosevelt confirmed that the United States would bar European powers from intervening in South America. And, more than that, that the U.S. would "police" the Western Hemisphere and make sure that countries honored their international <strong>obligations</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, Roosevelt believed the United States had the right and responsibility to be a world power. If diplomatic negotiations did not work, he was not afraid to threaten the use of force. He famously said, "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."</p>
<p>Voters approved of Roosevelt's actions. Or, at least they enjoyed his leadership, and his young family that played all over the White House.</p>
<p>In 1904, Roosevelt easily won the presidency <strong>in his own right</strong>. He is the first vice president who took power after the death of a sitting president to earn his own term.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Although he was permitted to seek another term as president, Roosevelt promised not to. He left the White House in 1909, still a very young man.</p>
<p>For a while, he traveled overseas. But when he returned home, he did not like the direction the new president and the Republican Party was going.</p>
<p>So Roosevelt created a new political group, called the Progressive Party – or, as some called it, the Bull Moose Party. Not surprisingly, the term "bull moose" was meant to suggest Roosevelt and his animal-like strength.</p>
<p>Although he earned many votes, Roosevelt did not win the 1912 election. Instead, he split the votes of the Republican Party, and permitted a Democrat to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's efforts were not entirely lost, however. Later presidents – including Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson – used many of his ideas for reform.</p>
<p>And, major U.S. political parties today often find <strong>lessons</strong> from Roosevelt's presidency they admire or support. Both Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George W. Bush said Theodore Roosevelt was one of their role models.</p>
<p>In the years after the 1912 election, Roosevelt remained active. He traveled, campaigned, and continued to try to influence politics from his home in New York, where he died unexpectedly in his sleep at age 60.</p>
<p>One public official <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.trgravesite.org/gravesite.html">observed</a>, "Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping, for if he had been awake, there would have been a fight."</p>

            <title>Fiction Writers Fear the Rise of AI, and See it As a Story to Tell  (2023/8/19)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/fiction-writers-fear-the-rise-of-ai-and-see-it-as-a-story-to-tell.mp3"/>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">18 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>For many book writers, artificial intelligence (AI) is a threat to their jobs and the very idea of creativity. More than 10,000 writers and others supported an open letter about the issue from the Authors Guild this summer. The letter urged AI companies not to use copyrighted work without permission or payment.</p>
<p>At the same time, AI is a story to tell, and no longer just in science <strong>fiction</strong>.</p>
<p>Helen Phillips is the writer of the upcoming book <em>HUM</em>. It tells of a wife and mother who loses her job to AI.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cover art from I Am Code: An Artificial Intelligence Speaks and Do You Remember Being Born? (Little, Brown and Company/Astra House via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-35cd-08db9e671e09_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Cover art from "I Am Code: An Artificial Intelligence Speaks" and "Do You Remember Being Born?" (Little, Brown and Company/Astra House via AP)</span></div>
<p>"I'm frightened by artificial intelligence," but also interested in it, she explained.</p>
<p>Phillips said there is a hope in AI for gaining all knowledge, the understanding of everything. But at the same time, there is an "<strong>inherent</strong> terror in being replaced by non-human intelligence."</p>
<p>Ryan Doherty is a vice president and director at Celadon Books. It recently agreed to publish Fred Lunzker's book <em>Sike</em>, featuring an AI psychiatrist, a doctor of mental health.</p>
<p>"We've been seeing more and more about AI in book proposals," Doherty said.</p>
<p>Doherty used the term zeitgeist, meaning the general ideas or spirit of a time, to describe AI.</p>
<p>"It's the zeitgeist right now. And whatever is in the cultural zeitgeist" gets into fiction, Doherty said.</p>
<p>Other AI-related books expected in the next two years include Sean Michaels' <em>Do You Remember Being Born?</em>. That story tells of a poet who agrees to work with an AI poetry company. Also upcoming is <em>In Our Likeness</em>, by Bryan Van Dyke. It tells about a government worker and a fact-checking program with the power to change facts.</p>
<p>Another novel, A.E. Osworth's <em>Awakened</em>, tells about a <strong>witch</strong> and her clash with AI.</p>
<p>And, crime fiction writer Jeffrey Siger, known for his books set in modern Greece, is working on a book touching upon AI and the metaverse.</p>
<p>Writers are also using AI to address the most human questions.</p>
<p>In Sierra Greer's <em>Annie Bot</em>, the title <strong>character</strong> is an AI mate designed for a human male. For Greer, the book was a way to explore the character's "urgent desire to please." She said the robot mate permitted the writer "to explore desire, respect, and longing in ways that felt very new and strange to me."</p>
<p>Amy Shearn's book, <em>Animal Instinct</em>, has its beginnings in the pandemic and in her personal life. She had recently divorced and began to use dating apps.</p>
<p>"It's so <strong>weird</strong> how, with apps, you start to feel as if you're going person-shopping," she said. "And I thought, wouldn't it be great if you could really pick and choose the best parts of all these people" you see and mix them together to make your <strong>ideal</strong> person?</p>
<p>"Of course," she added, "I don't think anyone actually knows what their ideal person is, because so much of what draws us to mates is the unexpected, the ways in which people surprise us."</p>
<p>Some writers are not just writing about AI. They are also openly working with it.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Stephen Marche used AI to write the short book <em>Death of An Author</em>. Simon Rich worked with Brent Katz and Josh Morgenthau for<em> I Am Code</em>, a <strong>thriller</strong> in <strong>verse </strong>that came out this month. The AI program "code-davinci-002" created the work.</p>

<p>Alaska's Mendenhall <strong>glacier</strong> is about 20 minutes by car from Juneau, the state capital. It is one of the area's most popular sites for <strong>tourists</strong>.</p>
<p>But climate change has caused the ice to melt and the glacier to retreat. That means it is losing more snow and ice than it gains. Researchers from the University of Alaska, Southeast say the Mendenhall glacier retreated about 800 meters between 2007 and 2021.</p>
<p>Mendenhall pours down from rocky land between mountains and into a lake filled with <strong>icebergs</strong>. Special signs mark the glacier's retreat, showing where the ice once stood.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="People take in the views of the Mendenhall Glacier on June 8, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska.

<p>Experts estimate that by 2050, people will not be able to see the Mendenhall glacier from the visitor center that was built for it. That is already the case at some other glacier visitor centers in Alaska.</p>
<p>The melting glacier leads to questions for the Alaskan tourism industry. Does it make sense to build visitor centers for glaciers if they will not be useful in the future? How can tourism leaders help protect the glaciers for visitors to enjoy? And should there be limits on the number of tourists to the area?</p>
<p>Local leaders, tour companies, large boat operators and the U.S. National Park Service are all considering these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Future of tourism</strong></p>
<p>Tourism is an important part of Juneau's economy. About 1.6 million <strong>cruise</strong> ship passengers are expected to stop in Juneau in 2023. That is the most ever in one year. On especially busy days, 20,000 people arrive each day to a city that has only 30,000 full-time <strong>residents</strong>.</p>
<p>Cruise ships are large boats with sleeping places that carry tourists from one place to another. Many cruises start a weeklong trip to Alaska in either Seattle, Washington, or Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>Manoj Pillai is a cruise ship worker from India. He recently got off his ship and went to see the Mendenhall glacier. "The glacier is so beautiful now," he said. But he wondered what it must have looked like 10 or 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Jennifer Dumas lives in Washington, D.C. She knows what Alaska's glaciers looked like in the past. She and her husband first visited the state and its glaciers in the 1990s. She told about seeing another glacier not too far from the Mendenhall glacier over 20 years ago. She went to Glacier Bay National Park and spent the night near the McBride glacier.</p>
<p>"Where we used to camp, where you could see the glacier. It has receded so far, you can't see the glacier anymore. So we have pictures of us in front of the glacier, that you can no longer take those pictures."</p>
<p><strong>Visitor limits</strong></p>
<p>People have many reasons to want to visit Alaska, and all the visitors help the state's economy. But in Juneau, tourism officials are questioning whether the city and surrounding areas can deal with so many visitors each year.</p>
<p>Alexandra Pierce is the city's tourism manager. She said she and others are discussing what a <strong>sustainable</strong> tourism industry should look like.</p>
<p>City leaders and major cruise lines have agreed to a daily five-ship limit for next year. As many as seven ships a day have arrived this year. But critics worry that may not do much to reduce tourist numbers because the ships themselves keep getting bigger. Some Juneau residents say they would like one day a week without ships.</p>
<p>Kerry Kirkpatrick has lived in Juneau for nearly 30 years. She said she can remember when the Mendenhall glacier was "long across the water and high above our heads." She called the glacier a national treasure. She noted that the area may not be able to keep up with all the helicopters, cruise ships and visitors that want to see Mendenhall.</p>
<p>"There's too many people on the planet wanting to do the same things," Kirkpatrick said. "You don't want to be the person who closes the door and says, you know, ‘I'm the last one in and you can't come in.' But we do have to have the ability to say, ‘No, no more.'"</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we will answer a question about the difference between "descent" and "ancestry."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Descent vs. Ancestry " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-c736-08db9fe78185_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Descent vs. Ancestry </span></div>
<p>My name is Karim. I am 53 years old, and I am from Uzbekistan. I have been learning English on my own for 3 years. Although I cannot speak yet, I like learning English, reading books and listening to your <strong>podcasts</strong>.</p>
<p>I would like to ask about the difference between "descent" and "ancestry".</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help and support!</p>
<p>Karim</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Karim! Keep up the good work learning English with us.</p>
<p>This is a great question!</p>
<p>A few months ago, I wrote about "<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/heritage-v-inheritance-/6676326.html">heritage" and "inheritance</a>."</p>
<p>These words are related to Karim's question.</p>
<p>Let's start with "descent."</p>
<p><strong>Descent</strong></p>
<p>"Descent" is a noun that means a person's family, social status, ethnicity or <strong>origin</strong>. We usually use it with an adjective that describes a person's background.</p>
<p><em>She is of Irish descent.</em></p>
<p><em>Beau's family, of Cajun descent, is from the state of Louisiana.</em></p>
<p>Another noun, "descendant" is connected to "descent." It means a person in a family line that stretches from earlier generations to the present one.</p>
<p><em>The United States' fourth president, James Madison, had no direct descendants.</em></p>
<p>Both words come from the verb "descend." To "descend" means to come from a family line or group.</p>
<p><em>There is a theory that birds descended from dinosaurs.</em></p>
<p>"Descend" also means to go or come down from a higher place.</p>
<p>Let's move onto "ancestry."</p>
<p><strong>Ancestry</strong></p>
<p>"Ancestry" is a noun that also means a person's ethnic origin or their family members from past to present.</p>
<p>For example, I am American because I was born in the United States, but my great-grandfather was from Italy.</p>
<p><em>I have Italian ancestry.</em></p>
<p>We can use the word "ancestry" as a synonym, or a word that has the same meaning, for "descent."</p>
<p><em>A recent study has shown that many people of Puerto Rico still have Taíno ancestry.</em></p>
<p>Another noun we use is "ancestor." Your "ancestors" are the people from whom you descended.</p>
<p><em>In many religions and cultures, ancestors hold a special place and are honored in ceremonies.</em></p>

<p>Russia recently launched its first moon-landing spacecraft in 47 years. The launch comes during a time of competition by major powers including the United States, China and India to discover more about the resources held on the moon.</p>
<p>Russia said that it would launch further moon missions and then explore the possibility of a joint Russian-China crewed mission and even a moon base. NASA has spoken about the possibility of moon mining and a "gold rush" - a situation in which many people go quickly to a place where something valuable has been discovered.</p>
<p>Why are major powers so interested in what is up there?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this handout from the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos on August 11, 2023, a Soyuz 2.1b rocket with the Luna-25 lander blasts off at the Vostochny cosmodrome in the Amur region.

<p><strong>The moon </strong></p>
<p>The moon is about 384,400 kilometers from our planet.</p>
<p>The current thinking is that the moon was formed when a large object crashed into earth about 4.5 billion years ago. Some of the remains from the crash came together to form the moon.</p>
<p>Temperatures are <strong>diverse</strong> on the moon. In full Sun, they rise to 127 degrees Celsius, while in darkness they drop to about minus 173 degrees Celsius. The moon's <strong>exosphere</strong> does not give protection against radiation from the Sun.</p>
<p>The first discovery of water on the moon was made in 2008 by the Indian mission Chandrayaan-1, which detected hydroxyl molecules spread across the moon's surface. The molecules were most commonly found at the poles, NASA says.</p>
<p>Water is necessary for human life and also can be a source of hydrogen and oxygen. These elements can be used for rocket fuel.</p>
<p>The moon also likely has Helium-3.</p>
<p>Helium-3 is a kind of helium that is rare on earth, but NASA reports estimates of a million tons of it on the moon.</p>
<p>Helium-3 could provide nuclear energy in a fusion reactor. But since Helium-3 is not radioactive it would not produce dangerous waste, the European Space Agency says.</p>
<p>Also present on the moon are rare earth metals. Rare earth metals are used in smartphones, computers and other special technologies. Boeing, a very large American aerospace business, says the moon may have rare earth metals including candium, yttrium and the 15 lanthanides.</p>
<p><strong>Moon mining </strong></p>
<p>But it is not entirely clear how mining on the moon would work.</p>
<p>Some sort of <strong>infrastructure</strong> would have to be established on the moon. The conditions of the moon mean robots would have to do most of the hard work, though water on the moon would allow for a long-term human presence.</p>
<p>The laws governing moon mining are unclear and full of holes.</p>
<p>The United Nations 1966 Outer Space Treaty says that no nation can claim rule over the moon. In addition, the treaty says the exploration of space should be done for the good of all countries.</p>
<p>But lawyers say it is unclear whether or not a private business could claim rule over a part of the moon.</p>
<p>"Space mining is subject to relatively little existing policy or governance," The RAND Corporation, a research group, said on its website last year.</p>
<p>The UN's 1979 Moon Agreement says that no part of the moon "shall become property of any State, international intergovernmental or non-governmental organization, national organization or non-governmental <strong>entity</strong> or of any natural person."</p>
<p>But, no major space power has approved the measure.</p>
<p>The United States in 2020 announced the Artemis Accords, named after NASA's Artemis moon program. The agreement aims to build on existing international space law by establishing "safety<strong> zones</strong>" on the moon. Russia and China have not joined in the agreement, however.</p>

<p>Defense leaders from the West African group of nations known as ECOWAS are meeting to discuss the political crisis in Niger.</p>
<p>The leaders are concerned. The military group that ousted Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum in July did not answer an ECOWAS request to stand down or face an invasion.</p>
<p>ECOWAS has 15 member countries and is based in Abuja, Nigeria.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Military personnel gesture as the ECOWAS anthem is played during a meeting of the Committee of Chiefs of Defense staff on the deployment of the ECOWAS standby force in the Republic of Niger, in Accra, Ghana.

August 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Francis Kokoroko)</span></div>
<p>Outside security experts said ECOWAS has not been able to prevent leadership takeovers in other West African nations. That includes the recent government overthrows in Burkina Faso and Mali.</p>
<p>This time, however, the group organized a "<strong>standby</strong> force" that is ready to move on the Nigerien capital of Niamey if Bazoum is not put back in place. In addition, the group put financial and travel restrictions on Niger.</p>
<p>So far, nothing has changed. Defense experts say ECOWAS is running out of ways to put pressure on the group that took power in Niger.</p>
<p>Andrew Lebovich studies northern Africa for the Clingendael Institute, a research group based in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>He said: "An intervention could <strong>backfire</strong> and damage (ECOWAS) in numerous ways. While a failure to <strong>extract</strong> major <strong>concessions</strong> from (the soldiers in control) could weaken the organization..."</p>
<p>Another group of African states, the African Union, met earlier this week to discuss whether it would support a military move by ECOWAS. The African Union includes 55 nations in Africa. The union could prevent a military action by ECOWAS if it felt that the move would <strong>destabilize </strong>Niger and nearby countries.</p>
<p>The status of who leads Niger is important to western nations, including France and the United States. Both countries have soldiers in Niger. They have been working to train and support local soldiers in their fights against Islamic militant groups. Niger had been one of the last countries in the area with a democratic government.</p>
<p>Since the military group pushed out Bazoum and took control in Niger, the U.S. and France are no longer supporting the Nigerien soldiers.</p>
<p>This makes Niger open to outside attacks. The Associated Press reports that 17 Nigerien soldiers were killed and over 20 were injured in an attack Tuesday in the Tillaberi area in the country's northwest.</p>
<p>In Niamey, locals are concerned both about a military move by ECOWAS and the effects of financial and travel restrictions. Some of the electric power – most of which comes from Nigeria – has been cut off. Restaurant owners say they cannot keep food cold. The ECOWAS restrictions include limits on who can enter and leave Niger. They are also preventing aid workers from coming in with food and supplies.</p>
<p>Louise Aubin is the coordinator in Niger for the United Nations. She is concerned that food and medical supplies inside Niger could <strong>run out</strong> because of the border restrictions. The U.N. and other aid groups said 4 million of the 25 million people in Niger needed assistance before the military takeover. They expect that number to increase.</p>

<p>The band Fallout Boy recently released a version of the song, <em>We Didn't Start the Fire. </em>The song was first released in 1989 by the singer/songwriter Billy Joel.</p>
<p>Joel's song was about notable events and people in the United States and throughout the world from the years 1948, when Joel was born, to 1989.</p>
<p>More than 30 years have passed since then. Now, Fallout Boy remade the song to include events from 1989 to 2023. Joel's song was in chronological order, meaning the events are presented in the order in which they took place. Fallout Boy's version is not chronological.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Present Tense in " didn="" fire="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4e6e-08db9e6ff67c_w268_r1.png" start="" the="" we=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Present Tense in "We Didn't Start the Fire" </span></div>
<p>Another difference between the two is Fallout Boy's remake uses more full sentences. Both songs are mainly lists of people, places and events that many Americans are likely to remember.</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore some of the different ways that the present tense is used in the song and some additional grammar points.</p>

            <title>Young Chinese Turn to Online Streaming to Earn Money  (2023/8/17)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">16 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Many young Chinese are increasingly turning to online <strong>streaming</strong> as a way to earn money while selling products for major companies.</p>
<p>The job involves livestreaming on popular social media services in China. A person leading such livestreams is known as a host. The goal is to persuade users to spend money with large <strong>brands</strong> such as Under Armor, Lancome, YSL Beauty and Hugo Boss.</p>
<p>One such streamer is 28-year-old Zhang Jinyu, a former model who studied <strong>fashion</strong> in college. She told reporters from Reuters news agency she has already completed hundreds of hours of live streams to publicize products for YSL Beauty and other brands.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A host promotes a bag during a live stream at luxury e-commerce platform ZZER in Shanghai, China July 5, 2023. (REUTERS/Xihao Jiang)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-a596-08db9e724a59_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">A host promotes a bag during a live stream at luxury e-commerce platform ZZER in Shanghai, China July 5, 2023. (REUTERS/Xihao Jiang)</span></div>
<p>Zhang's livestreams can involve her continuously speaking on camera for up to six hours. In addition, the preparation process requires her to do her hair and makeup and spend time recording sales results after her online broadcasts have ended.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Zhang is one of millions of young Chinese currently facing record youth unemployment of more than 21 percent. Livestreaming sales is one way social media users can earn money without having to get a full-time job.</p>
<p>"For livestreaming, the <strong>threshold</strong> to enter the industry is very low,” Zhang said. “I can pick up my phone and I'm livestreaming.” She noted, however, that livestream selling is now very competitive, making it difficult for newcomers to gain a following. "If you can <strong>persevere</strong>, you can get better and better,” Zhang said.</p>
<p>Zhang is not alone in her desire to make livestream hosting a career. A recent public opinion study asked more than 10,000 young people on China’s social media service Sina Weibo how they feel about the issue. More than 60 percent said they would be interested in working as an internet influencer or livestreaming host.</p>
<p>A study by China-based marketing agency iResearch found the livestreaming industry employed more than 1.2 million hosts as of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic helped lead livestreaming sales growth that brought in about $480 billion in China last year.</p>
<p>That growth led to a series of agencies being created that aim to train new hosts and connect them with established brands.</p>
<p>Zhang, for example, works with Shanghai-based agency Romomo. The company is a business partner of Buy Quickly, which helps hosts link up with major fashion-centered brands.</p>
<p>Shining Li is vice president of Romomo. She told Reuters she thinks livestreaming is currently “one of the most important methods of communication” for the international brands she works with.</p>
<p>Shi Jianing is a 28-year-old livestreaming host. She says her broadcasts are a good way for her to build lasting relationships with followers and increase sales for the brands she represents.</p>
<p>"We're like friends with the <strong>consumers</strong>," Shi said. She added, “If you can communicate with some personal <strong>affinity</strong>, that builds a kind of trust, and that relationship makes the consumer want to carry out the sale."</p>

<p>The U.S. weather agency is exploring the ocean around the Aleutian Islands aiming to map the sea floor and make discoveries about undersea life.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship, called Okeanos Explorer, is on a five-month <strong>mission</strong>. It is a former U.S. Navy ship, which has been changed to meet current needs. Civilians and members of the NOAA Corps are carrying out the mission.</p>
<p>The ship has a 48-member crew. It has technology and tools to gather information about the deep ocean and to immediately share it with researchers. The hope is that the data will be used for future research.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The NOAA Okeanos Explorer sits at a dock on Friday, June 23, 2023, in Kodiak, Alaska. (AP Photo/Joshua A.

(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)</span></div>
<p>Mission leader Shannon Hoy said that the sea floor near Alaska is full of life. She added, "You would never know that unless we were able to go down there and explore."</p>
<p>Researchers are using several kinds of sonar technology, used to map objects underwater, and two remotely operated vehicles, Deep Discoverer and Seirios. They are designed to map and collect <strong>samples</strong>. The researchers are exploring the Aleutian Trench and Gulf of Alaska, areas of water near the U.S. state of Alaska.</p>
<p>The researchers are also using cameras that can operate at depths of up to 6,000 meters. The cameras permit the researchers to document and immediately share their findings. The ship can also share live video of the dives with the public.</p>
<p>Hoy said that, in two to four weeks, the Okeanos Explorer can map as much as 50,000 square kilometers of ocean floor.</p>
<p>Hoy said the team plans to investigate some of the area's cold "seep communities." These are places where gas from under the sea floor rises through openings. Life in these places is not believed to depend on the sun for food production.</p>
<p>Hoy said the researchers are also going to study the water <strong>column</strong> to see what interesting animals they can find there.</p>
<p>Kasey Cantwell is the ship's operations chief. She said the data will help researchers and the public better understand these areas of the ocean. The information could also help make decisions about fisheries and could also identify dangers at sea and improve maps.</p>
<p>"It's really hard to care for things you don't understand, to love things you don't understand," Cantwell said.</p>
<p>The deep ocean off Alaska's Aleutian Islands is one of the least mapped places in the U.S. Modern mapping has covered just 34 percent of the sea floor off Alaska. The area includes one of America's largest coastal <strong>ecosystems</strong>, and only a small part of that has been seen, the mission's web site says.</p>
<p>Emily Crum is a communications specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She said filling holes in current information is a mission goal. The effort will also help meet a goal of mapping all of the United States' deep waters by 2030 and near-<strong>shore</strong> waters by 2040.</p>

<p>Scientists say that an early human <strong>species</strong> that settled in what is now Europe was <strong>wiped out</strong> by a long ice age over 1 million years ago.</p>
<p>The scientists say Homo erectus, considered the first member of the human family tree to have moved out of Africa, was not able to survive a cold period that lasted 4,000 years. They published the research in early August in the journal <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Chris Stringer is an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London. He was one of the study's writers. Stringer and his co-writers say they studied <strong>fossils</strong> and stone tools found in Europe.

<p>"There was probably a complete <strong>interruption</strong> in the early human occupation of Europe," Stringer said.</p>
<p>The researchers say early human species likely did not know how to make warm clothing or find ways to make fire in cold places. The cold weather froze the ground and prevented them from gathering food and hunting animals.</p>
<p>The scientists used ancient organic compounds left by <strong>algae</strong> and <strong>pollen</strong> off Portugal's coast to learn about climate change over 1 million years ago. The study showed the average air temperature dropped by 4.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Axel Timmermann is a climate physicist at Pusan National University in South Korea. He said the study shows that human occupation of Europe was not continuous but was interrupted by at least one "climate-<strong>induced</strong> <strong>extinction</strong>."</p>
<p>It is not clear how many early humans died off during this cold period, the researchers said. "Probably at best in the tens of thousands in Europe," Stringer said of the population at the time.</p>
<p>Another study writer was Chronis Tzedakis, a physical geography teacher at University College London. He said humans probably returned to Europe about 900,000 years ago after "<strong>evolutionary</strong> or <strong>behavioral</strong> changes" that permitted them to survive in cold conditions.</p>
<p>Scientists have records of human-like species in Spain and Germany from 800,000 to 600,000 years ago. Homo sapiens are known in Africa from 300,000 years ago and may have briefly come to Europe more than 200,000 years ago. But the main movement of humans into Europe came only 60,000 years ago.</p>

            <title>Is VinFast Worth More than VW, Ford?  (2023/8/17) | 越南VinFast汽车上市 市值超过大众和福特</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/is-vinfast-worth-more-than-vw-ford.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Shares of Vietnam's electric car company VinFast started publicly trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Tuesday. By the end of the first trading day, investors had pushed the market value of stock in the new company to $85 billion.<br/>
越南电动汽车公司VinFast的股票周二在纳斯达克证券交易所上市。截至第一个交易日收盘，投资者已将这家新公司的股票市值推高至850亿美元。</p>
<p>That is more than the market value of Germany's Volkswagen at $69.7 billion, America's Ford at $48 billion, and several other established automakers.<br/>
这超过了德国大众汽车697亿美元、美国福特汽车480亿美元和其他几家老牌汽车制造商的市值。</p>
<p>Share prices of VinFast increased about 270 percent, from around $10 to $37, on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the share price had dropped under $30. However, only a very small percentage of shares are being traded because VinFast founder Pham Nhat Vuong currently owns 99 percent of the company.<br/>
周二，VinFast的股价上涨了270%，从10美元左右涨到37美元。周三上午，股价跌至30美元以下。然而，该公司只有很小比例的股票在交易，因为VinFast创始人范日旺目前拥有该公司99%的股份。</p>
<p>Now comes the hard part: VinFast, an electric vehicle (EV) maker, will have to sell a lot more cars to meet the yearly target of 50,000 set by its founder.<br/>
现在困难的部分来了：电动汽车制造商VinFast将不得不销售更多的汽车，以实现其创始人设定的每年5万辆的目标。</p>
<p>For that, the company will need to bring in partners rather than selling directly on its own. It will also need to bring prices down to compete with other EV makers that have been lowering their prices since the start of the year.<br/>
为此，该公司将需要引入合作伙伴，而不是直接自己销售。它还需要降低价格，以便跟那些自年初以来就一直在降价的其它电动汽车制造商竞争。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bringing in partners<br/>
引入合作伙伴</span></p>
<p>VinFast chief executive Le Thi Thu Thuy said on Tuesday the EV maker would be moving to a new "hybrid model" for sales, bringing in distributors and dealers for overseas markets.<br/>
VinFast首席执行官黎氏秋水周二表示，这家电动汽车制造商将转向一款新的“混合动力车型”进行销售，为海外市场引入分销商和经销商。</p>
<p>"Opening our own stores is great but it takes a lot of time," she said. "Joining forces with other partners to go faster has always been our nature." As of June, VinFast said it has opened 122 showrooms worldwide, mostly on the West Coast of the United States.<br/>
她说：“开自营店很好，但需要很多时间。与其他合作伙伴携手合作，更快发展一直是我们的特性。”VinFast公司表示，截至6月，它已在全球开设了122个展厅，其中大部分位于美国西海岸。</p>
<p>Founder Vuong had said in May that VinFast could sell 50,000 EVs this year. The company has sold over 16,000 vehicles, including its sales in Vietnam, through the first seven months.<br/>
创始人范日旺曾在5月份表示，VinFast公司今年可以销售5万辆电动汽车。该公司前七个月已售出16000多辆汽车，其中包括在越南的销量。</p>
<p>Even with that target, VinFast will only be selling about one sixth of what it can produce at its Haiphong, Vietnam factory. A new factory is being built in the American state of North Carolina. The plant is expected to begin operations in 2025.<br/>
即使是这个目标，VinFast的也只售出了相当于其越南海防工厂大约六分之一产量的汽车。该公司的正在美国北卡罗来纳州建造一家新工厂。该工厂预计将于2025年开始运营。</p>
<p>The Vietnam-based company has sold just 137 VF8 models in the U.S. To increase sales, Vinfast will have to overcome poor reviews from U.S. automotive publications. Road &amp; Track called the vehicle "unacceptable" and MotorTrend said, "return to sender."<br/>
这家总部位于越南的公司在美国只销售了137辆VF8车型。为了提高销量，Vinfast必须解决美国汽车出版物的差评。Road&amp;Track称该车“不可接受”，而MotorTrend表示，“把它退给发货方。”</p>
<p>Business advisor AlixPartners has estimated that EV carmakers need yearly sales of 400,000 vehicles to cover their costs.<br/>
商业顾问公司AlixPartners估计，这家电动汽车制造商每年需要40万辆汽车的销量来覆盖其成本。</p>
<p>In China, most EV makers are losing money in a price competition aimed at increasing market share. In the U.S., EV makers, including Tesla and Ford, have recently lowered their prices in addition to federal government tax credits meant to get people to buy the vehicles. For comparison, the Tesla Model Y is almost $7,000 less than VinFast's VF8 with federal tax credits included.<br/>
在中国，大多数电动汽车制造商为了提高市场份额，都在价格竞争中赔钱。在美国，包括特斯拉和福特在内的电动汽车制造商最近都降低了价格，此外还有联邦政府的税收抵免，旨在让人们购买这些汽车。相比之下，特斯拉Model Y加上联邦税收减免后，比VinFast的VF8便宜了近7000美元。</p>
<p>Thuy said VinFast believed its products were priced competitively but was working to bring prices down. "There is no other automaker in the world that has as low a cost base as in Vietnam," she said. "All of that is leading to cost reduction in the future."<br/>
黎氏秋水表示，VinFast相信其产品的定价具有竞争力，但也在努力降低价格。她说：“世界上没有哪家汽车制造商的成本比越南的公司低。这些都将导致未来成本降低。”</p>

            <title>How to Help Your Garden Get Through the Heat  (2023/8/16)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Record-breaking heat is affecting plants in many places around the world. But <strong>gardening</strong> expert Jessica Damiano says selecting the right plants and a little care could save them.</p>
<p>Damiano wrote recently that her tomato plants have not developed much in the past few weeks, but her flower garden is doing very well. Despite temperatures over 37 degrees Celsius in the New York area, Damiano said she has watered her flower garden just two times this summer.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing heat-tolerant plants</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Ball Horticultural shows a bed of Bounce Pink Flame impatiens growing in a garden bed. (Ball Horticultural via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/11c8c859-6002-4dc6-947b-6d7f2c0a8e4d_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by Ball Horticultural shows a bed of Bounce "Pink Flame" impatiens growing in a garden bed. (Ball Horticultural via AP)</span></div>
<p>Damiano says that in extreme heat, and when that heat is dry, soil <strong>moisture</strong> evaporates quickly. Plants will turn to their own limited moisture storage when they need water. This requires them to use energy toward cooling and using water. This energy should be spent on growth, flowering, fruiting and reproducing. The stress often completely weakens the plant.</p>
<p>When plants are native to an area, they naturally develop deep, large root systems. These systems permit the plants to reach distant sources of moisture when the nearby area dries out.</p>
<p>Many foreign plants, including most plants that live for just one year, have root systems that are not deep. This means they must depend on the top few centimeters of soil for all of their water needs. When it dries up, so do they.</p>
<p>To save water, money, and effort, Damiano suggests researching which plants are native to your area. Some native plants for Damiano's New York area include yearly returning plants like bee balm, black-eyed Susan, and purple coneflower.</p>
<p>But she also has some non-native plants that<strong> tolerate</strong> both the heat and dry weather. She keeps yearly returning plants, or perennials, in her beds, and plants that last one growing season, or annuals, in containers.</p>
<p>Damiano says the flowering plant "Bounce" impatiens live up to their name in her containers. They <strong>bounce</strong> <strong>back</strong> from being weakened by a hot and dry day after being watered.</p>
<p>Plants like sedums, or stonecrop, are highly tolerant to dry, hot weather. This is because their leaves store moisture and release it as the plants need it. Other plants that can deal with heat include beardtongue, catmint, floss flower, lavender, and moss rose.</p>
<p><strong>Planting advice</strong></p>
<p>When planting, Damiano says she always dusts root balls with <strong>fungi </strong>called mycorrhizae. It helps grow roots and helps plants deal with severe heat. She also treats her plants once a month with two products: a seaweed-containing fish mixture and a vitamin-hormone-kelp product.</p>
<p>Seaweed and kelp are plants that grow in water. They have been shown to help other plants in difficult environments. These additions also help plants grow quickly after dividing and transplanting.</p>
<p>Finally, Damiano says the last addition is a good amount of <strong>mulch</strong> on top. Mulch not only keeps things looking clean, but it also helps to keep soil moisture and soil temperatures even. And it keeps unwanted plants from growing. Mulch can mean the difference between plant life and death when it gets hot.</p>

            <title>The Taliban’s Rule in Afghanistan after Two Years  (2023/8/16) | 塔利班对阿富汗两年的统治</title>

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202308/the-taliban-s-rule-in-afghanistan-after-two-years.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Two years ago Tuesday, the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan after NATO forces pulled out of the country. The Taliban are still the clear rulers. And the Taliban face no serious opposition that could defeat them.<br/>
两年前的这个周二，在北约部队撤出阿富汗后，塔利班夺取了对阿富汗的控制权。塔利班仍然是明确的统治者。并且塔利班没有遇到任何可以击败他们的强力反对力量。</p>
<p>They have avoided divisions by falling in line behind their leader. They have kept alive a struggling economy, in part by holding investment talks with neighboring countries. They have improved domestic security by suppressing armed groups like the Islamic State. They say they are fighting corruption and opium production.<br/>
他们与领导人保持一致，从而避免了分裂。他们通过与邻国展开投资谈判，在一定程度上维持了陷入困境的经济。他们通过镇压伊斯兰国等武装组织改善了国内安全。他们说他们正在打击腐败和鸦片生产。</p>
<p>But their bans on Afghan girls and women have been a major part of the Taliban's second year in power. They barred women and girls from parks, gyms, universities, jobs and nongovernmental groups and the United Nations. These orders followed an earlier ban, issued in the first year of Taliban rule, on girls going to school beyond sixth grade.<br/>
但他们对阿富汗女性的禁令是塔利班执政第二年的主要内容。他们禁止女性进入公园、健身房、大学、工作场所、非政府组织和联合国。在这些禁令之前，是塔利班统治首年发布的禁止女孩上六年级以上年级的早期禁令。</p>
<p>Here is a closer look at Taliban rule.<br/>
下面我们来仔细看看塔利班的统治。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have they excluded women from many areas of public life?<br/>
为什么他们把妇女排除在众多公共生活领域之外？</span></p>
<p>The Taliban say they are putting in place their view of Islamic law, or Sharia, in Afghanistan. This leaves no space for anything they believe is foreign or secular, including permitting women to work or study. This view of Islam is what drove the Taliban in the late 1990s, when they first seized power in the country. It still drives them today.<br/>
塔利班表示，他们正在阿富汗落实他们对伊斯兰教法的见解。这让他们认为是外国或世俗的东西失去了生存空间，包括允许女性工作或学习。这种对伊斯兰教的见解在20世纪90年代末塔利班首次夺取政权时激励着他们。时至今日，它仍然激励着他们。</p>
<p>Hibatullah Akhundzada is the Taliban supreme leader. He has praised the changes since the takeover in August of 2021. He claims life improved for Afghan women after foreign troops left and after the Islamic head covering, or hijab, became required again.<br/>
海巴图拉·阿洪扎达是塔利班最高领导人。他赞扬了自2021年8月掌权以来的变化。他声称，在外国军队离开以及再次要求佩戴伊斯兰头巾后，阿富汗妇女的生活有所改善。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What was the reaction to these bans?<br/>
对这些禁令有何反应？</span></p>
<p>Foreign governments, rights groups and international organizations denounced the restrictions. The U.N. said the bans were a major obstacle to the Taliban gaining international standing as the recognized government of Afghanistan. The country is losing foreign aid as major donors cut off their support.<br/>
外国政府、人权组织和国际组织谴责这些禁令。联合国表示，这些禁令是塔利班作为公认的阿富汗政府获得国际地位的主要障碍。由于主要捐助国切断了支持，该国正在失去外国援助。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are living conditions like in Afghanistan?<br/>
阿富汗的生活条件如何？</span></p>
<p>Nearly 80 percent of the previous, Western-backed Afghan government's budget came from foreign aid. The aid paid for hospitals, schools, factories and government ministries. That money is now largely cut off. The COVID-19 pandemic, medical shortages, climate change and hunger have made life very hard for Afghans. But aid agencies have helped provide basic services, including health care.<br/>
此前，西方支持的阿富汗政府的预算中，有近80%来自外国援助。这些援助用于承担医院、学校、工厂和政府部门的开支。这笔钱现在基本上被切断了。新冠肺炎大流行、医疗短缺、气候变化和饥饿使阿富汗人的生活非常艰难。但援助机构帮助提供了包括医疗保健在内的基本服务。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How likely are the Taliban to change direction?<br/>
塔利班转向的可能性有多大？</span></p>
<p>If the Taliban changes direction, it would likely be up to Akhundzada. He is behind the bans on women and girls. His laws are formed in the language of Islamic law and are absolute. The bans will only be lifted if Akhundzada orders it.<br/>
如果塔利班要转向，这很可能取决于阿洪扎达。他是对女性禁令的幕后推手。他的法律是用伊斯兰法律的语言形成的，是绝对权威。只有阿洪扎达下令，禁令才会解除。</p>
<p>Some Taliban leaders have spoken out against the way decisions are made. There has been disagreement about the bans on women and girls. But the Taliban's spokesman denounced these reports as propaganda.<br/>
一些塔利班领导人公开反对这种做决定的方式。关于对女性的禁令一直存在分歧。但塔利班发言人谴责这些报道是宣传战。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">International recognition<br/>
国际认可</span></p>
<p>Aid officials say the Taliban consider recognition as an entitlement, not something to be negotiated. The officials also say the Taliban sees meetings with powerful nations like China and Russia as signs that they are building international relations.<br/>
援助官员表示，塔利班将国际认可视为一种权利，而非谈判的对象。这些官员还说，塔利班将与中国和俄罗斯等强国的会晤视为他们正在建立国际关系的标志。</p>
<p>The Taliban are not officially in the international community. But they appear to have enough interaction with countries to slowly move toward normal international relations. Countries like China, Russia and Pakistan want an end to sanctions.<br/>
塔利班没有正式加入国际社会。但他们似乎与各国有足够的互动，缓慢走向正常的国际关系。中国、俄罗斯和巴基斯坦等国希望结束对塔利班的制裁。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What opposition is there to the Taliban?<br/>
有什么塔利班的反对力量？</span></p>
<p>There is no armed or political opposition with enough support to remove the Taliban from power. A fighting force resisting Taliban rule north of Kabul is being violently defeated.<br/>
没有任何武装或政治反对派得到足够的支持，可以推翻塔利班的政权。一支抵抗塔利班在喀布尔北部统治的战斗部队被暴力击败。</p>
<p>The Islamic State has struck targets in deadly bombings. But the militants lack fighters, money and other resources for a major fight against the Taliban.<br/>
伊斯兰国用致命爆炸袭击目标。但这些武装分子缺乏战斗人员、资金和其他资源来对抗塔利班。</p>

<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump and 18 others have been <strong>indicted</strong> over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the American state of Georgia.</p>
<p>The indictment is the fourth set of criminal charges against Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.</p>
<p>Georgia's state government lawyers accuse Trump, his former lawyers and other aides of a "criminal <strong>enterprise</strong>" to keep him in power. The legal case uses a law, known as the RICO Act, which is often used to target members of organized crime groups. The indictment contains 41 charges.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The indictment in Georgia against former President Donald Trump is photographed Monday, Aug. 14, 2023.

(AP Photo/Jon Elswick)</span></div>
<p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis told reporters late Monday night: "Rather than <strong>abide </strong>by Georgia's legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal, <strong>racketeering </strong>enterprise to overturn Georgia's presidential election result."</p>
<p>The indictment against Trump is a 98-page document. It lists several actions that Georgia government lawyers say Trump, or his allies took to undo the election result. They include a phone call in which Trump reportedly asked a state official to "find" 11,780 votes, <strong>harassing</strong> election workers, trying to create false electoral college electors, and stealing data from a voting machine.</p>
<p>Trump attacked Willis and called the indictment a "witch hunt" in a social media post overnight. He added, "Why didn't they Indict 2.5 years ago? Because they wanted to do it right in the middle of my political campaign."</p>
<p>The indictment comes just two weeks after <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/trump-indicted-accused-of-trying-to-overturn-2020-election/7208659.html">a federal grand jury charged Trump</a> with crimes connected to the 2020 presidential election. The federal indictment said Trump tried and failed to use federal and state officials to overturn the election. It said he blocked the counting of electoral votes <strong>certifying</strong> President Joe Biden's victory on January 6, 2021, as supporters attacked the Capitol building and police where the process was taking place.</p>
<p><strong>Other legal actions against Trump</strong></p>
<p>Trump has been surrounded by legal troubles since leaving office two years ago.</p>
<p>In June, Trump was charged with <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-indicts-former-president-donald-trump-with-crimes/7130540.html">illegally holding classified national security documents</a>, <strong>obstruction</strong>, making false statements, and plotting with others to carry out a crime. A trial has been set for May 2024.</p>
<p>The office of the Manhattan District Attorney in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/former-us-president-trump-to-face-criminal-charges-for-first-time/7036299.html">the state of New York charged Trump</a> with criminally falsifying "business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election." That trial is set for next March.</p>
<p>The office of the New York State Attorney General charged Trump and his business, the Trump Organization, with misleading banks and tax officials to get loans and tax benefits. A trial will start in state court in October. Additionally, Trump's company was fined $1.6 million after being found guilty of tax <strong>fraud</strong> in another New York court in December.</p>
<p>Last May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of sexually abusing and <strong>defaming</strong> the writer E. Jean Carroll and awarded her $5 million in a civil case. Carroll has brought a second legal case seeking $10 million which is planned for January.</p>
<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing in all cases.</p>

<p>Fluency is the ability to read a <strong>text</strong> quickly and understand it. It is the bridge between reading a word and <strong>comprehension</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What fluency looks like</strong></p>
<p>Fluent readers can do the following:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Early Literacy: Fluency" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-cd15-08db9383150a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Early Literacy: Fluency</span></div>
<ul>
<li>They can read with correct pauses and tone of voice or expression.</li>
<li>They do not spend time figuring out each word.</li>
<li>They make connections between the text and their own knowledge.</li>
<li>They understand the larger meaning of the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fluency grows over time, and fluency develops from a lot of practice. To read fluently, readers must be able to divide the text into meaningful "chunks." These chunks, or pieces, include phrases and clauses within a sentence.</p>
<p>Fluency is not a reading stage of development in which students can read all<em> </em>words quickly and easily all the time. Fluency changes depending on the text. A student may be able to read a text they know fluently, but then read a new text very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching tips for fluency</strong></p>
<p><u>Read a text out loud. Then, read it again.</u></p>
<p>Students need to read and then re-read texts out loud to teachers and classmates. Teachers should give feedback. Use activities that make students re-read texts. A good activity for increasing fluency is "reader's theater." A description of this activity comes at the end of the article.</p>
<p><u>Choose the right text.</u> The texts for fluency practice should not be too easy or too hard. If the text is too hard, students may have to work too hard to say the words while failing to understand them.</p>
<p><u>Read out loud.</u> If a student has a low reading level, reading silently is not very effective. It is better to read out loud alone, with a partner, or with the whole class.</p>
<p><u>Model fluent reading.</u></p>
<p>Teachers should model fluent reading. Students re-read the text out loud.</p>
<p><u>Keep read-aloud activities interesting and active.</u></p>
<p>Students should hear many different texts read fluently. Read the texts out loud with active expressions and body language.</p>
<p><u>Read texts and not separate words.</u></p>
<p>Reading word lists might improve vocabulary. However, it may not help students to learn to read fluently.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for fluency</strong></p>
<p><u>Strategy: "Reader's Theater"</u></p>
<p>Reader's theater is a fun activity to improve fluency. With reader's theater students read from a <strong>script</strong>. They do not need to memorize. The best scripts for this strategy have lots of dialogue and characters.</p>
<p>Choose a story that can be divided into parts. Give reading parts to each student. If you have more students than parts, you can have two or three groups act out the same story. Ask students to practice. First, they read their parts out loud. Then, the teacher helps them. Once the students have read the texts once or twice, they can design a set or costumes. Finally, they read their parts for an audience or their classmates.</p>
<p>Why use "Reader's Theater?"</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps readers learn to read aloud fluently and with expression.</li>
<li>You can use this strategy for many kinds of writing. You can read science, math, and life skills lessons as theater.</li>
<li>It helps build reading confidence. Reader's theater can be fun for very shy students. Because they are playing a role, they may feel more confident to read out loud.</li>
<li>It allows students to be creative. They can make props, costumes, and design a set. Students can play music.</li>
<li>It also tests a student's listening skills. They must know when one actor finishes a line before saying theirs.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Strategy: Partner Reading</u></p>
<p>With Partner Reading, students read out loud to each other. It helps students to work together and supports <strong>peer </strong>learning. Partner Reading can be used with many kinds of writing.</p>
<p>Pair students with the same reading ability, or pair high-level readers with low-level readers.</p>
<p>Tell students how they will use partner reading. For example, they can read out loud together. They can take turns reading parts. Or one person can read while the other person listens.</p>
<p>Partners can ask each other about the text. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was your part about?</li>
<li>What was your favorite part?</li>
<li>What words did you already know?</li>
<li>Which part gave you trouble?</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Strategy: Group Reading </u></p>
<p>Reading together as a class gives less skilled readers the chance to practice and get help. It gives students a model for fluent reading. It helps to provide sight-reading ability. Choose a text that works well for reading out loud as a group.</p>
<p>Group reading should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have repeated grammar patterns and repeated words</li>
<li>be not too long</li>
<li>be at the reading level of most students</li>
</ul>
<p>Give each student a copy of the text or write it on the board. Read the text out loud. Model fluent reading for the students. As you read, ask the students to follow along. Have all the students read the text out loud together.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for fluency</strong></p>
<p>It is important to assess often. This will guide your instruction. All assessments for fluency should be done one-on-one with each student. Choose a text that fits the level of your student. Have them read out loud. Record how long it takes them and how many mistakes they made.</p>
<p>When it comes to assessing fluency, experts say look for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the student stress appropriate words?</li>
<li>Does the student's voice rise and fall at the right times as they read?</li>
<li>Does the student read punctuation correctly in the text?</li>
<li>Does the student read with emotion, such as happiness?</li>
<li>Does the student pause correctly where subjects and verbs end, at phrases, and with other language chunks?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the tips, strategies, and assessment methods that best serve your learners. Change them to fit your students and teaching situation.</p>

            <title>Worldcoin Draws Attention Due to Privacy Concerns  (2023/8/15)</title>

<span class="datetime">14 August 2023</span><br/>
<p>Weeks after its international launch, Worldcoin is drawing the attention of officials around the world. Kenya's government has gone so far as to shut down the service.</p>
<p>The international ID company, backed by big investors in Silicon Valley's technology industry, now has to defend itself in investigations. The central question is whether the <strong>biometric</strong> data that the company is collecting is secure or not.</p>
<p><strong>What is Worldcoin? </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Carlos Jose, 21, has his eyes scanned by an orb, at a Worldcoin registration point in Barcelona, Spain, on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/db3ac04a-64c8-4b47-9a31-a8d42bdf4ce0_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Carlos Jose, 21, has his eyes scanned by an orb, at a Worldcoin registration point in Barcelona, Spain, on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)</span></div>
<p>Worldcoin is the creation of Sam Altman. He is best known as the head of OpenAI, the maker of the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The goal of Worldcoin and the company backing it, Tools for Humanity, is to give people a form of identification that could never be stolen or copied. Worldcoin creates a "World ID", an identification tool, by <strong>scanning</strong> someone's eyes through "orbs." These are special devices that capture images of the irises, the colored parts of the eyes.</p>
<p>One possible use for such an ID tool would be online services. Such services require that people remember passwords and usernames for websites they have signed up for.</p>
<p>The security of those sites can have problems, however. There have been several security issues where usernames and passwords have been stolen. Instead of using old technology like passwords, people could just sign up using their World ID.</p>
<p><strong>What is its connection to crypto? </strong></p>
<p>Worldcoin is an identification project. But it is also using <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> to get people to sign up. The Worldcoin <strong>token </strong>is trading for roughly $1.90. However, its value is largely based on expectations rather than its usability as a form of money.</p>
<p>Worldcoin launched officially in July. As part of the event, early users were given an amount of cryptocurrency worth between $50 and $60. Most of the countries where Worldcoin launched do not widely use or accept crypto.</p>
<p>Further, $50 is a lot of money in developing countries where people are being asked to sign up, including Kenya, where the average monthly wage is around $170.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Worldcoin getting attention? </strong></p>
<p>Thousands of Kenyans lined up in Nairobi in early August at a center where Worldcoin took images of their irises in exchange for 25 coins worth about $50.</p>
<p>The lines included mothers with children on their backs. Some of those in line told local media that they had traveled from a distance after friends said "free money" was being handed out. They admitted not knowing why they needed to scan their irises and where that information would go.</p>
<p>Others who waited for hours included college-educated Kenyans. Many are unemployed and angry over the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>The Kenyan government has since suspended new sign-ups for Worldcoin as it investigates whether people's information is being properly protected.</p>
<p><strong>What are the privacy concerns? </strong></p>
<p>Worldcoin's orbs collect data by taking images of a person's iris. While Worldcoin argues that the data is used to create a special, secure form of identification, privacy experts have concerns that the company may use the information in other ways, like personalized marketing.</p>
<p>That has led some countries to investigate Worldcoin's operations, including France, Germany and now Kenya.</p>
<p>Privacy experts are worried that Worldcoin could, in time, be a victim to criminals, similar to data thefts at other large companies. Privacy experts have said biometric data is already being sold in places like China and that could spread to other places.</p>
<p>Last week, Worldcoin discussed the privacy concerns on its website. The company wrote everything is available as a choice and no personal data "is <strong>disclosed by default</strong>, enabling each holder to decide which (if any) personal data to share with third parties when using World ID."</p>

            <title>COVID-19 Hospitalizations in the US Are Increasing Again  (2023/8/15)</title>

<p>The number of people entering the hospital with COVID-19 has increased in the United States since early July. The increase is similar to the past three summers but with far fewer cases than before.</p>
<p>With an <strong>updated </strong>vaccine still months away, experts worry this summer's increase in hospitalizations could become a bigger problem.</p>
<p><strong>How bad is the increase?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A sign announcing a face mask requirement is displayed at a hospital in Buffalo Grove, Ill., on January 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/bda64afb-134d-4b61-8cd7-f15e612c7b70_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A sign announcing a face mask requirement is displayed at a hospital in Buffalo Grove, Ill., on January 13, 2023.

<p>For the week ending July 29, COVID-19 hospital <strong>admissions</strong> were at 9,056. That is an increase of about 12 percent from the week before. But it is a lot less than the former high points. For example, there were 44,000 weekly hospital admissions in early January, nearly 45,000 in late July 2022, and 150,000 when the Omicron subvariant spread in January 2022.</p>
<p>Dr. David Dowdy is an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said it is increasing a little, but it is not something to be overly concerned about.</p>
<p>It is likely that infections are rising too, but data is lacking. Federal officials ended the public health emergency in May. That means that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many states no longer follow the number of <strong>positive</strong> test results.</p>
<p>Since early June, about 500 to 600 people have died each week. The number of deaths appears to be unchanging this summer. But past increases in deaths usually follow behind hospitalizations.</p>
<p><strong>How are we following the virus?</strong></p>
<p>The amount of the COVID-19 virus in wastewater has been rising since late June across the U.S. In the coming weeks, health officials say they will look closely at wastewater levels. People will be returning from summer travel and students will be going back to school then.</p>
<p>Cristin Young is an infectious disease expert at Biobot Analytics. The CDC uses Biobot Analytics to study wastewater. She said researchers are finding higher levels of COVID-19 in wastewater in the Northeast and South.</p>
<p>"It's important to remember right now the <strong>concentrations</strong> are still fairly low," Young said. She noted that it is about 2.5 times lower than last summer.</p>
<p>There is not one kind of variant that appears much more than others. But there is a higher number of cases from one kind of Omicron variant – EG.5. Some are calling this variant "eris" but scientists are not using that name.</p>
<p>"There are a couple that we're watching, but we're not seeing anything like Delta or Omicron," Young said, talking about former variants that caused high increases in COVID cases. And genetic changes to the virus that happen naturally do not necessarily make it more dangerous.</p>
<p>"Just because we have a new subvariant doesn't mean that we are <strong>destined </strong>to have an increase in bad outcomes," Dowdy said.</p>
<p><strong>When is the new vaccine coming?</strong></p>
<p>This autumn, officials expect to see updated COVID-19 vaccines that contain the Omicron variant XBB.1.5. It is an important change from today's combination shots. They mix the <strong>original</strong> coronavirus with last year's most common Omicron variants.</p>
<p>It is not clear when people can expect what officials hope is a yearly COVID-19 vaccine in autumn. Drug makers Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are all creating vaccines with the XBB update. But the Food and Drug Administration will have to approve the shots. And the CDC must then issue suggestions on their use.</p>
<p>Dr. Mandy Cohen is the new CDC director. She said she expects people will get their COVID-19 vaccines where they get their vaccines for another infectious disease, the flu. She expects people will get vaccines at places like work or drug stores, rather than places that were set up just for COVID-19 vaccinations. Those places were set up early in the pandemic as part of the emergency measure.</p>
<p>"This is going to be our first <strong>fall</strong> and winter season coming out of the public health emergency, and I think we are all recognizing that we are living with COVID, flu, and RSV," Cohen told The Associated Press last week. Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV, is another infectious disease. "But the good news is we have more tools than ever before."</p>

<p>A mountain guide who recently climbed the world's 14 tallest mountains in record time has set a new goal for himself. Tenjen Sherpa of Nepal says he now wants to become the youngest person to climb all the peaks twice.</p>
<p>Last month, the 35-year-old Tenjen and 37–year-old Norwegian Kristin Harila, broke the record for the fastest climb of the mountains. All of the peaks are above 8,000 meters. The two reached the final mountaintop, K2, in 92 days. It was very speedy. The record they broke was set at 189 days.</p>
<p>Now, Tenjen is preparing for his new goal. He said he hopes to start by climbing Mount Shishapangma in China in the next two months. "I have already done (it) once and I want to double it," he told the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nepali climbing guide Tenjen Sherpa, 35, poses during an interview with the Associated Press in Kathmandu, Nepal, Wednesday, August 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)</span></div>
<p>Only person has climbed all 14 peaks twice. Forty-eight-year-old Sanu Sherpa completed his second climb of the mountains last year.</p>
<p>Tenjen has already climbed seven of the mountains twice. He hopes to climb the remaining seven by next spring.</p>
<p>Tenjen climbed the first of these mountains in 2016, when he reached the top of Mount Dhaulagiri in Nepal. He has since made several similar climbs every year, including four trips to Mount Everest.</p>
<p>He and his three brothers set a record as the most <strong>siblings</strong> to have climbed Mount Kanchenjunga. Kanchenjunga is the world's third-tallest mountain, behind Mount Everest and K2.</p>
<p>Tenjen started working as a mountain guide to support his family. However, in April, the Kathmandu company Seven Summits Treks hired Tenjen to join Harila's trip to Mount Shishapangma. Harila and Tenjen then climbed the rest of the mountains together.</p>
<p>"It was my good luck and (I) was <strong>fortunate</strong> to be with her in the team," Tenjen said to the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p>Tenjen plans to climb Shishapangma for the second time later this fall. He plans on carrying with him pictures of a brother who died. Shishapangma was the only one of the 14 tallest mountains that this brother had not climbed. Tenjen says he will bury the images on the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Tenjen told the <em>AP</em> that Sherpas do not get enough government recognition for their hard work.</p>
<p>"It is not possible to just continue climbing mountains as you grow older, so what else is there than to think of migrating <strong>abroad</strong>," Tenjen pointed out.</p>
<p>Tenjen never attended school growing up. He has difficulty reading and writing. But, living in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, his children are able to get an education. Tenjen thinks, though, that since more children will be growing up in cities in the future, they will not have the skills to become Sherpas.</p>

            <title>Death Total Grows as Hawaii Works to Recover from Wildfires  (2023/8/15)</title>

<p>Hawaii's Governor Joshua Green told U.S. broadcaster CBS that the number of dead from wildfires on the island of Maui will continue to grow over the next week.</p>
<p>Green said the search for bodies and survivors will take at least 10 days and it is "impossible" to guess how many people died. He said he expects crews will find 10 to 20 bodies each day.</p>
<p>"We are prepared for many tragic stories," Green said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Two people examine a burned house after an inferno destroyed much of the historic Maui resort town of Lahaina, Hawaii, Aug. 13, 2023. (Sandy Hooper/USA Today Network via REUTERS)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d5df-08db9cf009df_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Two people examine a burned house after an inferno destroyed much of the historic Maui resort town of Lahaina, Hawaii, Aug. 13, 2023. (Sandy Hooper/USA Today Network via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>At least 96 people died when a fire spread through the town of Lahaina on Maui last Tuesday. Officials said the fires moved nearly two kilometers per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for bodies</strong></p>
<p>It is the deadliest natural disaster in Hawaii since a huge ocean wave killed 61 people in 1960. It will be the costliest disaster since a hurricane in 1992. Green estimated the damage to be $5.6 billion.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association said the fires on Maui caused the most deaths from a wildfire in the U.S. since 1918 when over 450 died in Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Firefighters were still trying to contain small fires over the weekend. Dogs trained to look for human remains helped people search the burned Lahaina area. The town was home to about 13,000 people.</p>
<p>"They're going street by street, <strong>block</strong> by block," said Jeff Hickman, of the Hawaii Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Officials have said the area might be unsafe for some time. The fire might have released dangerous gases and made water undrinkable. People who cannot return home, or those whose homes have burned, will live in hotels and <strong>rental</strong> homes.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for a cause </strong></p>
<p>Green said officials are investigating the cause of the fire. They also want to know why safety officials failed to activate some emergency signals.</p>
<p>Green said dry weather and winds from a hurricane caused the fire to move quickly.</p>
<p>Those in the area said they had little warning about the danger. They said the fire surrounded their homes in minutes. Some people jumped into the ocean to escape.</p>
<p>The fire damaged power lines and reduced mobile phone service, so some people did not get messages that the fire was getting close. Warning <strong>sirens</strong> placed around the island that are supposed to turn on in case of a disaster did not turn on.</p>
<p>‘We'll know soon whether or not they did enough to get those sirens going," Green told the broadcaster MSNBC.</p>
<p>
<strong>Searching for comfort</strong></p>
<p>Some people went to a Catholic church or attended other religious services over the weekend.</p>
<p>Akanesi Vaa was at a church. She said she and her family left their car and climbed a fence to get to a safe place.</p>
<p>"I think a lot of us needed to hear today's message," she said. "All these ashes are going to turn into beauty. I know Lahaina will come back ten times stronger."</p>
<p>Scott Landis is a Christian church leader in Makena. He said about 100 people attended his services – twice the usual number.</p>
<p>"You could tell people were here, looking for a word of hope," he said. Many, he added, did not know the <strong>location</strong> of friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Asking for help</strong></p>
<p>Some people sent messages on social media services such as Instagram asking people to look for relatives.</p>
<p>"People are being found alive and severely <strong>disoriented</strong> due to what they have gone through," wrote Heather Baylosis on Saturday. She was looking for the parents of her partner.</p>
<p>Famous television star Oprah Winfrey lives <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_gugQsn3v">on</a> Maui part of the year. She brought supplies such as towels, water and personal washing products to those who were staying in a shelter. She warned that, in time, the people documenting the disaster will leave and the story will no longer be in newspapers and on television.</p>
<p>"But we're all still going to be here trying to <strong>figure out</strong> what is the best way to rebuild," Winfrey said.</p>
<p>J.P. Mayoga is helping, too. He works as a cook at a large hotel. Now, he is making meals for 200 hotel employees and their family members who have been living there since Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said it is good that the co-workers can be together.</p>
<p>"Everybody has their story, and everybody has lost something...And they understand what's going on in each other's lives."</p>

        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<span class="datetime">29 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>2024 is just hours away. Before the world welcomes a new year, we remember some of the influential people who died in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Day O'Connor</strong></p>
<p>We start with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - President Joe Biden attends a funeral service for retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at the Washington National Cathedral, December 19, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/fbb20de5-880f-4b08-b66d-74a56da7636d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">FILE - President Joe Biden attends a funeral service for retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at the Washington National Cathedral, December 19, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</span></div>
<p>O'Connor died on December 1. She made history in 1981 when she became the first woman appointed to the United States' highest court. She served in the position for 25 years.</p>
<p>The judge was considered a centrist, or a moderate, in her court opinions. She was often considered the "<strong>swing vote</strong>" on major issues such as abortion, affirmative action and voting rights.</p>
<p>Sandra Day O'Connor was born in El Paso, Texas in 1930. She grew up on a large cow farm there.</p>
<p>The young Sandra was an excellent student and entered Stanford University in California when she was 16, earning a degree in economics. She went on to study law at Stanford. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her class in 1952.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan nominated her to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981. In announcing his choice, he described the judge as "a person for all seasons."</p>
<p>American President Joe Biden spoke at her funeral. He called her "a daughter of the West" and "a pioneer in her own right." He praised her for seeking, in his words, "equal justice under law her whole life."</p>
<p>O'Connor died from problems linked to the disease dementia and a lung infection. She was 93 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Kissinger </strong></p>
<p>The world also said goodbye to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who died November 29.</p>
<p>He was 100 years old.</p>
<p>The German-born Jewish refugee served as the U.S. top diplomat under two presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He won praise and severe criticism in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>Kissinger helped restore ties between the United States and China. He also negotiated the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalynn Carter</strong></p>
<p>American former first lady Rosalynn Carter died on November 19. She was the closest adviser to her husband, former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>She served as first lady from 1977 to 1981. She <strong>advocated </strong>for better mental health care and help for caregivers in millions of American families. Overseas, she fought disease, mass hunger and the abuse of women and girls. She continued humanitarian work with her husband for 40 years following their time in the White House.</p>
<p>The couple had been married for 77 years when Rosalynn Carter died at the age of 96.</p>
<p>Others from the world of politics who died this year include: former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, former Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf, and former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.</p>
<p><strong>Tina Turner</strong></p>
<p>The world also lost cultural leaders in 2023, including the so-called "Queen of Rock ‘n' Roll."</p>
<p>American Singer Tina Turner died in May at the age of 83.</p>
<p>The entertainer teamed up with husband Ike Turner for a series of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and '70s. Ike was abusive and beat Tina. She left the marriage and returned as a solo artist with a best-selling album, <em>Private Dancer,</em> in 1984.</p>
<p>"How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and <strong>trauma</strong> and used it as a means to help change the world?" actor Angela Bassett said in a statement. Bassett played Turner in the 1993 movie <em>What's Love Got to Do With It</em>.</p>
<p>Turner sold more than 150 million records worldwide and won 12 Grammys. The performer was voted along with Ike Turner into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and individually in 2021. Turner's life story was made into a movie and Broadway musical.</p>
<p>Mick Jagger of the music group The Rolling Stones called Turner "<strong>inspiring</strong>, warm, funny and <strong>generous</strong>" in an Instagram post. And he wrote that Turner "helped me so much when I was young, and I will never forget her."</p>
<p><strong>Kenzaburo Oe </strong></p>
<p>Several Nobel Prize winners died this year, including Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe. The Nobel literature laureate wrote darkly poetic novels based on his childhood memories from Japan's postwar occupation. He also wrote from his experiences as the parent of a disabled son. Oe died on March 3 at the age of 88.<br type="_moz"/>
</p>
<p><strong>World's oldest person</strong></p>
<p>And the world lost its oldest resident in 2023. French religious worker, or nun, Lucile Rando, died at home in southern France a few weeks before her 119th birthday.</p>
<p>Sister André, as she was known, was born in the town of Alès, southern France, in 1904. The Gerontology Research Group, which confirms details about people thought to be 110 or older, listed her as the oldest known person in the world after the death of Japan's Kane Tanaka, aged 119, in 2022.</p>
<p>Sister André was also one of the world's oldest survivors of COVID-19.</p>
<p>She tested positive for the coronavirus in January 2021, shortly before her 117th birthday. She showed so few signs of the virus that she did not even realize she was infected. News media around the world reported her survival.</p>
<p>In April last year, she was asked about her exceptional <strong>longevity</strong> through two world wars. Sister André told French media, "Working...makes you live. I worked until I was 108."</p>
<p>She was also known to enjoy a daily glass of wine and chocolate.</p>

<span class="byline">By Hai Do</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">29 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Many people consider choices from dictionary publishers, including <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/ai-hallucinate-authentic-or-rizz-for-word-of-the-year/7385065.html">artificial intelligence, authentic or rizz</a>, to be "words of the year." But the Associated Press reported on some words used in other parts of the world that have been gaining popularity.</p>
<p>So today, we will look at other words from around the world for 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Password child in Australia</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Brazilian tourists hold hands standing in a circle in the Pueblo Encanto park in Capilla del Monte, Argentina, July 19, 2023. Known as the nones, they describe themselves as atheists or nothing in particular. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-fadb-08dc070c609d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Brazilian tourists hold hands standing in a circle in the Pueblo Encanto park in Capilla del Monte, Argentina, July 19, 2023. Known as the "nones," they describe themselves as atheists or "nothing in particular." (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File)</span></div>
<p>In Australia, the local Macquarie Dictionary has been selecting a "word of the month" all year. One was "cozzie livs," a word that Australians use to <strong>complain</strong> about the high cost of living. Another was "murder noodle" for a snake in a country that is home to the world's most poisonous snake.</p>
<p>But "password child" is a word that many parents can recognize. Australians use the term to describe children seen as favored over their brothers or sisters because their name is used in their parents' passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Kitawaramba in Kenya (Swahili) </strong></p>
<p>Paul Mackenzie, a cleric in the East African nation of Kenya, said the word "kitawaramba" on his way to court. He was accused of asking his followers to starve themselves in order to meet Jesus. More than 400 people died as a result.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar word appeared to be a threat. Now Kenyans use it to warn others that something bad might happen to them for their actions.</p>
<p><strong>Bwa kale in Haiti (Creole)</strong></p>
<p>Criminal groups have brought violence, including killings and kidnappings, to the daily lives of people in Haiti, an island nation in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>Civilians have been fighting back and saying "bwa kale" as they chase suspected criminals. "Bwa Kale" means "<strong>peeled</strong> wood" in the Haitian Creole language.</p>
<p>The term had long been used to express male <strong>dominance</strong> and power. Now it has spread overseas. A video on social media shows a group of Latino soccer fans saying "Bwa kale!" after their team beat an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>税 (zei) in Japan (Japanese)</strong></p>
<p>The top Buddhist leader at the Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto wrote the word 税 (zei) in a closely watched yearly event.</p>
<p>The Japanese public chose "zei," which means taxes, to best represent the year 2023. Many expect taxes to increase to pay for the country's military buildup. Under the latest national security plan, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government aims to double Japan's yearly defense spending to about $69 billion. That would make the country the world's third largest military spender after the U.S. and China.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 9pt;">The nones around the world</strong></p>
<p>In many countries, there has been a big increase in the number of people who select the word "none" when asked about their religion.</p>
<p>The nonbelievers, atheists, or agnostics have become known as the "nones."</p>
<p>The "nones" are believed to make up of 30 percent or more of the adult population in the United States and Canada, as well as several European countries. Japan, Israel and Uruguay are among other nations where large numbers of people are "nones."</p>
<p>And that's the world in "other" words for 2023.</p>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the words "change" and "vary."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Change and Vary" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-4c54-08dc07f9f5ba_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Change and Vary</span></div>
<p>I'm Ali, and I live in Mashhad, Iran.</p>
<p>What is the difference between "change" and "vary?"</p>
<p>I'm keen on knowing how American people use "vary" in different forms in daily conversations.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Ali</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for writing to us, Ali!</p>
<p>Here is the first major difference between the word "change" and the word "vary": Only one of them is a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>"Change" is that word. You can "change your opinion" for example. That's change as a verb.</p>
<p>You can also have "<em>a</em> change of opinion." That's change as a noun!</p>
<p>"Vary" is more narrow in meaning. It means to make a partial change in something, or to diversify something.</p>
<p>Sometimes change and vary are <strong>synonyms</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's look at each one more closely.</p>
<p><strong>Change as a verb</strong></p>
<p>While "change" can be either a noun or a verb, we will compare the verbal meanings and uses to "vary."</p>
<p>It can be used in a lot of different situations and can be a synonym for many other verbs like transform, exchange, switch or alter.</p>
<p>"Change" meanings range from making a difference or altering something particular to completely transforming or replacing something.</p>
<p><em>Many schools are changing the college application requirements in response to the ending of</em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/us-colleges-ask-for-more-writing-after-affirmative-action-ban/7209025.html"><em> Affirmative Action.</em></a></p>
<p><em>Water changes from a liquid to a solid when it freezes at zero degrees Celsius</em>.</p>
<p>"Change" can also mean making a slight modification in something to switching or making a shift from one thing to another.</p>
<p><em>The leaves change colors every autumn. </em></p>
<p><em>Emma changed her shirt because she spilled something on it.</em></p>
<p><em>Derek changed his money from dollars to euros when he went to France. </em></p>
<p>Andrey's <strong>accent</strong> changed after he moved to the big city.</p>
<p><strong>Vary </strong></p>
<p>Now let's look at "vary."</p>
<p>"Vary" is a verb. It can mean to make a partial change or to differentiate between items by size, amount or degree.</p>
<p><em>I like to vary my meals with different types of grains and greens.</em></p>
<p><em>Insects vary in size from large to very small.</em></p>
<p>It can also mean to show or experience a change.</p>
<p><em>The night sky varies depending on the Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun.</em></p>
<p><em>Interest rates vary due to how the economy is.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Ali.</p>

<h2 class="wsw__h2">Words in This Story</h2>
<p><strong>synonyms </strong><em>–</em> <em>n</em>. a word that is similar in meaning to another word</p>

<p>This year, social media services gained a lot of attention for their growth methods and for their influence.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press</em> recently looked back at 2023 to see what developments in social media were most important and what might be ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter becomes X</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An X sign rests atop the company headquarters in downtown San Francisco, on July 28, 2023.

<p>In October of 2022, businessman Elon Musk <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/twitter-introduces-new-x-logo-to-replace-blue-bird/7194172.html">took over</a> Twitter. He promised to make big changes at the social media service. Musk is known for leading the electric vehicle company Tesla and SpaceX, a space transport company. He bought Twitter for $44 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Musk dismissed about 75 percent of the company's workforce soon after the deal was completed. He said the dismissals were necessary to make Twitter more effective and to increase profits. He also announced plans to have Twitter users pay eight dollars a month to keep their verified accounts. Verified accounts are identified as belonging to people with a lot of followers.</p>
<p>As chief, Musk also lifted some existing restrictions on users, including many well-known people who had been barred by earlier Twitter leadership. Former U.S. President Donald Trump was among the Twitter users whose accounts were <strong>reinstated</strong>.</p>
<p>Musk said those changes were part of a larger effort to protect the free speech of Twitter users. But critics said his plans were likely to increase the amount of harmful content and hate speech on the service.</p>
<p>This year, the AP noted that some LGBTQ groups have raised concerns that X is less safe. Some activist groups said they have left the service.</p>
<p>Many Twitter users chose to leave the service earlier this year because of Musk's changes. Some advertisers stopped doing business with the company. In October, X said it had over 500 million users and is adding users all the time. The company also said it has improved in combating misleading or false information by using Community Notes. X says it uses over 100,000 people to help confirm information.</p>
<p>Musk has said he hopes to change X into an "everything app" like China's WeChat. But it remains unclear if U.S. and Western users like the idea of using one app for nearly all their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Social media competition</strong></p>
<p>Many users criticized the changes Musk was putting in place at X. Other services aimed to provide competition.</p>
<p>Mastodon is a service from a German software developer that lets users share information across several apps. Bluesky is a service that came out of Twitter and has connections to former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey. Bluesky operates by invitation only.</p>
<p>Some users who did not like the changes to Twitter went to those services.</p>
<p>In July, the parent company of Facebook, Meta, launched another <strong>rival</strong> to X called Threads. Millions of people joined after the announcement. In December, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company was testing "interoperability." That is an idea that lets people use their accounts on different services, or platforms. Zuckerberg said the company was performing a "test where posts from Threads accounts will be available on Mastodon and other services that use the Activity Pub protocol."</p>
<p><strong>Is social media good for children's mental health?</strong></p>
<p>Social media's influence on children's mental health gained a lot of attention this year. The U.S. surgeon general warned in May that there is not enough evidence to show that children and teenagers are safe using the services. Dr. Vivek Murthy called for technology companies and parents to take "immediate action to protect their kids now."</p>
<p>Murthy noted how social media is pushing big changes in the way children think of themselves, form friendships and experience the world.</p>
<p>In October, about 33 states brought legal action against Meta for harming young people's health. The legal action said the company regularly collects information on children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>And in December, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed major changes to laws controlling the way companies can follow and advertise to children. The agency proposed turning off targeted advertisements to children under 13 and limiting <strong>notifications</strong> to them.</p>
<p><strong>And in 2024...</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence powers chatbots that perform writing tasks and create material for users of services like ChatGPT. In the fall, Meta chief Zuckerberg said his company was "building the future of human connection." He said that people will soon communicate with <strong>hologram</strong> versions of their friends, coworkers and others. The company demonstrated AI bots using the images of famous people such as Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. Meta believes many social media users will want to interact with <strong>celebrities</strong>.</p>
<p>Enberg, the social media expert, said AI will be used throughout social media platforms. "Social apps will use AI to drive usage, ad performance and <strong>revenues</strong>, <strong>subscription</strong> sign ups," and business activity, she said. Experts say social media services learned from Musk's X that subscriptions are a good way to make money.</p>
<p>Important elections will take place in the United States, India and other places in 2024. Some experts are worried about AI's abilities to create materials that can contain misinformation and then spread on social media.</p>
<p>A.J. Nash is an official with ZeroFox, an internet security company based in the state of Maryland. Nash said materials spread this way will have a "major" influence on elections.</p>
<p>"We're not prepared for this," he said.</p>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Alessandra Zarelli works to keep the artwork of the Vatican Museums in good condition. She says, whenever she works on a masterpiece, she must calm her heart so her thinking can center on her work.</p>
<p>Vatican City is a small country surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. It is the headquarters and seat of government of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican Museums contain thousands of artworks hundreds of years old including paintings by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>"The emotion of working on something like a Michelangelo is truly indescribable," said Zarelli. She helped repair one of his wall paintings in Vatican City's Pauline Chapel.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Restorers Alessandra Zarelli and Rossana Giardina work on paintings at the painting and wood materials restoration laboratory inside the Vatican Museums, at the Vatican, December 11, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/c5bc0212-d6f6-4539-aaf5-b609902737ed_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Restorers Alessandra Zarelli and Rossana Giardina work on paintings at the "painting and wood materials restoration laboratory" inside the Vatican Museums, at the Vatican, December 11, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane)</span></div>
<p>Michelangelo painted during the Renaissance period of European history during a growth of interest in science, art, and literature.</p>
<p>Zarelli is part of a special team at the Vatican Museums' repair laboratory for paintings and wood pieces.</p>
<p>The team is responsible for looking after thousands of square meters of wall paintings, including the famous ceiling and walls of the Sistine Chapel. They also look after some 5,300 oil paintings and wooden statues.</p>
<p><strong>A century of restoration</strong></p>
<p>The painting and wood lab is one of eight specialized groups in the museums. It permitted several news organizations, including Reuters, the chance to see its inner workings to mark its 100th anniversary.</p>
<p>Care and repair methods change often and today's workers often have to repair mistakes from care workers that came before them. They repair work from recent history to many centuries ago.</p>
<p>Another problem, usually from the distant past, is that restorers were not technicians but artists in their own right. Francesca Persegati is chief restorer at the Vatican Museums. She said that some of those artists thought they could "improve" the original by adding their own work.</p>
<p>"It's important to be <strong>humble</strong> in this job, to respect the work but also to have a scientific background to understand the materials," she said.</p>
<p>Before a painting even reaches the lab, another team carries out tests to see if paint or color has been added since the piece was first made. They also check it for possible other work below the surface.</p>
<p>In another part of the lab, Caterina Manisco was working on an 1895 painting called <em>Madonna and Child Between St. Teresa and St. Francis</em>. Italian Emma Richards was the artist. She painted for the rich and powerful, like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Such work was a rarity for women artists of the time.</p>
<p>"Because she was a woman, I somehow feel very close to her," said Manisco, an external restorer at the lab.</p>
<p>To mark the 100th anniversary of the paintings and wood lab, the Vatican Museums are using special technology. It permits visitors to use their phones to connect with information about the artwork they are looking at.</p>

            <title>US Data Shows More Women Live in East, More Men in West  (2023/12/29) | 美国数据显示女性多居东部男性多居西部</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Official population data show more men live in the western United States, while more women live in the East and South.<br/>
官方人口数据显示，更多男性生活在美国西部，而更多女性生活在东部和南部。</p>
<p>The data was collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers appear in the 2022 American Community Survey, released last week. The report gives state and local leaders the latest population and demographic information each year in order to plan investments for their communities.<br/>
这些数据是由美国人口普查局收集的。这些数字出现在上周发布的2022年美国社区调查中。该报告每年向州和地方领导人提供最新的人口数量和人口信息，以便为其社区规划投资。</p>
<p>The report found that women outnumber men in the most populated counties east of the Mississippi River. Women also outnumber men along the U.S. East Coast and in southern states.<br/>
报告发现，在密西西比河以东人口众多的县，女性人数超过男性。美国东海岸和南部各州的女性人数也超过了男性。</p>
<p>The highest population of men was found west of the Mississippi and on the U.S. West Coast.<br/>
密西西比河以西和美国西海岸的男性人口最多。</p>
<p>The American Community Survey found that across the U.S., there were 96.6 adult men for every 100 adult women.<br/>
美国社区调查发现，在美国，成年男性和成年女性的比例是96.6比100。</p>
<p>The report seeks to identify a sex ratio, meaning the number of male and females living in a particular area. The ratio numbers do not consider sexual preference, gender identity or whether people included in the report were looking for partners.<br/>
该报告试图确定一个性别比例，即生活在特定地区的男性和女性人数。该比例数字没有考虑性偏好、性别认同，也没有考虑报告中的人是否在寻找伴侣。</p>
<p>Adult women outnumbered adult men around the eastern cities of Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and Philadelphia.<br/>
东部城市巴尔的摩、纽约、亚特兰大和费城的成年女性人数超过成年男性。</p>
<p>The biggest imbalances of men to women - with ratios above 103 for those age 18 and over - were recorded in the West. The highest ratios were found in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Austin, Texas. Men to women ratios were highest in California, including areas around San Francisco, San Jose and Bakersfield.<br/>
男性与女性之间最大的不平衡发生在西部，其18岁及以上男女比例超过103比100。比例最高的是科罗拉多州的科罗拉多斯普林斯和得克萨斯州的奥斯汀。加利福尼亚州的男女比例最高，包括旧金山、圣何塞和贝克斯菲尔德周围的地区。</p>
<p>Population researchers say the ratios are influenced partly by the presence of certain organizations and industries that appeal more to one sex or the other. San Diego, California, for example, has several large military bases populated with a majority of men. And Austin, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose have a large number of technology companies. Industry groups estimate men make up about three-quarters of the tech workforce.<br/>
人口研究人员表示，这一比例在一定程度上受到某些组织和行业的影响，这些组织和行业对男性或女性更具吸引力。例如，加利福尼亚州的圣地亚哥有几个大型军事基地，那里男性居多。奥斯汀、旧金山、西雅图和圣何塞都有大量的科技公司。行业组织估计，男性约占科技劳动力的四分之三。</p>
<p>At birth, the sex ratio in the U.S. has historically been 105 men for every 100 women. That ratio begins to change around age 30.<br/>
从历史上看，美国出生时的男女性别比例是105比100。这个比例在30岁左右的年龄开始发生变化。</p>
<p>The U.S. death rate is higher for men than it is for women in nearly every age group. Researchers say this is because more men are affected by violence, drinking, smoking, job risks and suicide. But the ratio decreases over time until age 90. Around that age, there are generally two women to every man.<br/>
美国几乎所有年龄段的男性死亡率都高于女性。研究人员表示，这是因为更多的男性受到暴力、饮酒、吸烟、工作风险和自杀的影响。但随着年龄段的推移，这一比例会下降，直到90岁。在90岁左右，通常男女比例为1比2。</p>
<p>Michal Naisteter is a professional matchmaker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A matchmaker is someone who tries to bring two people together for a romantic relationship. She told the Associated Press she sees a difference in where single men and women choose to live. In the Philadelphia area, for example, she says single women are more likely than men to live within the city limits. But single men are more willing to live in areas outside the city, called suburbs.<br/>
Michal Naisteter是宾夕法尼亚州费城的一名职业媒人。媒人是指试图把两个人撮合在一起建立恋爱关系的人。她告诉美联社，她发现单身男女选择生活的地方有所不同。例如，在费城地区，她说单身女性比男性更有可能生活在市区。但单身男性更愿意住在郊区。</p>
<p>Naisteter notes that because of such differences, people looking for a partner need to put in solid, thoughtful efforts to make connections. She suggests that people expand their search areas to include more available singles.<br/>
Naisteter指出，由于这些差异，寻找伴侣的人需要付出坚实、深思熟虑的努力来建立联系。她建议人们扩大搜索范围，以纳入更多可以找到的单身人士。</p>
<p>Such searches "should take work," Naisteter noted. "Because nothing is sweeter than something you have to work for."<br/>
Naisteter指出，这样的搜索“应该会奏效”。“因为没有什么比你必须努力追求伴侣更甜蜜了。”</p>

<span class="byline">By Alice Bryant</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The New Year comes on different dates for different cultures. And most of the Western world celebrates it on January 1st.</p>
<p>One thing many cultures have in common is the idea of New Year's resolutions. A New Year's resolution is a personal goal to change unwanted behavior, make a life improvement, or try something new.</p>
<p>In the United States, popular New Year's resolutions often include losing weight, improving your finances, volunteering for an organization, or spending less time on social media.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar: Grammar and New Year's Resolutions " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-24a1-08dc065fe300_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar: Grammar and New Year's Resolutions </span></div>
<p>On today's Everyday Grammar, we will show you how to talk about resolutions in English.</p>
<p><strong>Asking a question</strong></p>
<p>First, let's learn how to <em>ask</em> people about their resolutions.</p>
<p>Listen to a short <strong>conversation</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Hey there, Faith. Happy New Year! Great to see you.</em></p>
<p><em>Hi, Greg. Happy New Year to you too! How was yours?</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It was crazy! We went to New York and watched the ball drop in Times Square. It was really crowded and loud – but still really fun.</em></p>
<p><em>Sweet! <u>Do you have any New Year's resolutions</u>?</em></p>
<p>Faith asked Greg about <strong>resolutions</strong> simply by saying, "Do you have any New Year's resolutions?"</p>
<p>You can also say, "What are your New Year's resolutions?" to ask about more than one or "What is your New Year's resolution?" to ask about one.</p>
<p>Now, let's find out how to answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Using phrasal verbs</strong></p>
<p>When we make statements about our resolutions, we often use <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>.</p>
<p>We can use the phrasal verb "take up" to say that we will start a new activity as a <strong>hobby</strong>.</p>
<p>Listen to Faith and Greg continue their conversation:</p>
<p><em>Sweet! Do you have any New Year's resolutions?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, I do. I plan to <u>take up</u> kickboxing starting next week. I'm excited to finally do it rather than just talk about it! How about you?</em></p>
<p>Another phrasal verb for resolutions is "give up," which is to stop doing or using something. We can use this verb to talk about ending bad <strong>habits</strong> or changing behavior for a time.</p>
<p>Let's hear Faith respond using the verb "give up":</p>
<p><em>How about you?</em></p>
<p><em>I am <u>giving up</u> sugar for the month of January. Then, for the rest of the year, I'm avoiding soft drinks.</em></p>
<p><em>Wow!<strong> </strong>I wish I could join you but the kickboxing class starts soon. I'll probably want some sweets after class!</em></p>
<p>Another phrasal verb, "cut out," has the same basic meaning as "give up." For example, Faith could say, "I am cutting out sugar for the month of January."</p>
<p>But in many situations, we do not need phrasal verbs to talk about resolutions, as you will soon see.</p>
<p><strong>Using future forms</strong></p>
<p>Next, let's talk about verb <strong>tenses</strong> and forms. Greg talked about his new kickboxing activity using the verb "plan" followed by the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/getting-to-know-gerunds-and-infinitives/3111996.html" target="_blank">infinitive</a> verb form and Faith talked about giving up sugar using the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-present-progressive/3255195.html" target="_blank">present continuous</a> verb tense, also called "BE + ing."</p>
<p>We can also use the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-fun-with-future-tenses/2935173.html" target="_blank">simple future</a> tenses: one with "will" and the other with "going to." These tenses are especially useful when the New Year has not come yet.</p>
<p>Imagine it's the last week of the year and a few people are talking to each other about resolutions: Here are some things you might hear:</p>
<p><em>In 2024, I'<u>m going to visit</u> my friends every month.</em></p>
<p><em>By the end of March, I <u>will stop</u> eating sweets.</em></p>
<p><em>In the new year, I'<u>m going to </u>practice kickboxing every week.</em></p>
<p>When we use simple future tenses to talk about resolutions, we're expressing that we are making a promise to or plan for ourselves. The noun "resolution" comes from the verb "resolve," which means to make a serious decision to do something.</p>
<p><strong>Infinitives and gerunds</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed that the statements so far today did not actually use the word "resolution." That is because the subject was already known by the listeners. But it is still perfectly normal to start your statements with, "My New Year's resolution is..." or "My New Year's resolutions are..." An <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/everyday-grammar-gerunds-infinitives/2722827.html" target="_blank">infinitive verb or a gerund</a> must come after these phrases. Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>My New Year's resolution is <u>to call</u> my sister on video every week.</em></p>
<p>The infinitive verb here is "to call."</p>
<p>You can also use a gerund, like this:</p>
<p><em>My New Year's resolution is <u>calling</u> my sister on video every week.</em></p>
<p>Well, that's all for today's program. Tell us about your New Year's resolutions in the comments below. Or email us at learningenglish@voanews.com.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>I'm Jill Robbins.</p>
<p><em>Alice Bryant wrote this lesson for Learning English. </em></p>

            <title>Top Technology Stories of 2023  (2023/12/28)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">27 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The past year <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/a-big-year-for-artificial-intelligence/7403954.html">marked the rise</a> of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools. But here is a look back at some of the other noteworthy technology stories we covered in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Google, Apple face major legal challenges</strong></p>
<p>Both Apple and Google faced lawsuits accusing them of carrying out unfair business methods linked to their <strong>app</strong> stores. The cases might cost the companies billions of dollars and change the way similar app stores do business.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Google logo displayed at the company's European headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2010." src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/C9423EC6-B00F-4264-A935-198256C8807E_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Google logo displayed at the company's European headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2010.</span></div>
<p>A decision in the Google case was reached earlier this month when an American jury <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/jury-rules-google-app-store-operates-as-monopoly/7396589.html">found</a> Google's app store operates as an illegal <strong>monopoly</strong>. The case was brought by video game company Epic Games.</p>
<p>One of the main questions in the case was whether Google had the right to require app developers to use Google's app store's payment systems. The jury ruled Google's monopoly covered both its app selling system and payment processing within the app. Google condemned the decision and appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Epic brought a similar lawsuit against iPhone maker Apple that was decided in April. In that case, a judge in California mostly sided with Apple. But the judge did order Apple to permit developers to add their own links to process payments within iPhone apps.</p>
<p><strong>EV battery technology and production</strong></p>
<p>The worldwide demand for electric vehicle (EV) <strong>batteries</strong> continues to grow. But supplies of the materials used to make them are limited. Currently, China controls most mining and processing of a group of 17 metals known as rare earths.</p>
<p>One of the main materials used to produce the batteries is lithium, a light metal substance. Other necessary materials include the metallic elements cobalt, manganese and nickel. Even though some of the minerals are mined in nations outside China, Chinese companies still hold ownership over the operations.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid a dependence on Chinese controlled materials, the United States and other countries are <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/demand-for-electric-car-batteries-drives-nations-to-seek-own-materials/6526662.html">seeking to mine and process more materials at home</a>.</p>
<p>In February, U.S. President Joe Biden announced federal assistance programs to help companies mine and process lithium and other rare metals. Similar efforts were announced in other countries, including Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>In addition, major automakers said they were <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/automakers-seek-to-produce-ev-vehicles-with-fewer-rare-earths/7362904.html">seeking new EV engine designs</a> that are less dependent on rare earth minerals. EV market leader Tesla said it plans to remove rare earths from its next-generation EVs. Other automakers said they are in the process of researching or developing EV motors that use little or no rare earth minerals. These include General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, and BMW.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic developments</strong></p>
<p>We covered several developments involving robotic systems.</p>
<p>A team of American researchers <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/soccer-playing-robot-set-to-compete-in-robo-cup-/7064373.html">announced</a> it had built a human-like robot that can play soccer at a high level. The robot, named ARTEMIS, is one of only a few humanoid robots that can run. It also can walk and jump on different kinds of surfaces without losing its balance. The robot also can kick a ball and remain standing even when kicked or hit, the team said.</p>
<p>In Germany, many companies – large and small – <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/german-companies-turn-to-robots-to-fill-jobs-for-retiring-workers/7332773.html">turned to robots</a> to fill jobs as the country faced a severe labor shortage. The International Federation of Robotics estimated that about 26,000 robotic machines were put into use in Germany last year. Experts say increasing robotic operations are a sign that robots have become easier to use, with no special skills required.</p>
<p>However, the risks of using machines in the workplace <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/industrial-robot-crushes-worker-in-south-korea/7348375.html">were demonstrated</a> in South Korea, where an industrial robot crushed a worker to death at a vegetable processing center. Police said the victim was an employee of a company that deploys industrial robots to businesses.</p>
<p>NASA even <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/nasa-tests-snake-like-robot-to-search-for-life-in-the-solar-system/7099496.html">tested</a> a snake-like explorer designed to search for signs of life in hard-to-reach places. The American space agency said the robot is equipped to move in ways that traditional explorer vehicles, called rovers, cannot. In the future, NASA plans to send the robot to space to search for signs of life in an underground ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus.</p>

<span class="datetime">27 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The Endangered <strong>Species</strong> Act had widespread support when President Richard Nixon signed it into law late in 1973. In the 50 years since, the effects of the legislation have been both successful and complex.</p>
<p>Most Americans celebrated the law that helped save animals such as the bald eagle and bison. But when the law stood in the way of economic progress, many questioned whether it was too strong.</p>
<p>The act took effect around the same time as other laws designed to protect natural resources such as water, air and the wilderness. In the 1960s and 1970s, no other country in the world had put such wide protections into place.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A California condor named Hope takes to flight at the Condor habitat at the Los Angeles Zoo, Tuesday, May 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7c914db5-7b6b-4a57-8442-72f37d8e1647_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A California condor named Hope takes to flight at the Condor habitat at the Los Angeles Zoo, Tuesday, May 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)</span></div>
<p>Concerns came later when the law prevented projects such as a hydroelectric dam in Tennessee from moving forward. The concern? A small river fish no one had ever heard of.</p>
<p>That fish is called the snail darter. Plans to protect the fish held up progress on the Tellico Dam for more than two years. Biologists eventually decided to catch the small fish and move it to other rivers.</p>
<p>The fish population grew over time and the snail darters were removed from the endangered species list in 1984. About one year ago, the fish had fully recovered.</p>
<p>Jim Williams was the first so-called "fish guy" in the Office of Endangered Species. When his group listed the fish, he recalled, the decision made a lot of people upset.</p>
<p>He said his director told him not to list the fish. But Williams said he planned to follow the law and make decisions based on facts, not on possible public reaction.</p>
<p>The snail darter decision showed the U.S. government that the law was going to be difficult to <strong>manage</strong>. Some said the government should not try to save all species. Others said all animals and plants should be safe from extinction. The debate continues today.</p>
<p>Many more disputes over the protection of species came up over the next 45 years. In each case, employees at the Endangered Species Office made decisions that upset some people but ultimately saved the animals.</p>
<p><strong>Gray wolves</strong></p>
<p>In northern Minnesota in the 1980s, the gray wolf population had recovered from only around a few hundred to about 1,000. The Endangered Species Act had helped save the gray wolf.</p>
<p>With the population growing, people wanted permission to hunt the animals. The Fish and Wildlife Service sought to cooperate with the state of Minnesota and open the gray wolf to hunting.</p>
<p>The move required a <strong>regulation</strong> showing that a hunting season would help the wolves and was the only way to control their population.</p>
<p>Ron Nowak was a wolf expert in the Endangered Species Office at the time. The Fish and Wildlife Service told Nowak to write the regulation. "And I said, ‘It would be illegal,'" Nowak said.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service found someone else to write the regulation. <strong>Conservation</strong> groups took legal action and called Nowak as a witness. He traveled to Minnesota to tell the government that wolves should not be open to hunting.</p>
<p><strong>California condor</strong></p>
<p>LaVerne Smith started working in the Endangered Species Office in 1978. Soon after came a major decision involving the California condor, the largest bird native to North America. By 1982, only 23 California condors were left. Biologists were looking at whether the species could be saved.</p>
<p>The office made a plan to move the remaining birds into a safe and closed area and <strong>breed</strong> them.</p>
<p>The plan worked. Today, there are more than 400 California condors. They can even be seen flying over the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Smith said, "the day I saw one sail over the Grand Canyon, I was like, ‘Oh my God! That was all worth it.'"</p>
<p>Later in her career, Smith led the effort to list the polar bear as endangered. It marked the first time an animal was listed as endangered because of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Freshwater mussels</strong></p>
<p>Marc Imlay began working at the Endangered Species Office in 1971, two years before the current Endangered Species Act was passed.</p>
<p>Imlay is an expert on mollusks – small animals including snails, mussels and slugs. He had concerns that hydroelectric dams were putting freshwater mussels in danger in states such as Missouri and Tennessee.</p>
<p>At one point, Imlay decided to make a phone call to a conservation group in Missouri to tell them that a planned dam would put the mussels in danger.</p>
<p>The call worked. He got locals to pay attention to the organism and the dam was stopped. In time, his work prevented a number of dams from being built.</p>
<p>While some could argue that Imlay slowed economic progress, he said in other cases he found a way to help development move forward.</p>
<p>"Time and time again," he said, "you can work with a developer" to save high-quality land.</p>

<p>Bahara Rustam is 13 years old. She took her last class at Bibi Razia School in Kabul, Afghanistan, on December 11 knowing it was the end of her education. Under Afghan law, she is unlikely to ever step foot in a classroom again.</p>
<p>In September 2021, the country's ruling Taliban announced that females would be barred from education after sixth grade, or about age 13. The government said it was acting in line with Islamic religious law.</p>
<p>The United States and NATO troops had withdrawn from Afghanistan a month earlier, after 20 years of war.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Afghan girls attend a religious school, which remained open since the last year's Taliban takeover, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 11, 2022.

(AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File)</span></div>
<p>In December 2022, the restrictive measure was expanded to include university education.</p>
<p>The international community has continued to condemn the Taliban for the actions. Countries have warned the Taliban that it its actions will bar it from gaining international recognition as a lawful government.</p>
<p>Last week, United Nations special diplomat for Afghanistan Roza Otunbayeva appeared before the UN Security Council. She said she worried that a generation of Afghan girls is falling behind with each day that passes.</p>
<p>An Afghan Education Ministry said last week that girls of all ages are permitted to study in religious schools called madrassas. They have traditionally been boys-only.</p>
<p>The UN is trying to confirm the ministry's statement. But Otunbayeva said it was unclear if that education system included wider study of non-religious subjects.</p>
<p>For now, Bahara is holding onto her education and looks over school books at home. "<strong>Graduating</strong> (from sixth grade) means we are going to seventh grade," she said. "But all of our classmates cried and we were very <strong>disappointed</strong>," she added.</p>
<p>There was no graduation ceremony for the girls at Bibi Razia School.</p>
<p>In another part of Kabul, 13-year old Setayesh Sahibzada wonders what the future holds for her. She is sad she cannot go to school anymore to follow her dreams.</p>
<p>"I can't stand on my own two feet," she said. "I wanted to be a teacher. But now I can't study, I can't go to school."</p>
<p>Researcher Muhammad Saleem Paigir warned that banning women and girls from education would be disastrous for Afghanistan. "We understand that<strong> illiterate</strong> people can never be free and<strong> prosperous</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>The Taliban have banned women from many public spaces and most jobs, all but keeping women inside their homes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>For better or for worse, the number of couples getting married in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, on New Year's Eve could set a record.<br/>
不管是好是坏，内华达州拉斯维加斯市新年前夕结婚的夫妇数量都可能创下纪录。</p>
<p>That is because the date 12/31/23 is known in the Las Vegas wedding industry as a "specialty date." The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the repeating number pattern of 1-2-3 1-2-3 is very popular.<br/>
这是因为2023年12月31日（12/31/23）这天在拉斯维加斯婚礼行业被称为“特色日期”。《拉斯维加斯评论杂志》报道称，1-2-3 1-2-3的重复数型非常受欢迎。</p>
<p>What makes it even more special is that the date falls on a holiday famous for big celebrations.<br/>
更特别的是，这一天恰逢一个以大型庆祝活动闻名的节日。</p>
<p>"It's a double whammy," said Melody Willis-Williams, president of Vegas Weddings, which owns several wedding venues. "Anytime you get these specialty dates, they're always hugely popular. But tie that in with New Year's Eve and it's a showstopper."<br/>
“这是双重冲击，”拉斯维加斯婚礼公司总裁梅洛迪·威利斯-威廉姆斯说，该公司拥有多个婚礼场地。“每当遇到这些特色日期时，它们总是非常受欢迎。但把它与新年前夕联系起来，它就会引人注目。”</p>
<p>Las Vegas is famous for fast marriage ceremonies, and many marriages take place there every year.<br/>
拉斯维加斯以快速举行婚礼而闻名，每年都有许多婚礼在那里举行。</p>
<p>The number to beat on New Year's Eve is 4,492. That is the single-day record for marriages in Las Vegas set on July 7, 2007. The second-most popular specialty wedding date on record with the county's marriage bureau is November 11, 2011, when 3,125 couples married.<br/>
新年前夕要打败的数字是4492。这是拉斯维加斯2007年7月7日创下的单日结婚记录。2011年11月11日是该县婚姻局有记录以来第二受欢迎的特色婚礼日期，当时有3125对新人结婚。</p>
<p>Since 2018, somewhere between 450 and 550 marriage ceremonies take place each year in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, the Review-Journal reported.<br/>
据《拉斯维加斯评论杂志》报道，自2018年以来，拉斯维加斯每年新年前夕都会举行450至550场婚礼。</p>
<p>This year, the company Vegas Weddings is fully booked for midnight at all its venues, including a church in downtown Las Vegas.<br/>
今年，拉斯维加斯婚礼公司的所有场地，包括拉斯维加斯市中心一座教堂在内午夜时段都被预订一空。</p>
<p>Willis-Williams said her company expects to marry more than 120 couples on New Year's Eve. Five of those couples will marry as the clock is counting down to midnight.<br/>
威利斯-威廉姆斯说，她的公司预计在新年前夕将有120多对新人结婚。其中五对将在新年倒计时的时候结婚。</p>
<p>Clark County Clerk Lynn Marie Goya said couples married on a specialty date in Las Vegas have described them as "magic dates" that are easy to remember.<br/>
克拉克县办事员林恩·玛丽·戈雅说，在拉斯维加斯特色日期结婚的夫妇将它们称为非常容易记住的神奇日期。</p>
<p>"I think the celebration that has a group dynamic is really appealing," Goya said. "When everyone is in line and they're all getting married and excited about being in love, it just enhances their own experience."<br/>
戈雅说：“我认为具有团体活力的庆祝活动真的很有吸引力。当每个人排着队，他们都将结婚，并对陷入爱河感到兴奋时，这只会增强他们自己的体验。”</p>

<span class="datetime">26 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>California officials recently approved new rules to let water agencies <strong>recycle</strong> wastewater and put it right back into the pipes that carry drinking water to homes, schools, and businesses.</p>
<p>It is a big step for California. The state has struggled for many years to secure drinking water for more than 39 million people. It shows a change in public opinion on a subject that as recently as twenty years ago was met with criticism and ended similar projects.</p>
<p>Since then, California has been through several extreme <strong>droughts</strong>. That includes the most recent one that scientists say was the driest three-year period on record. And it left the state's water supply at dangerously low levels.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Lakeisha Bryant, public information representative at the Santa Clara Valley Water District, holds flasks of water before and after it is purified at the Silicon Valley Advance Purification Center on December 13, 2023, in San Jose, California.

<p>"Water is so <strong>precious</strong> in California. It is important that we use it more than once," said Jennifer West. She is director of WateReuse California, a group that supports recycled water.</p>
<p>California has been using recycled wastewater for many years. A team has used it to make ice surfaces for the game of hockey. It has been used to make snow for the sport of skiing. And farmers use it to water their crops.</p>
<p>But it has not been used directly for drinking water. Orange County, a suburban area of Los Angeles, operates a water cleaning system that recycles wastewater and then uses it to refill underground <strong>aquifers</strong>. That water then mixes with the groundwater for months before being pumped up and used for drinking water again.</p>
<p>California's new rules would let – but not require – water agencies to take wastewater, treat it, and then put it right back into the drinking water system. California would be just the second U.S. state to permit this, following Colorado.</p>
<p>It has taken officials more than 10 years to develop these rules, a process that included several studies by independent groups of scientists. A state law required the California Water Resources Control Board to approve these rules by December 31. It was met with just a few days left.</p>
<p>The vote was met with approval by some of the state's biggest water agencies. All of which have plans to build huge water recycling plants in the coming years.</p>
<p>A project in San Diego is aiming to produce nearly half of the city's water through recycling water by 2035. And the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California aims to produce up to nearly 570 million liters a day for its 19 million people. Adel Hagekhalil is with Metropolitan Water. He said the new rules will permit new projects that have not yet been considered.</p>
<p>Water agencies will need public support to complete these projects. That means proving to people that recycled water is not only safe to drink but also not dirty.</p>
<p>California's new rules require the wastewater be treated for all bacteria and viruses, even if they are not present in the wastewater. That is different from regular water treatment rules, which only require treatment for known diseases, said Darrin Polhemus. He is a director of the drinking water group for the California Water Resources Control Board.</p>
<p>In fact, the treatment is so intense it removes all of the minerals that make fresh drinking water taste good. That means the minerals need to be added back at the end of the process.</p>
<p>"It's at the same drinking water quality, and probably better in many <strong>instances</strong>," Polhemus said.</p>
<p>Polhemus added that it takes time and money to build these treatment centers. So, they will only be available for bigger cities at first.</p>

<p>In the third full school year since the COVID-19 pandemic began, students continued to feel the effects of school closures. Some leading experts and education officials worry that the learning loss caused by the pandemic may be long-term.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, many students are missing school. <strong>Chronic</strong> <strong>absenteeism</strong> is becoming more common at school <strong>districts</strong> around the country. Some students went missing from the attendance rolls during the pandemic and have never been accounted for.</p>
<p>And in a year of growing artificial intelligence technology, AI has also entered the classroom. Some schools have banned the use of chatbots like ChatGPT. Other teachers are using the new technology to help students, hoping they use the technology in <strong>appropriate</strong> ways.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Jenes Ochoa Rojas goes over the lines of a three-scene play written by ChatGPT in Donnie Piercey's class at Stonewall Elementary in Lexington, Ky., Monday, Feb. 6, 2023.&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;160; (AP Photo/Timothy D.

Easley)</span></div>
<p>Here is a look at the big issues that shaped education in 2023 and will shape education in the year to come.</p>
<p><strong>Continued learning loss </strong></p>
<p>In June, the U.S. Department of Education released the scores from a national math and reading test that is given to 13-year-olds. About 8,700 students took the test in both math and reading in late 2022.</p>
<p>The results showed a drop of nine points in math and four points in reading compared to 2020, the last year the test was administered. The department's information shows that those are the largest point decreases between tests recorded since 1973.</p>
<p>The test asks students to read short <strong>passages</strong> and identify the main idea or some facts. In math, students had to answer simple multiplication and geometry questions.</p>
<p>The latest test scores show that American 13-year-old students are back to their lowest level in math since 1990 and lowest reading level since 2004.</p>
<p>Math and Reading scores were no better outside the U.S. Students around the world suffered historic setbacks in reading and math. That information comes from results of the latest Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).</p>
<p>The PISA is an international comparative study of the scores of 15-year-old students on tests in reading, math and science. It is administered by OECD. Nearly 700,000 students worldwide took part in the study.</p>
<p>PISA is given every three years. The latest results showed an "<strong>unprecedented</strong> drop in performance" since 2018. The 2022 results were released on December 5. It is the first extensive study with data on how the pandemic has affected student performance around the world.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a major reason for the worldwide score drops. But science and reading scores were dropping even before the pandemic. This suggests there are other reasons for the decrease.</p>
<p>Factors such as the level of investment in education, the social value and pay levels of teachers, and educational beliefs of students have all influenced educational results, OECD found.</p>
<p><strong>Absent, missing students</strong></p>
<p>Students are not going to make gains in learning if they miss school. Education officials and activists are concerned about an increase in the number of students who are absent for many days during the school year.</p>
<p>Education policy experts call the problem "chronic absenteeism." Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing more than 10 percent out of the days in a school year.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why students miss a lot of school. Certain physical problems and mental health problems, which have increased since the pandemic, are possible causes.</p>
<p>Certain community conditions also can affect attendance, says Joshua Childs, a professor of education policy at the University of Texas at Austin. These include whether a student has safe transportation to and from school and whether the school itself is a safe environment. Childs added that if families do not feel connected with the school community or do not value education that can add to absenteeism.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of American students have also dropped out of public schools since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have essentially gone missing from schools.</p>
<p>A recent examination found an estimated 240,000 students in 21 states whose absences from school could not be explained. These students did not move out of state. They also did not sign up for private school or home-school.</p>
<p>The issue of missing students received a lot of attention in 2020 after the pandemic closed schools around the country. In the years since, however, the issue has largely become a budgeting problem.</p>
<p>There is no longer urgency to find the students who disappeared from school. Early in the pandemic, school workers would go to the students' homes to try and help them return to the classroom. Most of those efforts have ended.</p>
<p><strong>Changing technology</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic showed how useful digital technology could be for schools. But it also showed the limitations of technology in the educational setting. Millions of students were able to attend classes online and avoid spreading the virus. But many students failed to learn by such methods.</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( or UNESCO) argues against unsupervised wide use of digital tools and AI in education. A recent UNESCO report says there is little evidence that wide technology use improves learning.</p>
<p>The organization says digital educational tools can never replace the human connection of teacher and student. There is a very large divide, or gap, between rich and poor countries when it comes to digital resources</p>
<p>"Even if connectivity was <strong>universal</strong>, it would still be necessary to demonstrate ...that digital technology offers real added value in terms of effective learning," the UNESCO report says.</p>
<p>Many educators fear students will use the AI tool ChatGPT to write their reports or <strong>cheat</strong> on homework. New York City school officials started blocking the writing tool on school devices and networks in January. But other teachers are including it in the classroom.</p>
<p>Donnie Piercey is a teacher in Lexington, Kentucky. He told his fifth-grade students to try and outsmart the tool that was creating writing <strong>assignments</strong>. Piercey says his job is to prepare students for a world where knowledge of AI will be required.</p>
<p>He describes ChatGPT as just the latest technology in his 17 years of teaching that raised concerns about the possibility of cheating. Other tools include Google, Wikipedia and YouTube.</p>
<p>"As educators, we haven't <strong>figured</strong> out the best way to use artificial intelligence yet," he added. "But it's coming, whether we want it to or not."</p>

            <title>Saudi Arabia's Involvement in Sports Likely to Grow in 2024  (2023/12/27) | 沙特金元体育2024年可能继续大杀四方</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202312/saudi-arabia-s-involvement-in-sports-likely-to-grow-in-2024.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">
<p>At the beginning of 2023, Saudi Arabia's growing influence on professional golf, and sports in general, was a concern for players and their fans.<br/>
2023年初，沙特阿拉伯对职业高尔夫和整个体育运动的影响力越来越大，这引起了球员及其球迷的忧虑。</p>
<p>Twelve months later, discussions are very different. Worries about the supposed threat of "sportswashing" - using sports to improve a country's reputation – have declined. Concerns about moral issues - the line between "right" and "wrong" - have also gone down. Attention now is fixed on just how rich the Saudis might make the athletes.<br/>
12个月后，议论情况大不相同。人们对所谓的“体育洗白”（利用体育运动来提高国家声誉）威胁的担忧有所减少。对道德问题，即“对”和“错”之间界限的担忧也有所下降。现在，人们的注意力集中在沙特人可能会让运动员变得多么富有上。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What has changed?<br/>
发生了什么变化？</span></p>
<p>Two major events caused the change. On June 6, the PGA Tour announced it was looking to go into business with the Saudi group that was paying for the kingdom's LIV Golf, which the tour had labeled as a threat.<br/>
两件大事导致了这一变化。6月6日，美国职业高尔夫球巡回赛宣布，它正寻求与赞助LIV Golf的沙特组织开展业务，该巡回赛曾称其为威胁。</p>
<p>Then, six months later, Jon Rahm, the world's third-ranked professional golfer and an early resister of LIV, decided to join LIV for a deal reported to be worth about $500 million.<br/>
六个月后，世界排名第三的职业高尔夫球手、LIV的早期抵制者琼·拉姆决定加入LIV，据报道这笔交易价值约5亿美元。</p>
<p>Other important events included the continuing talks between the Saudis and leaders of professional tennis organizations. In addition, the push into soccer will bring the world's biggest sporting event, the World Cup, to Saudi Arabia in 2034.<br/>
其他重要活动包括沙特人与职业网球组织领导人之间的持续会谈。此外，进军足球将在2034年为沙特阿拉伯带来世界上最大的体育赛事世界杯。</p>
<p>
Dan Durbin is director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at the University of Southern California (USC). Durbin said of the Saudi plans: "You're investing in sports, which is one of the few growth industries in the world....It is, as far as we can see, an almost endless growth industry."<br/>
丹·德宾是南加州大学体育、媒体和社会研究所所长。德宾在谈到沙特的计划时说：“投资体育是世界上为数不多的增长型行业之一……就我们所见，这是一个几乎增长无止境的产业。”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saudi's investments<br/>
沙特的投资</span></p>
<p>In early 2022, the discussion about golf centered on Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, in LIV Golf. At the time, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson made a critical comment about Saudi Arabia related to the murder of the Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi.<br/>
2022年初，关于高尔夫的讨论集中在沙特阿拉伯公共投资基金对LIV golf的投资上。当时，六届大满贯得主菲尔·米克尔森就沙特卷入《华盛顿邮报》作家贾迈勒·卡舒吉的谋杀案发表了批评性评论。</p>
<p>Mickelson's comment set the dividing line in what was viewed as a moral question. And the discussion ignored how important Saudi Arabia is in the world economy. The Saudis gain much of their importance by supplying around 15 percent of the world's petroleum.<br/>
米克尔森的评论划下了一个道德问题的分界线。这些讨论忽略了沙特阿拉伯在世界经济中的重要性。沙特通过供应全球约15%的石油而获得了很大的重要性。</p>
<p>Besides golf, the fund offered one of soccer's biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo, $200 million to join a Saudi team. And it also owns the Premier League's Newcastle soccer club.<br/>
除了高尔夫，该基金还出资2亿美元邀请足球巨星克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多加盟了沙特球队。它还拥有英超联赛的纽卡斯尔足球俱乐部。</p>
<p>As the calendar turns to 2024, there is no sign of Saudi involvement in sports slowing. The Saudis are hosting a Formula One auto race. They are also looking to invest some $5 billion into cricket's Indian Premier League with an eye on making it bigger in other countries.<br/>
随着日历转到2024年，沙特对体育运动的参与没有放缓的迹象。沙特正在举办一场一级方程式赛车比赛。他们还希望向印度板球超级联赛投资约50亿美元，为的是扩大该项运动在其它国家的规模。</p>
<p>The ATP, which runs men's professional tennis, has a five-year deal to hold one of its biggest events in the Saudi port city of Jeddah. Talks between the Saudis and the women's tour are reportedly ongoing.<br/>
经营男子职业网球的职业网球联合会签订了一份为期五年的协议，它将在沙特港口城市吉达举办其最大的赛事之一。据报道，沙特和女子职业网球巡回赛之间的谈判正在进行中。</p>
<p>In a sign of how public discussions have changed, Billie Jean King, who fought for equal pay for women in sports, has said bringing women's tennis to the kingdom might not be all bad despite its poor record on women's rights.<br/>
比莉·让·金曾为女性在体育运动中的同工同酬而奋斗，她表示，尽管沙特在女权方面的记录不佳，但将女子网球带到沙特可能并不完全是坏事，这表明公众讨论已经发生了变化。</p>
<p>"I don't think you really change unless you engage," she said earlier this year.<br/>
她今年早些时候说：“我不认为你真的会改变，除非你参与进来。”</p>
<p>Durbin says sports is a way for the kingdom to be seen as more than an oil-producer with a bad human-rights record.<br/>
德宾说，体育运动是沙特被视为不仅仅是一个人权记录不佳的石油生产国的途径。</p>
<p>"For decades, sports has been the center of soft diplomacy," he said. "You try to create a positive response and feeling about your ethics because you're holding to the rules of sports."<br/>
他说：“几十年来，体育一直是软外交的中心。各国试图对自己的道德标准做出积极的回应和感受，因为你坚持体育规则。”</p>

            <title>Millions Infected with Dengue as Temperature Rises  (2023/12/26)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The disease dengue is spreading across the Western Hemisphere in numbers not seen since record-keeping began in 1980. Experts are warning that rising temperatures and growing cities are increasing the rate of infection.</p>
<p>More than 4 million cases have been reported throughout the Americas and the Caribbean so far this year, breaking a record set in 2019. Officials from the Bahamas to Brazil are warning of crowded health centers and new infections daily. Reports say there have been more than 2,000 deaths across the wide area.</p>
<p>Thais dos Santos is with the Pan American Health Organization, the area office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Americas. She said diseases like dengue, "provide us a really good <strong>sentinel</strong> of what is happening with climate change."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Children with dengue wait to be seen by doctors at the Mario Ortiz Children's Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Feb. 16, 2023. (AP Photo/Ipa Ibanez,File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-c907-08dbffd9834e_cx7_cy0_cw86_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Children with dengue wait to be seen by doctors at the Mario Ortiz Children's Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Feb. 16, 2023.

<p>A lack of good <strong>sanitation</strong> and strong health systems have added to the rise in cases. But experts say <strong>droughts</strong> and floods linked to climate change are causing greater spread of the virus. That is because stored water and heavy rains appeal to mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey is chief of the dengue branch for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Puerto Rico. She noted that higher temperatures also are expanding the mosquito's habitat and helping the virus develop faster inside the mosquito. That leads to higher viral loads and a higher chance of transmission.</p>
<p>This year's Northern Hemisphere summer was the hottest ever, with August about 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial period averages. And Copernicus, the European climate service, reported that 2023 is the second hottest year on record.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 4.5 million cases of dengue had been reported as of early November. There have been more than 4,000 deaths reported in 80 countries.</p>
<p>Countries like Bangladesh are seeing a record number of cases and deaths. The government in the South Asian country has reported more than 313,700 cases and more than 1,600 deaths. Most of the deaths happened within three days of hospitalization.</p>
<p>The mosquito that carries dengue also has been identified in 22 European countries, with local spread of the disease seen in France, Italy and Spain. In August, the central African country of Chad reported its first dengue outbreak in history.</p>
<p>Dengue affects some 129 countries, with roughly half the world's population at risk, says the WHO. Infected female mosquitoes pass the virus when they feed on animals. The sickness can cause severe headaches, fever, vomiting, rash and other signs. While most infected people do not get symptoms, severe cases can lead to <strong>plasma</strong> leakage and death.</p>
<p>What is worse, experts say, repeated infections means a higher risk of developing severe dengue.</p>
<p>The Caribbean also is battling an increase in cases. The area had reported a 15 percent increase in confirmed cases by early October compared with the same period last year, says the Caribbean Public Health Agency.</p>
<p>Officials on the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique declared an epidemic in August that is still ongoing. Martinique is reporting an average of 800 cases a week on the island of some 394,000 people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jamaica and the Bahamas declared an outbreak in September followed by Barbados in October.</p>
<p>Poor countries struggle the most with dengue. Bad sanitation creates a good reproduction environment for infected mosquitoes. Poor housing conditions leave people at greater risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Dengue outbreaks can crush already poor and overworked health systems.</p>
<p>Jeremy Farra is chief scientist for the WHO. He said dengue is very difficult to treat partly because patients often delay in seeking medical care. The virus can progress so quickly, he said. Treating those with the disease requires very close patient supervision and a lot of time.</p>
<p>Farra said, "Imagine that you have a thousand people like that requiring all that <strong>delicate</strong> clinical care. It can very quickly <strong>overwhelm</strong> a system."</p>

            <title>What White House Gardens Say about America  (2023/12/26)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The earliest presidents who lived in the White House did not want the large outdoor areas that the <strong>monarchs</strong> of Europe might enjoy.</p>
<p>Marta McDowell is writer of <em>All the Presidents' Gardens. </em>She said, "You can understand that, given our democratic form of government." But she said she thinks that a visit to the home of the British royal family, Buckingham Palace, caused President John Kennedy to expand the White House <strong>gardens</strong>.</p>
<p>From the start, presidents and their families influenced the 7.2 hectares of open space in the front and back of the White House differently. Their choices often showed their values and traditions of their day.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A view of the restored Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, Saturday, Aug. 22, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-637d-08dbfcd82e88_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A view of the restored Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, Saturday, Aug. 22, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)</span></div>
<p>McDowell said that the White House is "really their home" while they are in office. She added that as long as they work with the historic plan of the gardens the National Park Service tries to meet the desires of the administration. The National Park Service oversees the gardens.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams, America's sixth president, worked in the garden. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, took down glass structures called greenhouses that were first built by James Buchanan, the 15th president, in the 1850s.</p>
<p>John Kennedy, the 35th president, redesigned one garden called the Rose Garden in the 1960s. First lady Michelle Obama, wife of the 44th president, built a food garden using plants and seeds from the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president. Today, the garden has more than 50 kinds of vegetables.</p>
<p>Pierre L'Enfant was the city planner and <strong>architect</strong> for America's first president, George Washington. At first, he planned for a 30-hectare presidential garden. However, as a believer in small government, Jefferson reduced the White House grounds to just 2 hectares. The gardens were expanded to the current 7.2 hectares</p>
<p>Jefferson, like many Americans who had just freed themselves from a British monarch, was concerned about creating a new <strong>king</strong>.</p>
<p>"Avoid <strong>palaces</strong> and gardens of palaces," William Thornton, a Washington city representative warned. "If you build a palace with gardens, I will find you a king."</p>
<p>Over time, several different plants and flowers were planted at the White House. They include roses which have been around since at least Jefferson's time. They also include peonies, wanted by first lady first lady Nancy Reagan of the 40th president, and Texas bluebells, asked for by first lady Laura Bush of the 43rd president.</p>
<p>Oak and elm trees have also been on the White House grounds almost since the beginning. One tree, a chestnut oak southeast of the White House, might be the oldest tree on the grounds. The White House says it has been around since 1800.</p>
<p>McDowell says the White House gardens represent gardening tradition over time. First it followed designs in Europe, and then it was shaped by local traditions, the area, and the climate.</p>
<p>But she said, "It's not that they are always the leader. In fact, sometimes they're following."</p>
<p>The White house grounds were open to the public up until 1923. That was when Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president, permanently closed them to unapproved visitors.</p>
<p>These days, the White House Garden planned visits for the public are usually available for the public twice a year, one weekend in the spring and again in autumn.</p>
<p>McDowell said, "They are full of tradition. They're full of beauty."</p>

<p>The Rohingya girl from Myanmar wanted to do anything she could to provide some money for her parents and three younger siblings. They needed food.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old and her family are members of the Muslim minority in Myanmar. The group is always in danger of attack by government forces and others there.</p>
<p>Last year, the girl, M, agreed to marry a man in Malaysia who promised to send about $4,000 to her family.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rohingya refugee, S, age 16, stands in the hallway of a friend's home in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Oct. 6, 2023.

<p>She and all the girls in this report are identified by only the first letter of their names for their safety.</p>
<p>M told the <em>Associated Press</em> she was not ready for marriage. But she had an urgent need to help her family.</p>
<p>Now, a year later in Kuala Lumpur, her 35-year-old husband rapes her almost every night.</p>
<p>M's experience is not unusual, the <em>AP</em> reports.</p>
<p>Many underage girls are now in Malaysia living in forced marriages to older men.</p>
<p>The girls say conditions for Rohingya in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh were very bad. Soldiers and others were raping and killing people. Others had their homes burned and property stolen. Malaysia seemed like a possibility for a safer life.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult journey</strong></p>
<p>The AP interviewed 13 Rohingya for the report. All had arrived in Malaysia since 2022. The youngest girl was 13. They all say they feel like hostages. They are rarely permitted outside their homes. They say they are not prepared to be mothers. About half are pregnant and some have children already.</p>
<p>The path to flee the refugee camps or Myanmar is dangerous. Some try crossing the Andaman Sea by boat although many die on the long trip. The United Nations said most Rohingya who survived the crossing this year were women and children.</p>
<p>The people who take the girls on dangerous trips to Malaysia are called traffickers. The girls are crowded onto boats and vehicles for the trip. There is little food. The traffickers also rape and beat the girls.</p>
<p>When M arrived in Malaysia, the man she was to marry called for the ceremony to take place at once. M was still bleeding from the rapes she suffered on her journey. A person who helps the Rohingya girls took her to a hospital for care.</p>
<p>When M got home, she found out the man who was now her husband already had a wife and two children. M does not tell her parents what happened to her. She thinks it might cause her husband to stop sending monthly payments to her family.</p>
<p><strong>Pain and unwanted pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Another girl, D, is in the same situation. She is 13. She plays with a little toy whale as she talks. She wants to play outside or visit a market nearby. But, her husband does not permit her to leave the home. She is forced to have sex every day. She does not want a baby, but she knows there is a good chance she will get pregnant.</p>
<p>"I want to run," D said.</p>
<p>R is 16. She has a newborn. She is one of several girls in a building filled with child <strong>brides</strong> who now have their own children. You can hear the babies crying.</p>
<p>She said life as a refugee in Bangladesh was difficult. But, as one of 11 children in her family, she was never lonely there. She had no one in Malaysia except her husband. She would be alone all day while he was at work.</p>
<p>R gave birth recently. "When I saw my baby's face, I was happy, because now I have a friend," she told the <em>AP</em>.</p>
<p>However, being a mother is not easy. She said she does not know how to be a mother.</p>
<p>"I miss my mom," she said. "I want my parents."</p>
<p>S is pregnant and homeless. Her Malaysian husband forced her to leave when he found out she was pregnant. Without a job, S walks the streets of Kuala Lumpur asking strangers for money.</p>
<p>"I once dreamed of having a happy family," S says. "I don't dream much anymore."</p>

<p>NASA has discovered new evidence that Saturn's moon Enceladus holds material that is important to the early development of life.</p>
<p>The American space agency said the new evidence came from observations made by its Cassini spacecraft. Cassini spent seven years observing seasonal changes around Saturn. During that time, the spacecraft also collected data on Saturn's moons.</p>
<p>Two of Cassini's discoveries involved Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus. In its observations of Titan, the spacecraft studied the moon's climate activity and recorded data on rivers, lakes and oceans. Cassini also found evidence of several Earth-like qualities of Titan that could support life.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Water from the subsurface ocean of Saturn's moon Enceladus sprays from huge fissures out into space.

<p>Another Cassini discovery involved the observation of hydrogen molecules in ice particles and <strong>vapor</strong> shooting upward from the moon's surface. Researchers announced that finding in 2017, the same year Cassini officially ended its <strong>mission</strong>.</p>
<p>In announcing that discovery, NASA scientists said the presence of hydrogen molecules could signal deep-sea chemical reactions between water and rock that could create microbial life.</p>
<p>Now, the space agency is sharing a new finding that supports the earlier discoveries. Scientists examining Cassini data said they identified "strong confirmation" of the presence of another molecule seen as important for enabling life.</p>
<p>Evidence of the molecule – hydrogen cyanide – was found in data relating to the same shooting flows of ice and water vapor observed by Cassini on Enceladus.</p>
<p>The team used data collected by an instrument aboard Cassini designed to measure the activity of gas, ions and ice particles around Saturn. The discovery process involved a lot of mathematics aiming to understand the newly examined data.</p>

<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The new evidence is described <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02160-0.epdf?sharing_token=9f1fFhF9x9DTwwV3Z4KYPtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O62obxNW8k7GDHtvLUshnFEHPyLmkRC9CrS4VWCC4iWzGprsnt-SNu6EBvPgXNhKu_g09avF1rQpc6EgUqbrTYGqv1r68pzsZqFESsPMU6Dvgyq4KlXUNeNP_gtWiJyoM%3D">in a study</a> in <em>Nature Astronomy</em> by scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.</p>
<p>The lead writer of the study, Jonah Peter, is currently a doctoral student at Harvard University. He called the discovery of hydrogen cyanide "particularly exciting," saying the molecule is "the starting point for most theories on the <strong>origin</strong> of life."</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-study-finds-life-sparking-energy-source-and-molecule-at-enceladus">said in a statement</a> that for life to exist in space, there must be collections of the right building blocks. One of the most important of these is amino acids. "Hydrogen cyanide is one of the most important and <strong>versatile</strong> molecules needed to form amino acids," NASA noted.</p>
<p>The researchers said hydrogen cyanide molecules can join together in many different combinations. They can also serve as a "<strong>precursor</strong>" for different kinds of amino acids.</p>
<p>In addition, the latest examination of Cassini data suggested the underground ocean on Enceladus "holds a powerful source of chemical energy." The ocean sits beneath the moon's icy surface.</p>
<p>"Unidentified until now, the energy source is in the form of several organic compounds, some of which, on Earth, serve as fuel for organisms," NASA said.</p>
<p>Astronomers involved in the research said that the discovery provides fresh evidence that there may be more chemical energy inside Enceladus than previously thought. The more energy that is available, the team said, the more likely it is that life can form and survive.</p>
<p>"Not only does Enceladus seem to meet the basic requirements for <strong>habitability</strong>," said JPL's Jonah Peter, "we now have an idea about how complex biomolecules could form there, and what sort of chemical pathways might be involved."</p>
<p>The search for possible life on Titan will continue when NASA launches its Dragonfly exploratory mission in 2026. Dragonfly is a drone, or pilotless aircraft. The vehicle is designed to capture images and also land on Titan to collect data.</p>
<p>Tom Nordheim is a planetary scientist at JPL who helped lead the research. He noted that although NASA purposely sent the spacecraft crashing into Saturn's atmosphere to end its service, Cassini is still proving to be a valuable research tool.</p>
<p>"Our study demonstrates that while Cassini's mission has ended, its observations continue to provide us with new <strong>insights</strong> about Saturn and its moons..." Nordheim said.</p>

            <title>Study Suggests Obesity Increasing Among US Children  (2023/12/25) | 研究表明美国儿童肥胖率增长</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 24 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.51voa.cn/202312/study-suggests-obesity-increasing-among-us-children.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>A new study adds to evidence that obesity is becoming more common in young children in America.<br/>
一项新的研究进一步证明，肥胖在美国幼儿中变得越来越普遍。</p>
<p>The study appeared in the medical publication Pediatrics.<br/>
这项研究发表在医学期刊《儿科学》上。</p>
<p>The findings are similar to other national data, which suggests around 2.5 percent of all preschool-aged children were severely obese during the same period.<br/>
这一发现与其他国家数据相似，这些数据表明，在同一时期，约2.5%的学龄前儿童严重肥胖。</p>
<p>One of the study's writers, Heidi Blanck of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said "We were doing well and now we see this upward trend....We are dismayed at seeing these findings."<br/>
该研究的作者之一，美国疾病控制和预防中心的海蒂·布兰克说：“我们做得很好，现在我们看到了这种上升趋势……我们对这些发现感到沮丧。”</p>
<p>Dismayed is a term that means very worried or disappointed.<br/>
Dismayed是一个术语，意思是非常担心或失望。</p>
<p>The study looked at children ages 2 to 4 who took part in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. The program gives healthy foods and other services to preschool-aged children in low-income families. The children were weighed and measured.<br/>
这项研究观察了2至4岁参加妇女、婴儿和儿童（WIC）项目的儿童。该计划为低收入家庭的学龄前儿童提供健康食品和其他服务。孩子们测量了体重和身高。</p>
<p>The researchers found that 2.1 percent of kids in the program were severely obese in 2010. Six years later, the rate had dropped to 1.8 percent. But by 2020, it was 2 percent. That amounts to about 33,000 of more than 1.6 million kids in the WIC program.<br/>
研究人员发现，2010年，该项目中有2.1%的儿童严重肥胖。六年后，这一比例降至1.8%。但到2020年，这一比例为2%。这相当于参与WIC项目的160多万儿童中的约3.3万人。</p>
<p>The study showed major increases in 20 states. California's was the highest at 2.8 percent. There also were large increases in some racial and ethnic groups. The highest rate, about 2.8 percent, was among Hispanic children.<br/>
这项研究显示，有20个州的严重肥胖比例大幅增加。加利福尼亚州的比例最高，为2.8%。一些种族和族裔群体的严重肥胖比例也大幅增加。西班牙裔儿童的比例最高，约为2.8%。</p>
<p>Experts say severe obesity at a very early age is nearly irreversible – meaning the damage is nearly impossible to undo.<br/>
专家表示，年幼时期的严重肥胖几乎是不可逆转的，这意味着这种损害几乎不可能消除。</p>
<p>Severe obesity is strongly linked with health problems and an early death.<br/>
严重肥胖与健康问题和过早死亡密切相关。</p>
<p>It is not clear why the increase occurred, Blanck said.<br/>
布兰克说，目前还不清楚为什么会出现这种增长。</p>
<p>When WIC obesity rates dropped, some experts suggested 2009 policy changes might be responsible. Those changes took out juice from infant food packages, provided less saturated fat, and tried to make it easier for people to buy fruits and vegetables.<br/>
当WIC肥胖率下降时，一些专家认为原因可能是2009年的政策改革。这些改革消除了婴儿食品包中的果汁，减少了饱和脂肪，并试图让人们更容易购买水果和蔬菜。</p>
<p>The package has not changed. But "the daily hardships that families living in poverty are facing may be harder today than they were 10 years ago, and the slight increases in the WIC package just weren't enough," said Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a Duke University childhood obesity researcher.<br/>
这些食品包没有改变。但是，杜克大学儿童肥胖研究人员萨拉·阿姆斯特朗博士说：“如今生活在贫困中的家庭每天面临的困苦可能比10年前更严重，而WIC项目食品包的小幅增加还不够。”</p>
<p>The researchers faced difficulties. The number of kids in WIC declined in the past ten years. And the study included 2020, the year the COVID-19 pandemic hit. At the time, fewer parents brought their children in to see doctors. That reduced the amount of complete information available.<br/>
研究人员面临困难。在过去的十年里，WIC项目的孩子数量有所下降。这项研究包括新冠肺炎大流行的2020年。当时，带孩子来看病的父母越来越少。这减少了可用的完整信息量。</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, it was a "very well done study," said Deanna Hoelscher, a childhood obesity researcher at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health. She added, "It gives you a hint of what's going on."<br/>
休斯顿公共卫生学院健康科学中心的儿童肥胖研究员迪安娜·霍尔舍说，尽管有局限性，但这是一项“做得很好的研究”。她补充道，“这提示了现状。”</p>
<p>What has happened since 2020 is not yet known. Some small studies have suggested an increase in childhood obesity — especially during the pandemic. During the pandemic, kids were kept home from schools. Their eating and bedtime schedules were changed and physical activity decreased.<br/>
自2020年以来发生了什么还不得而知。一些小型研究表明，儿童肥胖率有所上升，尤其是在疫情期间。疫情期间孩子们被关在家里不上学。他们的饮食和就寝时间发生了改变，体育锻炼也有所减少。</p>
<p>"We are thinking it's going to get worse," Hoelscher said.<br/>
“我们认为情况会变得更糟，”霍尔舍说。</p>

<p>Mental health expert Oleh Hukovskyi recently stood in a temporary classroom in eastern Ukraine speaking to a group of soldiers. They were attending a class on how to deal with the <strong>stress </strong>of war.</p>
<p>Hukovskyi is one of hundreds of professionals and volunteers across Ukraine treating soldiers for mental health problems. It is a growing issue for an army facing <strong>fatigue</strong> as soldiers fight a larger enemy.</p>
<p>Reuters news agency spoke to 13 people involved in supporting troops and four soldiers undergoing treatment. The treatment can last for a few days to several weeks in more serious cases. It also includes soldiers who have lost arms or legs and who are learning to live with their injuries.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Serhii Rostikov, (R) head of a unit for combat stress control of the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, speaks with a soldier, Nov. 17, 2023.

(REUTERS/Sofiia Gatilova)</span></div>
<p>Soldiers spoke of stress, <strong>anxiety</strong>, fear, guilt and being extremely tired. But they also spoke of friendship, a sense of <strong>obligation</strong> to hurry back to their units and a strong desire to repel the enemy.</p>
<p>Hukovskyi is one of the soldiers Reuters spoke to. He is a former <strong>psychiatrist</strong>. He joined the armed forces about six months after Russia launched an invasion in February 2022.</p>
<p>Now, he runs a mental health support group attached to the 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade. The brigade is in the area of Lyman, a town heavily damaged by the war.</p>
<p>"They have obligations and have to return to the front line," Hukovskyi said of the troops.</p>
<p>Some of the soldiers are being treated for light wounds and battle stress at a medical aid center.</p>
<p>Hukovskyi said Ukrainian soldiers were not given enough breaks from fighting.</p>
<p>"Forty-five days is a <strong>critical</strong> period when soldiers can stay and...have a chance to stay mentally healthy," he said. He added that in some situations they might remain in battle longer. When that happens, they experience more head injuries and more battle fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen soldiers</strong></p>
<p>Many of those fighting joined as volunteers. They had little, if any, preparation for sometimes fierce combat conditions.</p>
<p>The soldiers attending the class answer questions and suggestions. However, Hukovskyi knows there are limitations. Soon, the soldiers will have to return to fighting.</p>
<p>"Ukraine has an army of <strong>mobilized</strong> citizens who just yesterday were teachers, artists, poets, IT specialists, or workers," said Dana Vynohradova. He is deputy brigade commander for mental health support.</p>
<p><strong>Nightmares and fear</strong></p>
<p>"DJ" attended Hukovskyi's class last month. Before the war, he was a factory worker from central Ukraine. Like most other soldiers, he goes by his <strong>call sign</strong>, DJ.</p>
<p>"I have <strong>nightmares</strong> and they <strong>exhaust</strong> me. When I get some time to rest, I don't sleep at all," DJ told the group. Later, the 50-year-old explained that he was not prepared for the fierce combat.</p>
<p>DJ said his position near the front line was under continuous attack by Russian forces. Like others, he said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a <strong>concussion</strong>.</p>
<p>On a rainy November day in a nearby village, Dmytro, a 24-year-old soldier, talks with his unit's stress control group leader. He is a man named Serhii Rostikov. The Russians occupied the village in 2022. The two men walk and talk among damaged houses.</p>
<p>Rostikov said soldiers decide for themselves whether to seek mental health support. However, other specialists said unit commanders could make recommendations if they see signs for concern.</p>
<p>"After the artillery shelling, I developed a fear of going back to (combat) positions," said Dmytro. He is with the 21<sup>st</sup> Separate Mechanized Brigade.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that he reached out to his former group leader Rostikov for help. After working together, Rostikov sent Dmytro to <strong>rehabilitation</strong>. Dmytro said, "...I have no fear now and can easily go back to a combat position. I think we need <strong>psychologists</strong>, because soldiers suffer from a lot of stress."</p>
<p>Many soldiers who seek psychological support return to battle after short breaks. Some more serious cases are sent away from the front for more treatment.</p>
<p>DJ later said he had been kept away from combat for further treatment. Dmytro has rejoined his unit.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian military has tried to recruit more people for psychological support.</p>
<p>Ukraine's armed forces declined to answer questions about efforts to get support workers. It also did not release how many soldiers had been treated for psychological conditions since the start of the invasion. Such details are often treated as military secrets.</p>

In 1822, an American professor named Clement Clarke Moore wrote a poem that redefined the image of Saint Nicholas. It was called "Account of a Visit from Saint Nicholas." He did not expect it to be published. He wrote it as a Christmas present for his young children. In recent years, experts have questioned whether Moore actually wrote the poem.</p>
<p>Some believe it was written by Henry Livingston, a map maker in New York who wrote and published funny poems in his spare time.</p>
<p>But whoever wrote this classic poem, it has since become a favorite around the world. This poem combines the traditions of Santa Claus, seasonal decorations and gift-giving that have come to define Christmas in America.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9BC4B48F-8C2D-4097-B73E-B411786E115D_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'</span></div>
<p>We give you the staff of Learning English reading Clement Clarke Moore's poem, popularly known as "'Twas the Night Before Christmas."</p>
<p>
<em>‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br/>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br/>
In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.</em></p>
<p><em>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br/>
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.<br/>
And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,<br/>
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.</em></p>
<p><em>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br/>
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br/>
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br/>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</em></p>
<p><em>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Gave lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
When, what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br/>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.</em></p>
<p><em>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.<br/>
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br/>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!</em></p>
<p><em>"Now Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!<br/>
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!<br/>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</em></p>
<p><em>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br/>
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br/>
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br/>
With the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br/>
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br/>
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br/>
Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.</em></p>
<p><em>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br/>
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br/>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br/>
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.</em></p>
<p><em>His eyes -- how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br/>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.</em></p>
<p><em>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br/>
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br/>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br/>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</em></p>
<p><em>He spoke not a word, and went straight to his work,<br/>
Filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br/>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!</em></p>
<p><em>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</em></p>
<p><em>Dorothy Gundy produced the video.</em></p>

<span class="datetime">23 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about the word "season." We use this word in many different ways.</p>
<p>"Season" can <strong>refer to </strong>one of the four parts of the year. For example, Washington, D.C. is in a part of the United States that has four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Some parts of the U.S. do not have four seasons.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A diver dressed as Santa Claus performs amongst fish during a Christmas-themed underwater show at an aquarium in Seoul, South Korea on December 4, 2019.

" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/A98A677E-54CF-4C5F-867A-156CD807A4D4_cx6_cy0_cw91_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A diver dressed as Santa Claus performs amongst fish during a Christmas-themed underwater show at an aquarium in Seoul, South Korea on December 4, 2019.

</span></div>
<p>"Season" can also describe the periods marked by warmth and growth or cold weather and falling leaves. For example, when the weather becomes warmer and days are lighter longer, the growing season begins for some plants. When the weather gets colder and the days darker, the <strong>hibernation</strong> season begins for some animals.</p>
<p>We also use "season" to describe periods that are only related to the weather. For example, some areas of the world have <u>rainy seasons</u> and <u>dry seasons</u>. Some parts of the U.S. have <u>tornado season</u>. And in other parts of the world there are <u>monsoon seasons</u>.</p>
<p>"Season" can also refer to the time before and during a major holiday. December is a busy <u>holiday season</u> in many parts of the world. Holidays include Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Winter Solstice. December is often a time to take a break from work and spend time with loved ones.</p>
<p>Speaking of Christmas, when we say <u>‘tis the season</u> we are talking about something dealing with this holiday – its good side and its not-so-good side. For example, let's say I give a co-worker a big box of homemade cookies. They might say to me, "Thanks! But why are you giving me so many cookies?" I can answer, "'Tis the season!"</p>
<p>Here is another example. If I go out to a store and it is packed with holiday shoppers, I could <strong>complain</strong> to a friend. And they could respond, "Well, ‘tis the season!" What they <em>really </em>mean is this: At this time of the year, stores are usually very busy with Christmas shoppers.</p>
<p>In fact, Christmas is like <u>open season</u> on shopping deals. "Open season on" something means that it is being hunted, targeted, or in this case ... bought.</p>
<p>"Open season" also describes a period of time when a particular activity or opportunity is unrestricted. It is widely available. This term probably comes from hunting. Hunting traditionally has many restrictions. People can hunt only at certain times of the year and even then, there are restrictions on which animals and how many you can hunt. Fishing too has similar restrictions. But if it is open season, there are few restrictions.</p>
<p>As in our earlier shopping example, we can use this term for just about anything that is targeted with few restrictions. When talking about the best times to travel, for example, it is a good idea to travel <u>off-season</u>. If few people are traveling, it is a good time to find <strong>cheap</strong> air travel, hotels, and <strong>rental</strong> cars. It is open season on travel deals.</p>
<p>And like <u>hunting season</u>, we can have other "seasons" too. For example, beach areas are popular during <u>tourist season</u>. And people with <strong>allergies</strong> probably do not like <u>hay fever season</u> or <u>allergy season</u>.</p>
<p>So, "season" can simply mean a time of the year marked by a special activity. Sports seasons, for example, are popular with fans of sports.</p>
<p>We also have different seasons in our lives: Our time as children, going off to college, becoming parents, helping our aging parents, starting new careers or starting retirement. These are all different seasons of life. And they all have different <strong>aspects</strong> to enjoy and to be thankful for.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time ...</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about George Walker Bush. He took office in 2001 as the 43rd president.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - George W. Bush" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/39fec087-a03f-4396-8a32-cdca08f06a08_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - George W. Bush</span></div>
<p>He has a similar name to another president -- his father, George Herbert Walker Bush.</p>
<p>To simplify things, Americans sometimes call the younger Bush "43," or simply "W." Here we will just call him Bush.</p>
<p>Because Bush is a recent president, historians have not reached a broad agreement on his time as a leader.</p>
<p>But he will surely be remembered for facing one of the biggest challenges to any president: the attacks against the U.S. on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>George Bush was born in the northeast state of Connecticut. But his parents soon moved to the southwest state of Texas. George grew up there and considered Texas home.</p>
<p>The Bush family had a long background in politics. Bush's grandfather was a senator. His father held many public offices. In some ways, George was prepared for a career in politics, too.</p>
<p>He went to the same private <strong>boarding school</strong> as his father. Then, like his father and grandfather, George went to Yale for college. He also worked on several political campaigns. But he said he did not consider pursuing politics.</p>
<p>Instead, he earned a degree in business at Harvard and took a job in an oil company in Texas. In time, he founded his own oil business.</p>
<p>And he married <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/laura-welch-bush/">Laura Welch</a>, who was a teacher and librarian in their hometown. They had <strong>twin </strong>daughters named Barbara and Jenna.</p>
<p>In these years as a young adult, Bush began to make some changes. He began attending a Christian church regularly. He decided to stop drinking alcohol because it was creating problems in his personal life. And he turned his attention to politics.</p>
<p>Bush lost the first election in which he competed, a race to become a member of Congress. So, for a while, he focused on business investments and helping his father's political career.</p>
<p>But in 1992, his father lost re-election to the presidency. And the younger Bush saw a chance to enter politics himself again. In 1994, Bush ran for governor of Texas. To many people's surprise, he won.</p>
<p>Four years later, he was overwhelmingly re-elected. Many voters liked his image as, what he called, a "<strong>compassionate</strong> conservative." In other words, he wanted to use traditional Republican ideas about government to help society.</p>
<p>Following two successful terms as governor, Bush turned his attention to the presidency. In 2000, he competed against the vice president at the time, Al Gore. The winner was not announced until more than a month following the election – usually, the winner is announced within hours.</p>
<p>Both sides disputed the process of counting votes in the state of Florida. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the process. The Court ordered state officials to stop re-counting votes. Bush's lead stood.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Bush entered office expecting to bring many of the ideas he pursued in Texas to the entire nation. For example, as president he permitted religious groups to receive government funding, and set national standards for public schools.</p>
<p>These moves were popular with many voters. But they also challenged some American traditions: the separation of church and state, and the ability of public schools to govern themselves.</p>
<p>For many presidents, these policies might have created a <strong>legacy</strong>. But early in Bush's term, he faced a crisis that defined much of his time in office.</p>
<p>Hijackers linked to the al-Qaeda group seized four airplanes on September 11, 2001. They purposely crashed two planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, eventually killing more than 2,700 people.</p>
<p>Another plane was flown into the Pentagon, the country's military headquarters outside of Washington, DC. About 200 people died there.</p>
<p>The fourth plane was aimed at another important target. But passengers fought the hijackers. The plane lost control and crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. All 44 people on board died there.</p>
<p>President Bush was visiting an elementary school in Florida that morning. He learned about the attacks while he was reading with the children.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Bush spoke to the nation. He said the U.S. would answer both the terrorist groups and the countries that permitted terrorist groups to <strong>thrive</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the next years, Bush took a number of actions to create a new national security strategy. They included creating a Department of Homeland Security, making changes to the country's intelligence operations, and reforming the U.S. military.</p>
<p>He also sent U.S. forces into Afghanistan to destroy terrorist networks there. Bush was especially targeting the person who had designed the September 11 terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>The struggle in Afghanistan was successful at first, but continued throughout Bush's time in office. And bin Laden was not captured while Bush was president.</p>
<p>In 2003, Bush opened another front on what some called the "war on terror." He and other government officials said the leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was developing weapons that could kill many people. They said Hussein – and his connections to terrorist groups – threatened Americans and people in other countries.</p>
<p>Hussein did not agree to leave Iraq. So U.S. and British forces launched bombs at targets in the country's capital. Additional troops destroyed what was left of the targets. Hussein was quickly overthrown.</p>
<p>But the weapons of mass destruction were not found.</p>
<p>For the rest of Bush's presidency, U.S. forces remained in Iraq. Bush promised that Americans would stabilize the country and help Iraqis create a democratic government.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>The presidency of George W. Bush is too recent to understand its impact. But there is some evidence of the public's reaction at the time.</p>
<p>Bush received some of the highest ratings of any president. In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, 90 percent approved of his leadership.</p>
<p>He was re-elected in 2004. But his popularity steadily decreased .</p>
<p>At the end of his second term, he had one of the lowest public approval ratings of any president: 33 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy had entered a recession. More Americans disagreed especially with his decision to invade Iraq. And some criticized his government for responding too slowly after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and the country's Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Since Bush left the White House in 2009, his approval ratings have – like those of many presidents – risen again. He has mostly avoided public appearances. Instead, he has enjoyed playing sports, helping charities, and reading U.S. history.</p>
<p>He also began a new hobby: painting. He has created <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/president-george-bush-portraits-of-courage/3748579.html">portraits</a> of dozens of veterans to honor their service in the military.</p>

            <title>South African Company to Make Rings that Protect Against HIV  (2023/12/23)</title>

<p>A South African company will make <strong>vaginal</strong> devices that protect against HIV. Medical experts say that should at some point make them less costly and more easily available.</p>
<p>HIV is a virus that causes AIDS, a serious disease that affects the body's natural defense system, or immune system.</p>
<p>The Population Council is an international nonprofit that does medical research. It announced recently that the South African healthcare company Kiara Health will start making the devices, or rings, from the medical product silicone in the next few years. It estimates that 1 million could be produced each year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman dances as she listens to music while attending a World AIDS Day commemoration at Nkosi's Haven in Johannesburg on Nov. 30, 2019 on the eve of World AIDS Day.

(AP Photo/Denis Farrell, File)</span></div>
<p>The devices release a drug that helps prevent HIV infections. They are approved by nearly 12 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The nonprofit group owns the rights to the ring, which are now made by a Swedish company. About 500,000 rings are currently available to women in Africa at no cost, bought by donors.</p>
<p>Ben Phillips is a spokesman at the U.N. AIDS agency. He said the ring gives women the freedom to use it without anyone else's knowledge or agreement.</p>
<p>"For women whose partners won't use a condom or <strong>allow</strong> them to take <strong>oral</strong> (preventative HIV) medicines, this gives them another option," he said. A condom is a device worn by a male partner to prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexual diseases.</p>
<p>HIV remains the leading cause of death among women of <strong>reproductive</strong> age in Africa. And 60 percent of new infections are in women, information from WHO shows.</p>
<p>The ring releases the drug dapivirine in small amounts over a month. It currently costs $12 to $16, but experts expect the price to drop once it is widely produced in Africa. Developers are also working on a version that will last up to three months, which should also lower the yearly cost.</p>
<p>WHO has suggested the ring be used as an additional tool for women at high risk of HIV. Officials in more than 12 African countries, including South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe have also approved it.</p>
<p>WHO pointed to two studies in its approval, saying the ring reduced women's chances of getting HIV by about a third. While other research has suggested the risk could be dropped by more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, I'm Caty Weaver.</p>
<p>Today, Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith present a special program on Christmas traditions in the United States during the first half of the 19th century.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Santa Claus drives his reindeer and sleigh float along Central Park West during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023, in New York.

</span></div>
<p>During this period, there was no set way of celebrating the day, which was not yet an official holiday. Communities around the country honored the day in different ways. Some observed Christmas as an important Christian religious day honoring the birth of Jesus. Others celebrated the day with parties, music, drinking and eating. And, some communities did not celebrate the day at all.</p>
<p>But, it was during this period that Americans began to reinvent the holiday. They combined ancient Christmas traditions from different cultures with modern American influences.</p>
<p>Here are Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith.</p>
<p>In 1819, the popular American writer Washington Irving wrote a series of five essays<strong> </strong>published in a book called <em>The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent</em>.</p>
<p>The essays describe a wealthy British landowner who invites his farm workers into his home to celebrate Christmas. The landowner recreates a traditional Christmas as it would have been celebrated in the distant past. Irving praised this looking back to ancient traditions. He liked the idea of different levels of <strong>society</strong> coming together to enjoy a<strong> festive</strong> and peaceful holiday. Washington Irving seemed to express concern about the lack of such <strong>unifying </strong>Christmas traditions in modern America.</p>
<p><strong>Immigrants shape Christmas traditions</strong></p>
<p>Penne Restad wrote a book <em>Christmas in America: A History</em>. It shows how Americans began to slowly shape Christmas into a unifying national holiday during the first half of the 19th century. She describes how Christmas had different meanings for Americans who came from different cultural and religious backgrounds. Many immigrants brought Christmas traditions from their own countries.</p>
<p>Religion played a big role in how an American might celebrate the holiday. Calvinist Christians banned the celebration of Christmas. But groups such as Episcopalians and Moravians honored the day with religious services and seasonal <strong>decorations</strong>.</p>
<p>By mid-century, Christian groups began to ignore their religious differences over the meaning of Christmas and honored the day in special ways.</p>
<p>Christmas became an important time for families to celebrate at home. More and more Christian Americans also began to follow the European traditions of Christmas trees and giving gifts. Christians believed that the tree represented Jesus and was also a sign of new beginnings. German immigrants brought their tradition of putting lights, sweets and toys on the branches of evergreen trees placed in their homes.</p>
<p>This tradition of setting up a Christmas tree soon spread to many American homes. So did the <strong>practice</strong> of giving people presents. As these traditions increased in popularity, the modern trade and business linked to Christmas also grew.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas as a holiday</strong></p>
<p>As Christmas became more popular, some states declared the day a state holiday. Louisiana was the first state to make the move in 1837. By 1860, 14 other states had followed. It was not until 1870 that President Ulysses Grant made Christmas a federal holiday.</p>
<p>Americans already knew old Christmas songs that came from England and other areas of Europe. But many new American Christmas songs started to become popular. For example, in eighteen forty-nine, a religious leader from Massachusetts wrote the words to <em>It Came Upon a Midnight Clear</em>.The song <em>J</em><em>ingle Bells </em>appeared seven years later. And, a year later, a religious leader in Williamsport, Pennsylvania wrote the song <em>We Three Kings of Orient Are</em>.</p>
<p>And of course, no discussion of Christmas would be complete without talking about of one of the holiday's most famous representations, Santa Claus.</p>
<p>This character is based on the story of Saint Nicholas, a Christian holy person believed to have lived in the third century. Saint Nicholas became known as a protector of children. Different cultures have given him different names. These include Sinterklaas, Kris Kringle and Father Christmas. But for most Americans his most popular name would become Santa Claus.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, many Dutch immigrants living in the United States celebrated the feast of Saint Nicholas on December 6. Saint Nicholas was especially important to New Yorkers because of their history as a Dutch colony. In 1809, Washington Irving published his <em>History of New York</em>. It lists Saint Nicholas as the patron saint of New Yorkers. He describes the saint wearing a low hat, large pants, and smoking a pipe. Does this description sound familiar?</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the words "assessment" and "evaluation."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>What is difference between Assessment and evaluation?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Assessment &amp; Evaluation" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f32e-08dc0101902a_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Assessment &amp; Evaluation</span></div>
<p>Noor</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Noor. This is a good question.</p>
<p>Many people use the terms assessment and evaluation interchangeably. That means they see little or no difference between them in most cases. The terms are related. They both involve performance and education, but they are not the same thing. It is a mistake to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Assessment <strong>focuses on</strong> student learning, documenting what students know and what they can do. Assessment has many purposes. They include finding out a student's overall ability, measuring to what <strong>degree</strong> a student has gained control of an identified set of <strong>criteria</strong>, and providing students with information about their strengths and weaknesses. Assessment is a continual process. Its goal is to help students improve.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences using assessment.</p>
<p><em>Teachers should use classroom assessments to inform instruction.</em></p>
<p><em>The students completed a weekly assessment.</em></p>
<p><em>The school uses a variety of assessment tools.</em></p>
<p>Evaluation often focuses on the performance of an organization. Evaluation involves using criteria and evidence to find out if an organization is meeting its goals. Evaluation only happens at set times, and its goal is to judge the quality of an organization. Assessment can be a part of the evaluation process. That is because assessment results are often used to make judgements.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences using evaluation.</p>
<p><em>The class was canceled due to results from the curriculum evaluation.</em></p>
<p><em>The school district completed its special education program evaluation last month.</em></p>
<p><em>The governor focused on the lack of school counseling evaluations.</em></p>
<p>Although assessment and evaluation are both used in education and relate to measuring performance, they have different focuses, purposes, timing, and <strong>outcomes</strong>. The terms are also used a lot in other fields such as finance, medicine and engineering.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this explanation has helped you, Noor.</p>

<p>A large Swedish study has found an unexpected finding about people diagnosed with extreme fear of serious illness. It found they are more likely to die earlier than people who are not as concerned about their health.</p>
<p>Hypochondriasis, now called illness anxiety disorder, is a rare condition with <strong>symptoms</strong> that go beyond average health concerns. People with the disorder are unable to lose their fears despite normal doctor visits and lab tests. Some may change doctors repeatedly. Others may avoid medical care.</p>
<p>Dr. Jonathan E. Alpert of Montefiore Medical Center in New York said, "Many of us are mild hypochondriacs." But he added there are also people on the extreme side of it who are always worrying and thinking about whether they have a serious illness.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A hospital exam room is seen in Alabama on Thursday, July 30, 2015.

<p>People with the disorder are suffering and "it's important to take it seriously and to treat it," said Alpert, who was not involved in the new study. Treatment can include behavioral <strong>therapy</strong>, calming methods, education, and sometimes mental health medication.</p>
<p>The researchers have found that people with the condition have an increased risk of death from both natural and unnatural causes, including suicide. Continuing<strong> stress</strong> and its effects on the body could explain some of the differences, the writers said. The study was published recently in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>.</p>
<p>David Mataix-Cols of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden led the research. "We got lucky," he said, because the Swedish system for organizing disease has a separate entry for hypochondriasis. That permitted research on thousands of people over 24 years, from 1997 to 2020.</p>
<p>Older research had suggested the risk of suicide might be lower for people with the condition. Mataix-Cols said their research found that statement was incorrect. In the study, the risk of suicide death was four times higher for people with the condition.</p>
<p>They looked at 4,100 people with hypochondriasis and <strong>matched</strong> them with 41,000 people similar in age, sex, and where they lived. They used a measurement called person years, which measures the number of people and how long they were followed.</p>
<p>Overall death rates were higher in the people with hypochondriasis, 8.5 instead of 5.5 per 1,000 person years. People with the condition died younger than the others, with a <strong>mean</strong> age of 70 instead of 75. The risk of death from diseases related to body systems, such as breathing and eating, was higher. The risk of death from cancer, however, was about the same.</p>
<p>Alpert leads the American Psychiatric Association's group on research. He said more care is needed when suggesting a patient to mental health professionals. Patients can become angry because they feel they are being accused of imagining symptoms.</p>
<p>Alpert added, "... <strong>fortunately</strong>, there are good treatments."</p>

<p>Thailand is looking for investment to build a "land bridge" across the narrow southern part of the country. The Southeast Asian nation hopes to provide a shorter path for <strong>cargo</strong> between the Pacific and Indian oceans without having to go through the Malacca Strait and Singapore.</p>
<p>Under the plan, cargo would travel by highway and railroad from the area of Chumpon on the Gulf of Thailand to Ranong on the Indian Ocean to be loaded onto waiting ships.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been seeking support for the $28-billion project from investors around the world. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in San Francisco, Srettha said the land bridge would connect the oceans "without requiring ships to sail down along the tip of Singapore, known to experience <strong>congestion</strong> and would cut transport <strong>duration</strong>." He called it a "very important project, not just for Thailand, but also for the world."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Thailand is looking for investment to build a land bridge across its southern neck, which would cut cargo transit times. " src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-63c8-08dc0140a04d_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Thailand is looking for investment to build a "land bridge" across its southern neck, which would cut cargo transit times. </span></div>
<p>Thailand says it is open to interest from all investors. After a meeting with Japanese businesses and leaders, Srettha said there was interest in the project without providing additional information. Thai transport minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said more than 10 American companies expressed interest without naming them.</p>
<p><strong>China's interest in the area</strong></p>
<p>China, an important trade nation in the area, has not commented on the plan for the land bridge.</p>
<p>For many years, Chinese businesses have been pushing for a deepwater project called the Kra Canal. The canal would cross the Kra Isthmus and would permit large ships to pass. The proposed project would cut at least one day of sailing time from passing through the Malacca Strait.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha set up a Chinese-supported center to study the canal idea. But it has never started because of the cost and possible environmental damage.</p>
<p>Sompong Putivisutisak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University, has studied the land bridge proposal. Sompong said, "(China) won't give away its position that easily until it sees the other investors."</p>
<p>He told VOA there are two reasons that China would invest in the land bridge project: "First, financial <strong>benefits</strong>, secondly geopolitics. Financially, this project is not worth the investment, but geopolitically it could be interesting as China would have control over both seas."</p>
<p>At a Belt and Road Initiative meeting in Beijing last October, Thai officials said the land bridge could be connected to another high-speed railway under construction from Thailand to Singapore. Srettha even drew a map of the route during a meeting, which he posted online.</p>
<p>But critics say the plan is unlikely to win China's full backing. They say a land bridge would require loading and unloading cargo from ships and would not save any time.</p>
<p>Somboon Kamhang, chairman of the Coordinating Committee on Development, called it "another dreamy project." He told VOA, "China isn't interested in the land bridge project. Building a land bridge is just way too costly and <strong>time-consuming</strong>, but China can get behind the canal idea which could give it more control over the region."</p>

<p>The European Union has reached an agreement that sets new rules for controlling migration.</p>
<p>The deal, announced Wednesday, will become part of an EU agreement called the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. <em>The Associated Press </em>reported the document will need to get final EU approval by February and is expected to enter into force by June.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the agreement is to set new rules to ease difficulties facing EU nations as they seek to deal with migrant arrivals. The deal also aims to establish a process for EU nations to more fairly share the duties and costs related to migration.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Federal Police attempt to find a group of migrants who illegally crossed the border from Poland into Germany, while on patrol in a forest near Forst south east of Berlin, Germany, on Oct. 11, 2023.

<p>The laws cover <strong>screening</strong> policies for when migrants first arrive in the EU. They also provide rules relating to migrants seeking asylum and set guidelines for processing <strong>applications</strong> and dealing with possible migration crises.</p>
<p>"It's truly a historic day," European Parliament President Roberta Metsola told reporters in Brussels after the negotiations. She added that reaching an agreement was important because migration is likely to be a major campaign issue ahead of EU elections in June.</p>
<p>"Let's not underestimate the risk if we had not reached such a deal," Metsola said. She added that she hopes the agreement will persuade EU members not to establish individual borders because the migration flows can now be more effectively dealt with.</p>
<p>Migrant arrivals in the EU are down from a high in 2015 of more than 1 million. Most of those migrants entering Europe were fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. But the flows started to increase in recent years and reached 255,000 so far this year through November, Reuters news agency reported. More than half of these crossed the Mediterranean from Africa, mainly to Italy.</p>
<p>Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi called the deal a "great success" for Europe and Italy. He said it should help EU border countries most involved with migration feel less alone.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said finding agreement on migration disputes was very important and can help lighten the load for the most affected EU states, including Germany.</p>
<p>Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he sees the deal improving "control over migration" and providing a better asylum process for migrants to the EU. Far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders aims to replace Rutte after winning the country's elections last month on a campaign that included anti-migration policies.</p>
<p>Under the new system, countries not at the EU border will have to choose between accepting their share of 30,000 asylum applicants or paying nearly 22,000 euros per person to the EU.</p>
<p>The screening system seeks to separate those in need of international protection from others who are not.</p>
<p>People whose asylum applications have a low chance of approval – such as those from India, Tunisia or Turkey – can be prevented from entering the EU and detained at the border. People seen as representing a threat to security can also be held at the border. The agreement also sets policies for speeding up the processing of applications.</p>
<p>While praised by many European leaders, the agreement also received criticism from groups seeking to assist migrants.</p>
<p>The European Council on Refugees and Exiles – a migrant rights organization – condemned the proposed rules on X, formerly Twitter. The group said the policies were "Byzantine in their complexity and Orban-esque in their cruelty." The message was commenting on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who ordered the building of security fences to keep migrants out of the country.</p>
<p>Rights group Amnesty International said it sees the deal setting EU asylum law back many years and leading to greater suffering for people seeking asylum. It also said the agreement is likely to cause more people "to be put into <strong>de facto</strong> detention" at the EU's borders, including families with children and other "<strong>vulnerable</strong>" individuals.</p>

<p>Many Americans will travel over the winter holidays, often to return to the homes and towns of their childhood. For people from the state of West Virginia, and wider <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/discover-americas-appalachian-trial/2766408.html">Appalachia</a>, one song comes to mind on the trip home: <em>Take Me Home, Country Roads</em>.<em> </em>Singer John Denver co-wrote and performed the 1971 song. It became a major hit.</p>
<p>Recently, my favorite singer, Lana Del Rey, recorded her version of the song after performing in West Virginia in October.</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will look at parts of the song performed by Del Rey and connect it to grammar and <strong>figurative</strong> language.<strong> </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Grammar and Figurative Language in " country="" home="" me="" roads="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d776-08dc01aef575_w268_r1.png" take=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Grammar and Figurative Language in "Take Me Home, Country Roads" </span></div>
<p>Let's look at the first <strong>verse</strong> of the song.</p>
<p><strong>Metaphors, appositives, and comparative adjectives</strong></p>
<p><em>Almost Heaven, West Virginia</em></p>
<p><em>Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River</em></p>
<p><em>Life is old there, older than the trees</em></p>
<p><em>Younger than the mountains, growing like a <strong>breeze</strong></em></p>
<p>In the first verse we have a couple of comparisons. One comparison uses an appositive as <strong>metaphor</strong>. The others use comparative adjectives and even a <strong>simile</strong>.</p>
<p>Appositives are nouns or noun phrases that go beside another noun to describe it. Sometimes we can use the appositive structure to create a metaphor.</p>
<p>"Almost Heaven, West Virginia" is a metaphor using an appositive. Here, our subject is "West Virginia" and the appositive is "Almost Heaven." The appositive is giving more information about "West Virginia." The comma takes the place of the typical verb used to make metaphors, "be."</p>
<p><em>West Virginia is almost Heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Almost Heaven, West Virginia</em></p>
<p>"Heaven" is a perfect place. Many cultures and traditions uphold it as a beautiful, holy place people go when they die.</p>
<p>So, if West Virginia is "almost heaven," its natural landscape of mountains and rivers and trees must be a holy place of beauty.</p>
<p>Next, we have a comparison of "life" in West Virginia. It is "older than the trees" and "younger than the mountains." "Older" and "younger" are comparative adjectives.</p>
<p>Comparative adjectives compare one thing to another. They help express whether something has more or less of a <strong>particular </strong>quality.</p>
<p>The song suggests the ancient history of the land. Scientists say the mountains began to develop about a billion years ago. Life began sometime after that but before the growth of trees, the song goes.</p>
<p>And the mountains and life continue into the future, the song then suggests. The writers used the simile, "growing like a breeze," to express this idea.</p>
<p>A simile is a figure of speech in which unlike things are compared with the use of the words "like" or "as."</p>
<p>Breezes come and go and sometimes grow into a stronger wind. This verse could mean that life and land grow with ease in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Let's move onto the <strong>chorus</strong> of the song.</p>
<p><strong>Imperatives and personification </strong></p>
<p><em>Country roads, take me home</em></p>
<p><em>To the place I belong</em></p>
<p><em>West Virginia, mountain mama</em></p>
<p><em>Take me home, country roads</em></p>
<p>In the chorus of the song, we have an interesting grammatical feature and some figurative language.</p>
<p>We have an imperative structure that is repeated in the beginning and end of the chorus:</p>
<p><em>Country roads, take me home</em></p>
<p><em>Take me home, country roads</em></p>
<p>Imperatives are predicate-only clauses used to give instruction, direction or command. Imperative sentences use the base form of the verb and may have other information.</p>
<p>We know that this song was written about a road trip through the mountains and rural communities. The singer seeks direction from the "country roads," themselves, to find the way home.</p>
<p>We also have more figurative language. The writers refer to West Virginia as "mountain mama." This is an example of personification or the human representation of a non-living thing.</p>
<p>The reference humanizes West Virginia and suggests that it is the mother of mountains. But, it uses the more childlike term, "mama" for mother. The word expresses hominess, warmth and <strong>nostalgia</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Today we looked at the beloved song <em>Country Roads</em>. We found figurative language like metaphors using appositives and personification, which is the humanizing of non-living things.</p>
<p>We even found some interesting grammar with the use of comparative adjectives like "younger" and "older" to describe life in West Virginia and imperatives or commands to give direction through the "country roads."</p>
<p>I'm Faith Pirlo.</p>
<p>And I'm Anna Mateo. And we're both from West Virginia.</p>

<p>The U.S. space agency says an orange cat named Taters is the star of the first video sent by laser from deep space.<br/>
美国航天局表示，第一段由激光从外太空发送的视频的主角是一只名叫“土豆”的橘猫。</p>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft sent the 15-second video to Earth from 30 million kilometers in space. The video shows Taters as he chases a red laser light.<br/>
美国宇航局的普赛克飞船从3000万公里外的太空向地球发送了这段15秒的视频。视频显示“土豆”在追逐红色激光灯。</p>
<p>It took less than two minutes for the video to reach Caltech's Palomar Observatory. The video quality is called ultra high-definition. It was sent at the test system's maximum rate of 267 megabits per second.<br/>
这段视频传输到加州理工学院的帕洛玛天文台花了不到两分钟时间。这种视频质量被称为超高清。它是以该测试系统每秒267兆的最大速率发送的。</p>
<p>NASA loaded the video into Psyche's laser communication experiment before launching the spacecraft to visit a rare metal asteroid in October. The mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, decided to use an employee's three-year-old cat.<br/>
美国宇航局在10月发射普赛克飞船前往一颗稀有金属小行星，在此之前，它将视频加载到了飞船的激光通信实验中。位于加利福尼亚州帕萨迪纳的美国宇航局喷气推进实验室的任务团队决定使用一名员工的三岁猫。</p>
<p>The video was sent to Earth on December 11 and was released by NASA this week. The test sent the video faster than most internet connections here on Earth, said project leader Ryan Rogalin.<br/>
该视频于12月11日发送到地球，并于本周由美国宇航局发布。项目负责人瑞恩·罗加林说，这次实验发送视频的速度比地球上大多数互联网连接的速度都快。</p>
<p>NASA wants to improve communications from deep space as it prepares efforts to send astronauts to the moon and possibly to the planet Mars. The laser test is meant to send data at rates up to 100 times greater than the radio systems currently used by spacecraft far from Earth.<br/>
美国宇航局希望改善深空通信，为将宇航员送上月球和火星做准备。这次激光实验旨在以比目前远离地球的航天器使用的无线电系统高出100倍的速率发送数据。</p>
<p>More tests are planned as Psyche heads towards the main area of asteroids between the planets Mars and Jupiter. But Taters will not be making anymore appearances, JPL said.<br/>
喷气推进实验室表示，随着普赛克飞船前往火星和木星之间小行星的主要区域，计划进行更多实验。但是“土豆”不会再出现了。</p>
<p>Joby Harris is an art director in JPL's DesignLab. He could not be any happier, but he does not want his cat's new public attention to go to his head.<br/>
乔比·哈里斯是喷气推进实验室设计实验室的艺术总监。他再高兴不过了，但他不想让他的猫再次受到公众关注。</p>
<p>"I'm celebrating his spotlight with him but making sure he keeps his paws on the carpet," Harris said in an email Tuesday.<br/>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) became a popular subject in 2023. Still, the technology has a long way to go to meet people's futuristic expectations of human-like machines.</p>
<p>ChatGPT was central to this year's attention on AI. The <strong>chatbot </strong>showed the world recent developments in computer science, although not everyone understood quite how it works or what to do with it.</p>
<p>AI scientist Fei-Fei Li suggested that 2023 would be remembered for the great changes in technology as well as the public awakening. It was a year for people to figure out "what this is, how to use it, what's the <strong>impact </strong>— all the good, the bad and the ugly," she added.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone with an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT's Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston.

<p><strong>Concerns over AI</strong></p>
<p>The first AI concerns of 2023 began soon after New Year's Day. That is when classrooms reopened and schools from Seattle to Paris started blocking ChatGPT. Students were already asking the chatbot — released in late 2022 — to write papers and answer take-home tests.</p>
<p>AI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by predicting the next word in a sentence. The models make such predictions after having "learned" the structure of a huge number of human-written works. The large language models often get facts wrong. But the results appeared so natural that it created interest in the next AI developments and possible uses for trickery and <strong>deception</strong>.</p>
<p>Worries grew as this new group of generative AI tools produced not just words but also images, music and voices. They seemed to threaten the jobs of anyone who writes, draws, and creates music and computer languages. Concerns about AI tools fueled strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal disputes from artists to writers.</p>
<p>Some of the most respected AI scientists warned that the technology's progress was marching toward outsmarting humans and possibly threatening their existence. Yet other scientists called the warnings overblown and brought attention to more immediate risks.</p>
<p>By spring, AI-created videos known as deepfakes had appeared in U.S. election campaigns. Deepfakes are videos that contain realistic images but with digital changes to people's actions and speech. One deepfake falsely showed Donald Trump <strong>embracing</strong> the nation's former top infectious disease expert. The technology made it increasingly difficult to tell the difference between real and fake videos of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the AI crisis affected ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI. The San Francisco-based company led by chief executive Sam Altman was nearly destroyed by disagreements over its mission.</p>
<p>AI debates also led to new laws from the European Union and consideration from others, including the United States Congress.</p>
<p><strong>Too much excitement?</strong></p>
<p>AI products released in 2023 have brought technology achievements not possible in earlier times. But the market research company Gartner says they arrive with "inflated expectations" and "massive claims" about its abilities.</p>
<p>Gartner analyst Dave Micko said leading AI developers are pushing the latest technology with their current line of products, including search engines and workplace productivity software.</p>
<p>He said, "As much as Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Apple would love us to adopt the way that they think about their technology and that they deliver that technology, I think adoption actually comes from the bottom up."</p>
<p>It is easy to forget that this is not the first appearance of AI in business. The technology has been used to help guide self-driving cars, compare objects and individual faces, and recognize speech in software like Siri and Alexa.</p>
<p>In 2011, Tom Gruber launched Siri, which was bought and used by Apple in the iPhone. At that time, it was the only major use of AI that people had ever experienced.</p>
<p>But Gruber believes what's happening now is the "biggest wave ever" in AI, launching new possibilities as well as dangers.</p>
<p>The dangers could come fast in 2024. Major national elections in the U.S., India and elsewhere could get flooded with AI-created deepfakes.</p>
<p>In the longer term, AI technology's rapidly improving language, visual sensing and step-by-step planning abilities could create a kind of digital assistant — but only if given access to the "inner loop of our digital life stream," Gruber said.</p>
<p>"They can <strong>manage </strong>your attention as in, ‘You should watch this video. You should read this book. You should <strong>respond</strong> to this person's communication,'" Gruber said. He added, "That is what a real executive assistant does. And we could have that, but with a really big risk of personal information and privacy."</p>

            <title>UN: Myanmar Overtakes Afghanistan as World’s Top Opium Producer  (2023/12/21)</title>

<span class="datetime">20 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>A United Nations report finds that Myanmar has <strong>overtaken</strong> Afghanistan as the world's top opium producer.</p>
<p>The change came after Myanmar expanded its opium production for a third year, the U.N. reported. In Afghanistan, production fell sharply in 2023 after the Taliban placed a ban on poppy farming.</p>
<p>The latest data on worldwide opium production was recently released in the U.N.'s report, the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2023/Southeast_Asia_Opium_Survey_2023.pdf">Southeast Asia Opium Survey 2023</a>. The report was released by the U.N.'s Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man walks through a flowering opium poppy field in Shan state, Myanmar, 2023.

(UNODC)</span></div>
<p>The report estimates opium crops in Afghanistan dropped an estimated 95 percent in 2023 after the Taliban's ban and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>During the same period, an increasing number of farmers in Myanmar turned to opium as a new crop. The increase in production follows a military takeover of the government in 2021 that pushed the country into a civil war. The situation has severely hurt Myanmar's economy.</p>
<p>The U.N. report estimates poppy growth and processing in Myanmar grew 33 percent in 2022 and another 18 percent this year. That amounts to a total of 47,000 hectares. That is the most land Myanmar has used for opium production since 2013.</p>
<p>Jeremy Douglas is the area representative for the UNODC. He told VOA the country's economic and security situation have severely limited business possibilities and led more people to turn to opium farming to make money.</p>
<p>Most families in Myanmar make their living off the land. But a World Bank report released in May found that nearly half of farming families said they worry about having enough food. That number was up from 26 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The UNODC estimates Myanmar's farmers grew enough poppy this year to produce up to 1,080 metric tons of dry opium. This amounted to total earnings of up to $2.5 billion. Most of this money is believed to have gone to traffickers shipping the product across Asia and as far as Australia, often as heroin.</p>
<p>Most of that heroin flows through neighboring Thailand on its way to other places. In September, Thai police seized over 440 packs of heroin, along with some 15 million methamphetamine pills. A top Thai law enforcement official told VOA the $8.2 million drug seizure was the largest in the country's history.</p>
<p>The UNODC report notes Afghanistan's reduced opium production is expected to create a worldwide heroin shortage and drive prices higher. This is likely to lead even more farmers in Myanmar to start growing poppies.</p>
<p>Douglas said such a shortage could also result in more heroin processed in the Golden Triangle area making its way beyond the Asia-Pacific to Europe and North America. The Golden Triangle is a heavily criminalized area near the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. It is known for growing and producing large amounts of drugs.</p>
<p>Afghan heroin started taking over the European and North American markets from the Golden Triangle more than 10 years ago. That change came as drug controllers in Southeast Asia started dealing mostly in methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Douglas told VOA that even as Afghan production falls sharply, there is still large demand for opium on the world market. He said, "It's highly likely that we're going to start seeing Golden Triangle heroin returning to markets that it hasn't been in for quite some years."</p>

<p>Public schools in the United States are increasingly employing online mental health services, or teletherapy, for students.</p>
<p>At least 16 of the 20 largest American public school systems are offering online therapy to reach millions of students, reports the Associated Press. In those systems alone, schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $70 million.</p>
<p>The business model is making so much money that <strong>venture capitalists </strong>are investing in new companies as the market grows. However, some experts have raised concerns about the quality of care offered by fast-growing tech companies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An employee of Hazel Health displays the opening page of the company's app, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023 (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-fa9b-08dbfb5fa7e5_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An employee of Hazel Health displays the opening page of the company's app, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023 (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)</span></div>
<p>But educators say teletherapy works for many kids and is meeting a large need. Schools are also experiencing shortages in on-site therapists. Online help has made therapy more easily available to children, especially poorer students and those in rural areas. Schools let students connect with online <strong>counselors</strong> during the school day or after hours from home.</p>
<p>Ishoo is a mother of two in Lancaster, California. She struggled to help her second-grade daughter deal with severe <strong>anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>Last spring, her school district started a teletherapy program and Ishoo signed up her daughter. During a month of weekly video sessions at her home, the girl opened up to a therapist. The therapist gave the student tools and techniques to reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>"She learned that it's OK to ask for help, and sometimes everyone needs some extra help," Ishoo said.</p>
<p>The 13,000-student school system, like many others, has counselors and psychologists on staff. But it is not enough to meet the need, said Trish Wilson, the Lancaster <strong>supervisor</strong> of counseling.</p>
<p>Therapists in the area have full caseloads, making it impossible to offer students immediate care, she said. Students rarely have to wait long for an online session.</p>
<p>Students and their parents said in interviews they turned to teletherapy after struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness, stress and anxiety. For many, returning to in-person school after distance learning was very difficult.</p>
<p>Schools are using federal pandemic relief money to pay for help as experts have warned of worrying rates of youth depression, anxiety and suicide. Many school districts are signing contracts with private companies. Others are working with local health care providers, nonprofits or state programs.</p>
<p>Mental health experts welcome the extra support but warn about possible risks. For one, it is getting harder to employ on-site school counselors and psychologists. Competition with telehealth providers is not helping.</p>
<p>"We have 44 counselor <strong>vacancies</strong>, and telehealth definitely <strong>impacts</strong> our ability to fill them," said Doreen Hogans. She is supervisor of school counseling in Prince George's County, Maryland. Hogans estimates 20 percent of school counselors who left have taken teletherapy jobs. The jobs often provide more favorable working hours than the schools.</p>
<p>The quick growth of the companies raises questions about the quality of the therapists, and their experience with children and privacy, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel. He is executive director of Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools improve traditional, in-person mental health services.</p>
<p>One of the biggest providers is San Francisco-based Hazel Health. It started with telemedicine health services in schools in 2016 and expanded to mental health in May 2021, CEO Josh Golomb said. It now employs more than 300 therapists providing teletherapy in over 150 school districts in 15 states.</p>
<p>Other providers are getting into the space. In November, New York City started a free telehealth therapy service for teens to help end barriers to <strong>access</strong>, said Ashwin Vasan, the city's health commissioner. New York is paying the company TalkSpace $26 million over three years for a service permitting teenagers to download an app and connect with therapists.</p>
<p>Unlike other cities, New York is offering the service to all teens, whether attending private, public or home schools, or not in school at all.</p>
<p>"I truly hope this normalizes and democratizes access to mental health care for our young people," Vasan said.</p>

            <title>Pope Approves Blessings for Same-sex Couples  (2023/12/20)</title>

<p>Pope Francis officially approved letting Catholic clergy <strong>bless</strong> same-sex <strong>couples</strong>, the Vatican announced Monday.</p>
<p>The move is a complete change in church policy that aims to make the church more welcoming while continuing its ban on <strong>gay</strong> marriage.</p>
<p>Some have cheered the Vatican statement as a step to break down discrimination in the Catholic Church. But LGBTQ+ supporters say the policy means that the church still considers gay couples as less than heterosexual partners.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pope Francis leads the Angelus prayer from his window, at the Vatican, Dec. 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-fce2-08dbffdc46d7_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Pope Francis leads the Angelus prayer from his window, at the Vatican, Dec. 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>The Vatican document expands on a letter that Francis sent to two conservative cardinals last October. In that letter, Francis suggested such blessings could be offered if they were not seen or mistaken as marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>The new document repeats that condition and reaffirms that marriage is a lifelong union between a man and a woman. It stresses that the blessings must not be tied to any Catholic celebration or religious service and should not be performed at the same time as a marriage ceremony. Also, the blessings cannot use ceremonial acts, clothing or movements that belong in a wedding.</p>
<p>But it says requests for such blessings for same-sex couples should not be denied. "For, those seeking a blessing should not be required to have <strong>prior</strong> moral perfection," it said.</p>
<p>The document added, "There is no <strong>intention</strong> to <strong>legitimize</strong> anything, but rather to open one's life to God, to ask for his help to live better..."</p>
<p>The Vatican holds that marriage is a union between man and woman. As a result, it has long opposed same-sex marriage and considers homosexual acts to be "disordered." Nothing in the new document changes that teaching.</p>
<p>In the new document, the church says a blessing is about helping people increase their trust in God. "It is a seed of the Holy Spirit that must be nurtured, not hindered," it said.</p>
<p>It stresses that people in "irregular" unions of extramarital sex — gay or straight — are in a state of sin. But that should not keep them from God's love or <strong>mercy</strong>. "Even when a person's relationship with God is clouded by sin, he can always ask for a blessing, stretching out his hand to God," the document said.</p>
<p>The document is the latest attempt by the Pope to welcome gay Catholics. In 2013, he said, "Who am I to judge?" when asked about a gay clergy. Earlier this year, he told The Associated Press that "being homosexual is not a crime."</p>
<p><strong>Reactions to the announcement</strong></p>
<p>Ramón Gómez oversees human rights for the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation in Chile. He said the statement was a step toward breaking down discrimination in the church and could help LGBTQ+ people in countries where even civil unions are not legal. But he said the document "gives the signal that same-sex couples are <strong>inferior</strong> to heterosexual couples."</p>
<p>The Reverand James Martin supports welcoming LGBTQ+ Catholics. He praised the new document as a "huge step forward" and a change from the Vatican's 2021 policy.</p>
<p>"Along with many Catholic priests, I will now be delighted to bless my friends in same-sex marriages," he said in an email.</p>
<p>In Germany, clergy have been blessing same-sex couples for years. And the head of the German Bishops Conference welcomed the document.</p>
<p>Bishop Georg Baetzing said, "This means that a blessing can be given to couples who do not have the opportunity to marry in church, for example due to divorce, and to same-sex couples."</p>
<p>In the United States, the Reverand John Oesterle, a Catholic priest in Pittsburgh, said many priests would probably not be open to offering such a blessing, but he welcomed Francis' action.</p>
<p>He said, "When I was growing up, the <strong>assumption</strong> was that God made everyone straight. What we have learned is that is not true. In accepting people as God made them, and if Jesus' primary teaching is we should love and serve one another in the community, I think that's what gives Pope Francis the openness to God's presence in those relationships."</p>
<p>Traditionalists, however, expressed shock and anger. Luigi Casalini of Messa in Latino (Latin Mass) blog wrote that the document did not follow the church's teachings. "The church is crumbling," he wrote.</p>
<p>University of Notre Dame theologian Ulrich Lehner was also concerned. Lehner called it: "The most unfortunate public announcement in decades." He said it could lead to division in the church.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The recent attacks on ships in and near the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels have affected some of the world's top shipping and oil companies. The threat has moved trade away from an important route for global trade. The change will likely cause delays and increase the prices of goods and energy.<br/>
也门胡塞叛军最近在红海及其附近袭击船只，影响了一些世界顶级航运和石油公司。该威胁使贸易偏离了全球贸易的一条重要航道。这一变化可能会造成延误，并提高商品和能源的价格。</p>
<p>Both oil and European natural gas prices rose a little over market concerns about Houthi attacks. The group, which is supported by Iran, confirmed two new attacks Monday. They were the latest in a series of attacks targeting container ships and oil tankers passing through the narrow waterway that separates Yemen from East Africa. The waterway then leads north to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. It is estimated that 10 percent of the world's trade passes through the canal.<br/>
由于市场对胡塞袭击事件的担忧，石油和欧洲天然气价格都略有上涨。由伊朗支持的该组织星期一证实了两起新的袭击事件。这是针对通过也门与东非之间狭窄水道的集装箱船和油轮的一系列袭击中的最新一起。然后，这条水道向北通向红海和苏伊士运河。据估计，世界贸易的10%通过该航道。</p>
<p>Energy supplies reach Europe and beyond on tankers. And food products like palm oil and grain are carried by container ships through the Suez Canal.<br/>
能源供应通过油轮到达欧洲及其他地区。棕榈油和谷物等食品由集装箱船通过苏伊士运河运输。</p>
<p>"This is a problem for Europe. It's a problem for Asia," said John Stawpert. He is with the International Chamber of Shipping. The industry group represents 80 percent of the world's commercial shipping fleet. Stawpert noted that 40 percent of Asia-Europe trade normally takes the route through the Red Sea.<br/>
“这是欧洲的麻烦，也是亚洲的麻烦，”约翰·斯塔珀特表示。他在国际航运协会工作。该行业机构代表了全球80%的商业航运船队。斯塔珀特指出，40%的亚欧贸易通常通过红海航道。</p>
<p>Almost all goods that stores need for Christmas will have already arrived. But online orders could be delayed, experts said. That is because four of the world's five largest container shipping companies have suspended or rerouted movements from the Red Sea in recent days.<br/>
商店圣诞节所需的几乎所有商品都已到货。但专家表示，网上订单可能会延迟。这是因为最近几天，世界五大集装箱运输公司中的四家已经暂停或改变了从红海的运输路线。</p>
<p>MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM Group, and Hapag-Lloyd are shipping companies that move all consumer goods between Asia and Europe. Almost "all services will have to make this rerouting," said Simon Heaney, who is with Drewry, a shipping research group.<br/>
地中海航运公司、马士基、达飞集团和赫伯罗特是在亚洲和欧洲之间运输所有消费品的航运公司。航运研究组织德鲁里航运咨询公司的西蒙·希尼说，几乎“所有公司都必须重新安排路线”。</p>
<p>Ships will have to go around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead. That will add at least a week of travel time, experts say.<br/>
船只将不得不绕行南非的好望角。专家表示，这将增加至少一周的航行时间。</p>
<p>Depending on what companies decide to do, they could add more ships to make up for the longer trip. They could also travel faster, but that would use more fuel.<br/>
根据公司的决定，他们可以增加更多的船只来弥补更长的行程。它们也可以行驶得更快，但这会消耗更多的燃料。</p>
<p>Stawpert of the Shipping Chamber said he expects some price increases in the short term. But that depends on how long the security threat lasts.<br/>
航运商会的斯塔珀特表示，他预计短期内价格会有所上涨。但这取决于该安全威胁持续的时间。</p>
<p>The Houthi military spokesman said Monday his group launched what he described as "naval aircraft" at the Cayman Islands-flagged ship Swan Atlantic. The boat is a chemical and oil products carrier. The group also attacked the Panama-flagged cargo ship MSC CLARA. He did not offer more details.<br/>
胡塞军方发言人周一表示，胡塞武装向悬挂开曼群岛国旗的“大西洋天鹅”号发射了他所说的“海上无人机”。这艘船是一艘化学品和石油产品运输船。该团伙还袭击了悬挂巴拿马国旗的“地中海航运克拉拉号”货轮。他没有提供更多细节。</p>
<p>Denmark-based ship operator Uni-Tankers said the Swan Atlantic was hit by an unknown object that started a small fire. Crew members put it out and all were reported to be safe, the company said. It received military aid and continued on its way.<br/>
总部位于丹麦的船舶运营商Uni Tankers表示，大西洋天鹅号被一个不明物体击中，引发了一场小火灾。该公司表示，船员将火扑灭，所有人员都安然无恙。它得到了军事援助并继续前进。</p>
<p>U.S., French, British and other warships already patrol the area, keeping the waterway open. Stawpert said countries' naval presence has increased and that should improve confidence in the shipping industry and somewhat ease the threat.<br/>
美国、法国、英国等国军舰已经在该地区巡逻，保持航道畅通。斯塔珀特说，各国海军的存在已经加大，这应该会提高对航运业的信心，并在一定程度上缓解威胁。</p>
<p>Problems in Red Sea shipping could have far-reaching effects because they are happening at the same time ships are being restricted through the Panama Canal. The canal is a major trade route between Asia and the United States.<br/>
红海航运问题可能会产生深远影响，因为这些问题发生的同时，船只正被限制通过巴拿马运河。这条运河是亚洲和美国之间的一条主要贸易路线。</p>
<p>Some companies had planned to reroute to the Red Sea to avoid delays at the Panama Canal caused by a lack of rainfall, experts said.<br/>
专家表示，一些公司曾计划改道前往红海，以避免巴拿马运河因降雨量不足而导致的延误。</p>
<p>With the Houthi attacks, companies taking measures to avoid risk will have to take the longer route around Africa.<br/>
随着胡塞袭击事件的发生，各公司采取措施规避风险将不得不绕非洲走更长的路线。</p>

<p>Health officials said the study was the first nationally representative estimate of how many U.S. adults have chronic fatigue syndrome. The study gathered information from 2021 to 2022. It found that 1.3 percent of American adults reported having CFS or something like it.</p>
<p>These numbers from the CDC are larger than earlier studies have suggested. They likely include people with long COVID, a condition of long-lasting sickness after a COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>The findings led CDC's Dr. Elizabeth Unger to say that CFS "is not a rare illness." She was one of the writers of the report.</p>
<p>The tiredness and other symptoms of CFS can get worse after exercise, work, or other activity. There is no cure, and no testing leads to a quick <strong>diagnosis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>No known cause</strong></p>
<p>Doctors do not know the cause. However, research suggests it is the body's overreaction to an infection or other shock to the immune system.</p>
<p>The condition gained attention nearly 40 years ago, when many cases were reported in Incline Village, Nevada, and Lyndonville, New York. Some doctors dismissed it, calling it psychosomatic. Psychosomatic means a problem is mental or emotional rather than physical.</p>
<p>Some doctors also called it "yuppie flu." "Yuppie" stands for "young, urban professional," people who have good jobs and medical coverage.</p>
<p>Some doctors still think CFS is a mental condition, experts and patients say.</p>
<p>Doctors "called me a <strong>hypochondriac</strong> and said it was just <strong>anxiety</strong> and depression," said Hannah Powell. She is a 26-year-old woman from Utah who was diagnosed after five years.</p>
<p><strong>New findings from the report</strong></p>
<p>The new CDC report is based on a <strong>survey</strong> of more than 57,000 U.S. adults. They were asked if a doctor or other health-care professional had ever told them they had myalgic encephalomyelitis, or CFS, and whether they still have it. About 1.3 percent said yes to both questions.</p>
<p>CDC officials said that results in an estimate of 3.3 million U.S. adults.</p>
<p>The study also reported other findings. It said that CFS was more common in women than men. White people reported the condition more than other racial and ethnic groups. Earlier, smaller studies reported similar findings.</p>
<p>The findings showed there was less of a difference between women and men than some earlier studies suggested. And there was little difference between Black and white people.</p>
<p>However, the study also found that a higher percentage of poor people reported the condition than wealthy people.</p>
<p><strong>CFS is not a popular diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Brayden Yellman is a specialist at the Bateman Horne Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He said patients who report the condition usually have health care coverage. He said doctors might believe them more when they say they "continue to be <strong>fatigued </strong>and can't go to work."</p>
<p>The CDC study is based on patients' memories. It did not use medical records. That could lead to overcounting. However, it is possible that only a percentage of people with CFS are diagnosed, said Dr. Daniel Clauw. He is director of the University of Michigan's Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center.</p>
<p>He added that is not a "popular diagnosis to give because there (are) no drugs approved for it. There (are) no treatment guidelines for it."</p>
<p>The total number likely includes some patients with long COVID who were suffering from long-term tiredness, CDC officials said.</p>
<p>"We think it's the same illness," Yellman said. But long COVID is more widely accepted by doctors and is being diagnosed much more quickly, he said.</p>
<p>Powell, one of Yellman's patients, was a high school athlete who came down with an illness during a trip to Belize before her final year. Doctors thought she had malaria, and she seemed to recover. But she developed chronic tiredness, had trouble sleeping, and had frequent <strong>vomiting</strong>. She said she slowly stopped playing sports and had trouble doing schoolwork.</p>
<p>After five years, a doctor said she had chronic fatigue. She began to regain normal life through regular treatments of fluids and medications. She graduated from the University of Utah and now works for an organization that helps domestic violence victims.</p>
<p>Getting care is still a struggle, she said.</p>
<p>"When I go to the (emergency room) or to another doctor's visit, instead of saying I have chronic fatigue syndrome, I usually say I have long COVID," Powell said. "And I am believed almost immediately."</p>

            <title>The Story of Santa Claus  (2023/12/19)</title>

<span class="datetime">18 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Santa Claus is someone who will remain in the hearts of children forever. He is the make-believe person who brings toys and other gifts to children at Christmas. To grown-ups, he is a special symbol of good will and selfless giving.<br/>
<br/>
Santa Claus also has some other names, like Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle and Pelznickel.</p>
<p>The Santa Claus we talk about in the United States flies from his home at the North Pole on Christmas Eve to bring toys and gifts to children. The happy, white-bearded man is dressed in red. He usually flies on a <strong>sleigh</strong> led by his reindeer. Santa enters each home through the <strong>chimney</strong> and fills children's stockings with toys and gifts.</p>
<p>This modern image of Santa Claus largely comes from Clement Clark Moore's famous poem, <em>A Visit from St. Nicholas.</em></p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man dressed as Santa Claus waves during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 23, 2023. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/85ad8313-4d64-40d1-a70d-404bc29466ed_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">A man dressed as Santa Claus waves during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 23, 2023. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)</span></div>
<p><em>‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br/>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br/>
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;...</em></p>
<p><em>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br/>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br/>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;</em></p>
<p>Santa Claus is believed to have come from the story of St. Nicholas. He was a 4th-century clergy in the Mediterranean port city of Myra, part of modern-day Turkey. It is said that St. Nicholas gave away all his wealth to help the poor and the sick. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.history.com/topics/christmas/santa-claus#santa-claus-around-the-world">History.com</a><em> </em>says St. Nicholas became known as the protector of children and sailors. It adds that he was the most popular saint in Europe.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, Dutch immigrants brought the story of Saint Nikolaas and the tradition of gift-giving to New York City. The Dutch said his name very quickly. It sounded like "Sinterklaas." When English speakers said this word, it sounded like Santa Claus.</p>
<p>German immigrants working as farmers in the American state of Pennsylvania also knew of Saint Nikolaas. But they called him Pelznickel. This word came from "pelz," meaning fur in German, and "nickel" for Nicholas. Saint Nikolaasor became a man dressed in fur who came once a year with gifts for good children.</p>
<p>Pelznickel became part of a celebration honoring the Christkindl, as the Germans called the child of Christ. After some time, Christkindl became "Kris Kringle." That is another name you will hear for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>A Santa-liked <strong>figure</strong> is known as Father Christmas in Britain and Père Noel in France. In Scandinavia, an elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. In Italy, a woman called La Befana rides a broomstick down the chimneys of homes to bring toys for lucky children.</p>
<p>The image of Santa Claus as we now see him came from Thomas Nast. He was an American painter born in Bavaria, Germany.</p>
<p>Nast remembered that, when he was a little boy, a kind old man would give toys and cakes to the children on Christmas. So, when Nast painted Santa Claus, he looked like the old man from his childhood.</p>
<p>Nast painted Santa as a short, fat, <strong>jolly</strong> old man with a long beard. He wore a red suit with white fur. He also gave Santa a North Pole workshop, elves, and a wife, Mrs. Claus. Through the years, Nast's painting has remained the most popular picture of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>American children write letters to Santa hoping to be on his "nice list" for Christmas gifts. On Christmas Eve, they leave cookies and milk for Santa and carrots for his reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen and "the most famous reindeer of all," Rudolph.</p>

<span class="datetime">18 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>In Ukraine, a man who goes by his military name Karabas is training to fight against the Russian army. But Karabas is not from Ukraine. He is from Russia.</p>
<p>Karabas was living in Moscow when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He was shocked and very upset, and he decided to act.</p>
<p>He decided to find a way to get to Ukraine. There, he hoped to join troops fighting Russian forces.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Members of the pro-Ukrainian Russian ethnic Siberian Battalion practice at a military training close to Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-49b1-08dbfd928291_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Members of the pro-Ukrainian Russian ethnic Siberian Battalion practice at a military training close to Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)</span></div>
<p>It took him almost a year to make it happen.</p>
<p>Today, he is part of the Siberian Battalion, a group of Russians who have joined the Ukrainian military to fight against their own country. Its members come mostly from ethnic minorities from Russia's far east.</p>
<p>They hope to someday help remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power.</p>
<p>Karabas told The Associated Press that he was <strong>disappointed</strong> in the Russian people. He said he was upset that people were supporting Putin without thinking. And he was upset that they did not seem to care about the war.</p>
<p>"That is why I wanted to come here...and fight for a free Ukraine," he added.</p>
<p>Unlike other volunteer units in Ukraine with Russian nationals, the Siberian Battalion is officially part of the Ukrainian army. To enter the unit, fighters must pass strict security checks. This process can take up to a year.</p>
<p>Karabas went to Armenia first. There, he met Ukrainians and learned to speak the Ukrainian language. Now, he refuses to speak Russian.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian army is training the Siberian Battalion and sending them to the front lines in eastern Ukraine. That area has seen some of the deadliest fighting of the war. Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to fight for control of it.</p>
<p>Fighters in the battalion from eastern Siberia hope a Ukrainian victory will weaken or change Russia's control over their <strong>region</strong>. The area is among the poorest in Russia. People from the area's Yakut and Buryat ethnic communities complain of racism and unfair use of power against them in Russia. This has made some activists call for independence.</p>
<p>Another Russian fighter, who goes by the name Holod, openly said he wants Putin's administration removed from power.</p>
<p>"When this happens, we can talk about victory," he said.</p>
<p>Karabas and other Russians left their entire lives behind, including families and friends.</p>
<p>Some from the battalion have already been sent near Avdiivka, a Ukraine-controlled city in the Donetsk region. The Russian military has been fighting to take control of the area.</p>
<p>The battalion was created six months ago. It has fewer than 100 members, but Ukrainian military leaders hope more will join. Based on <strong>applications</strong> they have received, they are aiming to have up to 300 members in the unit.</p>
<p>Karabas said there may be tens or hundreds of thousands of other Russians like him, willing to fight with Ukraine.</p>
<p>"I think we should have a lot more (Russian fighters)," he said.</p>

<p>American researchers have combined lab-grown human brain tissue with computer hardware to create a working biocomputer.</p>
<p>The scientists say brain cells used in the experiment were able to recognize speech and complete simple math problems.</p>
<p>The team made brain-like tissue that took the form of what they called a "brain organoid." Harvard University's Stem Cell Institute <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/organoids">explains</a> that an organoid is a collection of individualized, complex cells that can be grown from stem cells in a lab.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this July 29, 2013 photo, a researcher holds a human brain in a laboratory at Northwestern University's cognitive neurology and Alzheimer's disease center in Chicago.

<p>Under the right laboratory conditions, organoids can be made to look and even work similarly to real human tissue and organs. In this process, stem cells "can follow their own genetic <strong>instructions</strong> to self-organize," the Stem Cell Institute says.</p>
<p>So far, scientists have been able to produce organoids that look like, or resemble, some organs. These organs include the brain, kidney, lung, stomach and liver. Such lab-created organoids are generally used to study how organs work without needing to experiment on actual organs.</p>
<p>In the biocomputer experiment, the team said stem cells were able to form neurons similar to those found in the human brain. Neurons are electrically charged cells that transport signals to the brain and other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Feng Guo led the experiment. He is a bioengineer and professor of Intelligent System Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. His team recently published their research results <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01069-w.epdf?sharing_token=NYPf_32wRs_t6U-N_UVaLtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M8M4oYFZwXw3ADmbAHb74edPY2vKOF1O-GEmUziwBdM4S_Qm6LsNScxuBszwcCh3Rk4pthEc9aDrLpsaqe7-4YKhK3HWl1E_kodyNXdLfYE8tDAEEOwYPeyB57nYaTS37RGi7ufFW6oTEw56CoODMlO5EDr-JQRXB5mXPmLNcJ7z0bta70aD4yJ4RBCmGphCY%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.technologyreview.com">in a study</a> in <em>Nature Electronics</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers attached the brain organoid to a set of traditional electronic computing <strong>circuits</strong>. The researchers call this system Brainoware. The system was used to establish communication between the organoid and electronic circuits. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool was used to help read the neural activity of the organoid.</p>
<p>The scientists aim to build "a bridge between AI and organoids," Guo <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03975-7">explained</a> to <em>Nature</em>. Guo believes that combining organoids and computer circuits could provide additional speed and energy to improve the performance of AI computing systems.</p>
<p>The study notes that adding human brain power might be able to help machines with the things they do not do as well as people. For example, the researchers said humans generally have a faster learning ability and use less energy thinking than computers do.</p>
<p>During one part of the experiment, the team tested the Brainoware system's voice recognition ability. The team trained the system on 240 recordings of eight different voices. The researchers said the organoid produced different neural signals in reaction to the different voices. The <strong>accuracy</strong> level of the system reached 78 percent, Guo said.</p>
<p>"This is the first demonstration of using brain organoids [for computing]," Guo <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/11/1084926/human-brain-cells-chip-organoid-speech-recognition/">told</a> <em>MIT Technology Review</em>. He added, "It's exciting to see the possibilities of organoids for biocomputing in the future."</p>
<p>Guo said these results persuaded his team that a brain-computer system can work to improve computing performance, especially for some AI jobs. But he noted the best accuracy rates recorded by the Brainoware system were still below the accuracy rates of traditional AI networks. Guo said this is one of the things his team plans to try to improve.</p>
<p>Lena Smirnova is a developmental neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She told <em>Nature</em> that more research will be needed to improve such systems. But she said, "The study confirms some key <strong>theoretical</strong> ideas that could eventually make a biological computer possible."</p>
<p>Smirnova noted that in earlier experiments, researchers have used other kinds of neuron cells to perform similar computational activities. But the latest study, she said, was the first to demonstrate this kind of performance in a brain organoid.</p>

<span class="datetime">17 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>United Nations delegates from nearly 200 countries recently held a climate meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The delegates agreed that the world must move away from fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.</p>
<p>The U.N. meeting on climate change is called COP28 this year. Recently, <em>The Associated Press</em> gave details about some of the main results of notable climate talks over almost 30 years:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Activists demonstrate for climate justice and a ceasefire at the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Dec. 9, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/55a437db-880e-45ed-8ff6-4b4ba8c5a31e_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Activists demonstrate for climate justice and a ceasefire at the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Dec. 9, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>The Kyoto Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was the third high-level U.N. climate meeting. It took place in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.</p>
<p>The agreement asked 41 countries that produced a lot of carbon gases to cut their <strong>emissions</strong> by about five percent compared to their emission levels in 1990.</p>
<p>Countries agreed to some of the terms in the Kyoto Protocol by 2005. The United States and China, however, did not approve the agreement. Those countries have the world's two largest economies and produce the largest amount of carbon gases.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was not successful by some measures. Emissions have greatly increased since then. But it is the first time so many U.N. members agreed that carbon gases were a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Copenhagen's money for the climate</strong></p>
<p>The 2009 climate meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark is widely seen as a failure. Developing and developed countries disagreed on cutting emissions and whether poor nations could use oil, natural gas, and coal to grow their economies.</p>
<p>However, wealthy countries promised to send $100 billion a year to developing countries. The money was to be used for green technology by 2020. Green technology often describes energy technology that does not produce pollution when it is used.</p>
<p>But wealthy nations did not reach their goal of $100 billion by the start of the 2020s. That led to criticism from developing countries and environmentalists.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group, said wealthy countries probably reached their $100-billion goal.</p>
<p>But the British nonprofit group Oxfam said 70 percent of the money was in the form of loans. It said the loans increased debt problems in developing countries.</p>
<p>Also, an increasing number of weather-related disasters are blamed on climate change. Experts say the money promised is not enough. British economist Nicholas Stern said that developing countries likely need $2 trillion every year by 2030 for climate projects and recovery.</p>
<p><strong>The Paris agreement</strong></p>
<p>The Paris Agreement is widely considered the single biggest U.N. agreement on climate change. In 2015, about 196 nations agreed to keep atmospheric warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius since, what the agreement calls, "pre-industrial times." Later, the goal became limiting warming no higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>The U.N. says the Paris agreement is a "legally binding international treaty," meaning that it has the force of law in countries that approve it. But there do not appear to be punishments for countries that do not follow its rules.</p>
<p>Today, the goal of limiting the rise of the atmosphere's temperature to 1.5 degrees is still central to climate discussions. U.N. experts say the world's temperature has not passed the limit set in the Paris agreement. The U.N. says it has warmed from 1.1 to 1.2 degrees Celsius since the early 1800s. But it says the atmosphere will reach the 1.5-degree limit soon unless large cuts in emissions are made quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Glasgow and coal</strong></p>
<p>Six years after the Paris agreement, climate officials wanted another agreement to strengthen the levels agreed upon in 2015.</p>
<p>The meeting in Glasgow, Scotland was put off until 2021. It was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting included protests led by teenaged climate activist Greta Thunberg. She helped lead a worldwide movement of youth activists demanding more action from leaders.</p>
<p>In Glasgow, countries agreed to "<strong>phase</strong>-down" coal use. That is different from saying "phase-out." India and China, two of the world's biggest coal users, pressed for the change.</p>
<p>So far, most countries have failed to meet the promises they made at the Glasgow deal. Emissions from coal have increased and most major coal-using countries have yet to slow use of the fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Loss and damage in Sharm el-Sheikh</strong></p>
<p>Last year, climate talks took place in the Egyptian vacation town of Sharm el-Sheikh. There, countries agreed to create a <strong>fund</strong> for poor nations for the first time.</p>
<p>Delegates agreed to a loss and damage fund. Its aim was to provide money to countries that suffered damage from severe weather events.</p>
<p>Delegates at the COP27 meeting called for the fund to be created after a flood in Pakistan killed an estimated 2,000 people and caused billions of dollars in losses.</p>
<p>The fund was officially created on the first day of this year's talks in Dubai. Over $700 million has been promised. Giving to the fund is voluntary.</p>
<p>U.N. climate experts say billions of dollars are needed because of weather-related events like cyclones, rising sea levels, floods and droughts. The experts blame the extreme events on increasing temperatures in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>An early version of Mickey Mouse, the famous Disney character, will soon belong to you, me and everybody else.<br/>
迪士尼著名角色米老鼠的早期版本很快就会属于大众。</p>
<p>The mouse that started a Hollywood empire, along with several other characters, movies, and books will enter the public domain on January 1st.<br/>
这只开创了好莱坞帝国的老鼠，以及其他几个角色、电影和书籍将于1月1日进入公有领域。</p>
<p>Public domain is the term to describe creative works that are no longer protected by U.S. copyright law. Once a work enters the public domain, it can legally be shared, performed, reused, or repurposed without permission or cost.<br/>
公有领域是一个专业术语，用于描述不再受美国版权法保护的创意作品。一旦作品进入公有领域，就可以合法地共享、表演、重利用或重新调整用途，而无需获得许可或支付费用。</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, and Minnie Mouse, first appeared publicly in the 1928 film Steamboat Willie. Copyright law at the time provided protection for 75 years. But in 1998, U.S. law extended copyright protection for another 20 years.<br/>
米老鼠和米妮老鼠首次公开出现在1928年的电影《汽船威利》中。当时的版权法提供了75年的保护。但在1998年，美国法律将版权保护期又延长了20年。</p>
<p>Jennifer Jenkins is head of Duke University's Center for the Study of Public Domain. Jenkins says copyright law is sometimes called the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. As the character is about to enter the public domain, she says "This is it. This is Mickey Mouse. This is exciting because it's kind of symbolic."<br/>
詹妮弗·詹金斯是杜克大学公有领域研究中心的负责人。詹金斯说，版权法有时被称为《米老鼠保护法》。随着这个角色即将进入公有领域，她说：“就是这样。这是米老鼠。这很令人兴奋，因为它有点象征意义。”</p>
<p>In a statement, the Disney Company told The Associated Press, "Ever since Mickey Mouse's first appearance in the 1928 short film Steamboat Willie, people have associated the character with Disney's stories, experiences, and authentic products." The company added, "More modern versions of Mickey will remain unaffected by the expiration of the Steamboat Willie copyright..."<br/>
迪士尼公司在一份声明中告诉美联社，“自从米老鼠第一次出现在1928年的短片《汽船威利》中以来，人们已经把这个角色与迪士尼的故事、经历和正牌产品联系在一起。”该公司补充道，“现代版本的米奇将不受《汽船威利》版权到期的影响……”</p>
<p>People will only be able to use the version of the mouse in Steamboat Willie that has become public. However, observers expect the courts to be busy in the coming years judging what is inside and outside Disney's ownership.<br/>
人们将只能使用已经开放版权的《汽船威利》中使用米老鼠版本。然而观察人士预计，未来几年，法院将忙于判断属于和不属于迪士尼所有权的情况。</p>
<p>Disney also holds a trademark on Mickey to represent the company and its brand. That law bars the use of the character as a Disney product identifier for anyone except Disney.<br/>
迪士尼还持有米奇的商标，以代表公司及其品牌。该法律禁止除迪士尼以外的任何人使用该角色作为迪士尼产品的标识符。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Others in the public domain<br/>
公有领域的其他</span></p>
<p>Another famous animal character, Tigger, will also join his friend Winnie the Pooh in the public domain. The bouncing tiger first appeared in the book The House at Pooh Corner by British writer A.A. Milne. It turns 96 in January.<br/>
另一个著名的动物角色跳跳虎，也将加入他的朋友小熊维尼的行列进入公有领域。这只蹦蹦跳跳的老虎首次出现在英国作家A.A.米尔恩的《维尼角的小屋》一书中。今年一月份它就满96岁了。</p>
<p>The silly old bear Pooh, himself, became public property two years ago when Milne's book Winnie the Pooh came of age. The soft-spoken bear, no longer protected by copyright, is seen terrorizing women in this year's horror film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.<br/>
两年前，当米尔恩的书《小熊维尼》到了法定年头时，这只傻里傻气的老熊维尼就成了公共财产。这只说话轻声细语的熊不再受版权保护，在今年的恐怖电影《小熊维尼：血与蜜》中，可以看到它吓唬女性。</p>
<p>Other creative works entering the U.S. public domain are Charlie Chaplin's film Circus, Virginia Woolf's book Orlando, and Eugene O'Neill's play Long Day's Journey into Night.<br/>
其他进入美国公有领域的创意作品包括查理·卓别林的电影《马戏团》、弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫的书《奥兰多》和尤金·奥尼尔的戏剧《漫漫长夜》。</p>

            <title>Young Indonesians Clean up Waterways, Better Solution Needed  (2023/12/18)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">17 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Children in the Indonesian city of Bogor are cleaning up a local lake on their own.</p>
<p>The young people take small boats, called kayaks, out on the water. They direct the kayaks toward floating trash. They remove the trash from the water and place it in their boats. Later, on land, all the trash is examined and dealt with.</p>
<p>About 20 children take part in the effort to fight pollution but it began with one boy. Ten years ago, Giri Marhara decided to start cleaning up the lake. He was just 16 years old at the time and had a <strong>habit</strong> of cleaning up his environment.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Environmental activist members of the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior pick up trash while paddling kayaks at Setu Gede lake in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-1582-08dbfcc51fee_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Environmental activist members of the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior pick up trash while paddling kayaks at Setu Gede lake in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)</span></div>
<p>Young people like Marhara have been at the front of environmental and climate change movements in recent years. Movements like school strikes for climate action, protests at United Nations climate talks, and local clean ups have often been youth-led.</p>
<p>The <strong>small-scale</strong> campaigns in Indonesia have been popular with younger people, gaining support and attention.</p>
<p>"For me, cleaning up is <strong>catharsis</strong>, cleaning up is <strong>refreshing</strong>," said Marhara. He said children playing nearby would often ask if they could help him with lake clean up.</p>
<p>They formed a group last year, called the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior, named after the lake. They boat across the lake, pick up trash, and identify what can be recycled.</p>
<p>Marhara and his friends have collected more than 2,700 kilograms of trash in and around the Situ Gede lake.</p>
<p>The trash problem in Indonesia is widespread. Its Environmental and Forestry Ministry says the country produced more than 35 million tons of waste last year. It estimates that 35 percent of waste in the country is <strong>unmanaged</strong>. Garbage along roadways, waterways and natural environments is a common sight.</p>
<p>Waste is also responsible for around 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, says the World Resources Institute. Much of that comes from food waste. If left to <strong>decompose</strong> in landfills, food waste can release methane. The gas warms the planet and is around 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The trash problem has raised health concerns: Plastic waste, for example, gets broken down into tiny pieces called microplastics, which can enter the human body. Studies suggest it can damage the <strong>endocrine</strong>, nervous and immune systems, and can carry an increased risk of cancers.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to landfill or littering for some waste products: food waste can be <strong>composted</strong>, for example. Some other types of waste, like certain types of plastic, can be reused or recycled. But environmentalists also say the world needs to make less waste in the first place, as much of it ends up in landfills or in the world's oceans.</p>
<p>But as waste continues, youth-led clean ups can still make an impact, even if it is just for small areas or communities.</p>
<p>Marhara believes that lasting change will require ending "behavior that is causing trash to be out there in the environment," he said, saying the country has a "<strong>littering</strong> culture."</p>
<p>"I think that the only way to counter that culture is by developing a <strong>counterculture</strong>," a clean up culture, he said.</p>

<p>The presidents of three well-known American universities recently spoke to members of the U.S. Congress about antisemitism on college <strong>campuses</strong>.</p>
<p>Antisemitism is the word used to describe a hatred of Jewish people.</p>
<p>The House's Committee on Education called Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a five-hour hearing in Washington, D.C.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill testifies before a House Education and The Workforce Committee hearing titled Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 5, 2023. (REUTERS/Ken Cedeno)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/803e2aa7-6c8a-4cf3-93a4-430d15d63ba2_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill testifies before a House Education and The Workforce Committee hearing titled "Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 5, 2023. (REUTERS/Ken Cedeno)</span></div>
<p>The Republican-led committee chose the three leaders because their schools "have been at the center of the rise in antisemitic protests," a committee spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The protests are related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. On October 7, Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack in Israel and killed over 1,200 Jewish people. Since then, the conflict has led to the deaths of more than 18,000 people in the Palestinian territory of Gaza.</p>
<p>Protesters who supported Palestine used the word "intifada," an Arabic word for resistance, and the phrase "from the river to the sea." Some people believe the phrase is a call for the death of all Jews.</p>
<p><strong>"Yes or no?"</strong></p>
<p>Representative Elise Stefanik is a Republican lawmaker from New York state. Stefanik, who went to Harvard, asked each university leader about how their school would react to calls to kill a large number of Jews, something described as <strong>genocide</strong>.</p>
<p>Stefanik asked Magill: "Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or <strong>code of conduct</strong>? Yes or no?"</p>
<p>Magill did not answer "yes" or "no." Instead, she said the university only considers if "speech turns into conduct." By that, she meant the university respects an individual's right to free speech. But if the speech became "directed and severe, <strong>pervasive,</strong>" as the president said, it would then be considered more serious. In response to a question about whether a student would be punished for their speech, Magill said it depended on "<strong>context</strong>."</p>
<p>When faced with the same questions from Stefanik, Gay of Harvard and Kornbluth of MIT also did not say "yes" or "no."</p>
<p>Gay answered that it depended on the context. She added that when "speech crosses into conduct, that violates our policies." And Kornbluth answered that she had not "heard calling for the genocide of Jews on our campus."</p>
<p><strong>Criticism and questions of free speech</strong></p>
<p>The answers brought serious criticism from national and state political leaders, students, and members of the college community.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said Magill's answer was "unacceptable." He said talk of genocide against any group of people "is all in the wrong... She needed to give a one-word answer."</p>
<p>A spokesman for President Joe Biden criticized the three college presidents' answers. In a statement, he said they did not go far enough to condemn antisemitism on campuses. And calls for genocide go against "everything we represent as a country."</p>
<p>All three university presidents later apologized for not speaking out against Jewish genocide. Magill called for a review of Penn's policies which she said have long been guided by the U.S. Constitution. Gay wrote that "calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are <strong>vile</strong>, they have no place at Harvard."</p>
<p>Free speech experts say the college presidents' answers at the hearing did follow the current understanding of the Constitution's right to free speech.</p>
<p>Suzanne Nossell is the leader of the nonprofit PEN America, a free-expression organization. She said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects "even deeply hateful speech."</p>
<p><strong>The outcome</strong></p>
<p>The congressional hearing took place on December 5.</p>
<p>By December 9, Magill resigned under pressure from wealthy donors and <strong>alumni</strong>. The pressure had started earlier this autumn when the university permitted a meeting on campus despite charges that some speakers had shown antisemitic views in other comments.</p>
<p>At MIT, the school's leadership group, called the MIT Corporation, announced its support for Kornbluth, who is Jewish, two days after the hearing. It said in a statement, "She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate ..."</p>
<p>Gay faced pressure from Harvard's donors and alumni to step down. But more than 600 Harvard professors voiced their support for her leadership. They say that the school should not be influenced by political pressure.</p>
<p>Laurence Tribe is a well-known law professor at Harvard. He was critical of Gay's answer at the hearing. But he supported her continued leadership. Tribe said that "it is dangerous for universities to be... <strong>bullied</strong> into <strong>micromanaging</strong> their policies."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Harvard leadership group announced that it would stand behind Gay and she would continue as the university's president.</p>

            <title>When Does a Problem 'Snowball'?  (2023/12/17)</title>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>If you live in a part of the world that is experiencing winter right now, it might be snowing.</p>
<p>But even if you do not live in a snowy <strong>climate</strong>, try to image cold, snowy weather. Imagine having a snowball fight with your friends. A snowball is, of course, a ball of snow. But not all snow makes good snowballs. If the snow is too light and dry, it will not hold together. It is <strong>powdery</strong>. Wetter snow makes for great snowballs. You can pack it into a tight ball, which is great for throwing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Snowballs fly during a snowball fight organized by the DC Snowball Fight Association, on the National Mall in the snow, Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/E81E4789-5EA7-4E37-9AAE-5573AD054F7B_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Snowballs fly during a snowball fight organized by the DC Snowball Fight Association, on the National Mall in the snow, Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)</span></div>
<p>A snowball might hurt a bit, but it would not cause a lot of damage. But imagine that snowball rolling down a hill. As it rolls, it picks up more and more snow. It gets bigger and bigger until it crashes into something and causes damage!</p>
<p>And that gives us "snowball" as a verb.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com defines the verb "snowball" as becoming "larger, greater, more <strong>intense</strong>..." very quickly.</p>
<p>If something like a project, campaign, or business snowballs, its progress rapidly increases and grows. For example, after a photographer posted a picture on Instagram of a m<i><i>onkey</i></i> protecting a human baby, her followers snowballed to over 1 million within a week!</p>
<p>However, when we use this expression the ending results are usually not good. Something that snowballs in a bad way <u>goes downhill</u> quickly. For example, when we do not take care of small problems, they can snowball into bigger ones.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear an example using the verb "snowball."</p>
<p><em>A: I have a friend who lied about knowing sign language on her <strong>r</strong></em><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>sum</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><em>. She thought no one would ask her to actually prove she knew sign language. But her boss asked her to. In fact, he set up a big meeting with the deaf community and assigned her to act as <strong>translator</strong>. She lied about why she could not attend the event. But her boss surprised her with an unplanned meeting. That is when he found out that she did not know how to sign. Her lie on her r</em><em>e</em><em>sum</em><em>e</em><em> quickly snowballed into a workplace drama that got her fired from her job. </em></p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the expression <u>snowball effect</u>.</p>
<p>A <u>snowball effect</u> is a situation where one action or event causes many other similar actions or events. And these actions or events grow and grow bigger and more problematic – just like a snowball rolling down a hill.</p>
<p>A snowball effect is similar to a <u>chain of events</u>. However, with a chain of events, one thing leads to another. But these events do not necessarily intensify or grow bigger.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Hopefully, using resources on VOA Learning English is having a snowball effect on your English studies ... in a good way!</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>
VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about William Jefferson Clinton – better known as Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton took office in 1993, and was re-elected in 1996. In many ways, historians consider his time in office a success. The economy expanded, and the country was largely at peace.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Bill Clinton" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7493e0cb-7da8-4433-85f3-39609c1945f0_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Bill Clinton</span></div>
<p>But Clinton had some notable failures, too. He could not persuade Congress to accept a plan to reform the nation's health care system.</p>
<p>And, in his second term, the House of Representatives took steps to remove him from office. But the Senate decided not to act.</p>
<p>Clinton finished his second term with high approval ratings. Yet he is also remembered for being only the second U.S. president to be <strong>impeached</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Bill Clinton came from a town with a memorable name: Hope. He grew up there, and in another nearby town in the Southern state of Arkansas.</p>
<p>For most of his early life, Bill was raised by his grandmother and his mother, both nurses. His father had died in a car accident before he was born.</p>
<p>People who knew Bill as a young man remember him as very intelligent, charming with people, and talented in music. His mother told him he would be president one day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Clinton pursued activities that would lead to a political career. He attended college at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, where he studied international affairs; led student government groups; and took a position as a <strong>clerk</strong> in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>He went on to study at Oxford University in England on a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.</p>
<p>Then he graduated from law school at Yale University. There, he met another student who would be his wife, Hillary Rodham. The two went on to have one child together, a daughter named Chelsea.</p>
<p>After finishing his studies, Clinton returned to his home state of Arkansas and pursued political office. At 32, he became one of the youngest governors ever in the country.</p>
<p>Two years later, he was voted out of office, and -- as historian Russell Riley notes -- he became the youngest <em>former</em> governor.</p>
<p>And that is how a good deal of Clinton's political career continued: in a pattern of successes and failures.</p>
<p>His successes often came as a result of his <strong>centrist</strong> policies, which appealed to people of different political beliefs. He also was an effective public speaker and, to many, a likable, charismatic person who seemed to care deeply about others.</p>
<p>But, his critics pointed out, Clinton also appeared to make many decisions simply for political advantage. And he sometimes tried to please so many people that he pleased no one.</p>
<p>Following a series of increasingly national roles – as well as a series of setbacks – Clinton campaigned for president in 1992. At first, he did not do well in the campaign. He was young and not well-known. He also suffered from reports that he had relationships with women who were not his wife.</p>
<p>But in time, Clinton began winning primary contests. Reporters called him the "Comeback Kid." He earned a public image as a politician who could survive problems.</p>
<p>In the general election, Clinton competed against the sitting president, Republican George H.W. Bush. The two men also faced an unusually strong third-party candidate named Ross Perot.</p>
<p>On Election Night, Clinton prevailed. Because Americans had split their votes among three major candidates, Clinton earned less than 50% of the popular vote. But he won enough electoral votes to become the next U.S. president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>The people who worked on Bill Clinton's presidential campaign adopted an informal motto. They said, "It's the economy, stupid." In other words, campaign officials believed that most Americans cared primarily about how a president's policies would affect their financial concerns.</p>
<p>So, President Clinton quickly set about making a series of economic changes. They included raising taxes on wealthier Americans and cutting spending to help poorer Americans.</p>
<p>In a few years, the U.S. budget deficit was gone, the federal government had a surplus, and the country's financial situation was strong and healthy – although not everyone approved of the steps Clinton took to get there, or believed he should get all the credit.</p>
<p>Early in his first term, Clinton sought an additional reform he believed would help voters' financial concerns: affordable health insurance for all Americans. Most people in the U.S. either bought private health insurance or did not have any insurance to help pay for medical costs. Clinton wanted to find a way for the U.S. government to support Americans' health-related expenses.</p>
<p>He appointed his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton, to lead a healthcare reform effort. Hillary Clinton, a lawyer, had led a similar effort to reform education in Arkansas when her husband was governor there.</p>
<p>But some lawmakers in Congress – as well as some voters – rejected her efforts. The reform effort failed.</p>
<p>Clinton also struggled in some early foreign policy moves. He withdrew American troops from Somalia after their humanitarian efforts there turned into a bloody military struggle.</p>
<p>He was also criticized for failing to intervene quickly in the genocide in Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of people were killed.</p>
<p>Later, Clinton won praise for some of his foreign policy. His government helped restore the elected president in Haiti after a coup. It also helped negotiate peace agreements in Bosnia and Ireland. And it cooperated with NATO to intervene in the Kosovo area and stop attacks on Albanians there.</p>
<p>In general, Clinton believed the U.S. had an important role to play in maintaining peace and protecting human life around the world. At the same time, he did not want to use too many American resources to do so. He aimed to cooperate with other nations, and to set moderate goals.</p>
<p>As usual, Clinton adopted an approach that was not too extreme on one side or another.</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment</strong></p>
<p>During most of his time as president, Clinton had been under investigation. Federal judges had appointed a special counsel, named Kenneth Starr, to find out if the president had committed any crimes related to financial investments before he took office.</p>
<p>During the investigation, Starr learned that the president had been having a sexual relationship with a young woman who worked in the White House. Starr asked Clinton about the affair under oath.</p>
<p>Later, Starr accused Clinton of lying about his relationship with the woman. Starr said that Clinton had also tried to prevent others from telling the truth about some of his activities.</p>
<p>In time, the president publicly admitted the relationship, and he apologized to voters and his family. But he said he had not lied or told anyone else to lie for him.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the House of Representatives did not accept Clinton's defense. They advanced two articles of impeachment.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate then considered the case. It is their job to examine the evidence and decide whether to remove a president from office. A majority did not believe the actions Clinton was accused of were serious violations against the country. They voted to acquit Clinton of the charges and permit him to continue as president.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>In the U.S., a president can serve only two full terms. After his second, Bill Clinton and his wife settled in a town outside New York City. In time, Hillary Clinton became the U.S. senator from New York, as well as a secretary of state and the Democratic Party's candidate for president.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, like many other U.S. presidents, wrote about his experiences and helped develop his presidential library. He also worked on humanitarian, health, and economic issues with his family's organization, the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>For many, Clinton's time in office is remembered as a mixed experience. The economy was at one of its strongest in U.S. history. Most people could find jobs, and many Americans bought homes for the first time. In the mid-1990s especially, the Internet and other new developments created a technology boom.</p>
<p>In addition, Clinton was an effective public speaker, and he inspired new groups of people to support his Democratic Party. Many voters approved of his appointments of women and minorities to positions of power in his government. They also liked the steps he took to reduce the use of handguns, protect the environment, and provide paid time off work for some people to care for themselves or their families.</p>
<p>But both Democrats and Republicans found fault with some of Clinton's efforts. And even his supporters note that the president had to spend much of his time in office answering charges of wrongdoing.</p>

<span class="byline">By Karen Leggett</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 December 2023</span><br/>
<p><em>Editor's Note: We are pleased to share a traditional holiday story with you, 'The Gift of the Magi' by O. Henry. </em><em>Karen Leggett adapted this story for VOA Learning English. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal. The producer was Lawan Davis.</em></p>
<p>One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it in the smallest pieces of money - pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by <strong>negotiating</strong> with the men at the market who sold vegetables and meat. Negotiating until one's face burned with the silent knowledge of being poor. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Gift of the Magi" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/36fb8ef4-a6ec-4ed7-a573-0924aaa83d0d_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Gift of the Magi</span></div>
<p>There was clearly nothing to do but sit down and cry. So Della cried. Which led to the thought that life is made up of little cries and smiles, with more little cries than smiles.</p>
<p>Della finished her crying and dried her face. She stood by the window and looked out unhappily at a gray cat walking along a gray fence in a gray back yard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only one dollar and eighty-seven cents to buy her husband Jim a gift. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result.</p>
<p>Jim earned twenty dollars a week, which does not go far. Expenses had been greater than she had expected. They always are. Many a happy hour she had spent planning to buy something nice for him. Something fine and rare -- something close to being worthy of the honor of belonging to Jim.</p>
<p>There was a tall glass mirror between the windows of the room. Suddenly Della turned from the window and stood before the glass mirror and looked at herself. Her eyes were shining, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Quickly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. and Mrs. James Dillingham Young had two possessions which they valued. One was Jim's gold time piece, the watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair.</p>
<p>Had the Queen of Sheba lived in their building, Della would have let her hair hang out the window to dry just to reduce the value of the queen's jewels.</p>
<p>So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, shining like a brown waterfall. It reached below her knees and made itself almost like a covering for her. And then quickly she put it up again. She stood still while a few tears fell on the floor.</p>
<p>She put on her coat and her old brown hat. With a quick motion and brightness still in her eyes, she danced out the door and down the street.</p>
<p>Where she stopped the sign read: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." Della ran up the steps to the shop, out of breath.</p>
<p>"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.</p>
<p>"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take your hat off and let us have a look at it."</p>
<p>Down came the beautiful brown waterfall of hair.</p>
<p>"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the hair with an experienced hand.</p>
<p>"Give it to me quick," said Della.</p>
<p>The next two hours went by as if they had wings. Della looked in all the stores to choose a gift for Jim.</p>
<p>She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. It was a chain -- simple round rings of silver. It was perfect for Jim's gold watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be for him. It was like him. Quiet and with great value. She gave the shopkeeper twenty-one dollars and she hurried home with the eighty-seven cents that was left.</p>
<p>When Della arrived home she began to repair what was left of her hair. The hair had been ruined by her love and her desire to give a special gift. Repairing the damage was a very big job.</p>
<p>Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny round curls of hair that made her look wonderfully like a schoolboy. She looked at herself in the glass mirror long and carefully.</p>
<p>"If Jim does not kill me before he takes a second look at me," she said to herself, "he'll say I look like a song girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"</p>
<p>At seven o'clock that night the coffee was made and the pan on the back of the stove was hot and ready to cook the meat.</p>
<p>Jim was never late coming home from work. Della held the silver chain in her hand and sat near the door. Then she heard his step and she turned white for just a minute. She had a way of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please God, make him think I am still pretty."</p>
<p>The door opened and Jim stepped in. He looked thin and very serious. Poor man, he was only twenty-two and he had to care for a wife. He needed a new coat and gloves to keep his hands warm.</p>
<p>Jim stopped inside the door, as <strong>immovable</strong> as a dog smelling a bird. His eyes were fixed upon Della. There was an <strong>expression</strong> in them that she could not read, and it frightened her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor fear, nor any of the feelings that she had been prepared for. He simply looked at her with a strange expression on his face. Della went to him.</p>
<p>"Jim, my love," she cried, "do not look at me that way. I had my hair cut and sold because I could not have lived through Christmas without giving you a gift. My hair will grow out again. I just had to do it. My hair grows very fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let us be happy. You do not know what a nice-- what a beautiful, nice gift I have for you."</p>
<p>"You have cut off your hair?" asked Jim, slowly, as if he had not accepted the information even after his mind worked very hard.</p>
<p>"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Do you not like me just as well? I am the same person without my hair, right?</p>
<p>Jim looked about the room as if he were looking for something.</p>
<p>"You say your hair is gone?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You need not look for it," said Della. "It is sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It is Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it was cut for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the meat on, Jim?"</p>
<p>Jim seemed to awaken quickly and put his arms around Della. Then he took a package from his coat and threw it on the table.</p>
<p>"Do not make any mistake about me, Dell," he said. "I do not think there is any haircut that could make me like my girl any less. But if you will open that package you may see why you had me frightened at first."</p>
<p>White fingers quickly tore at the string and paper. There was a scream of joy; and then, alas! a change to tears and cries, requiring the man of the house to use all his skill to calm his wife.</p>
<p>For there were the combs -- the special set of objects to hold her hair that Della had wanted ever since she saw them in a shop window. Beautiful combs, made of shells, with jewels at the edge --just the color to wear in the beautiful hair that was no longer hers. They cost a lot of money, she knew, and her heart had wanted them without ever hoping to have them. And now, the beautiful combs were hers, but the hair that should have touched them was gone.</p>
<p>But she held the combs to herself, and soon she was able to look up with a smile and say, "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"</p>
<p>Then Della jumped up like a little burned cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"</p>
<p>Jim had not yet seen his beautiful gift. She happily held it out to him in her open hands. The silver chain seemed so bright.</p>
<p>"Isn't it wonderful, Jim? I looked all over town to find it. You will have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."</p>
<p>Instead of obeying, Jim fell on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>
<p>"Dell," said he, "let us put our Christmas gifts away and keep them a while. They are too nice to use just right now. I sold my gold watch to get the money to buy the set of combs for your hair. And now, why not put the meat on."</p>
<p>The <strong>magi</strong> were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought gifts to the Baby Jesus. They invented the art of giving Christmas gifts. Being wise, their gifts were wise ones. And here I have told you the story of two young people who most unwisely gave for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that of all who give gifts, these two were the wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>

        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

<span class="byline">By VOA</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>
In 1822, an American professor named Clement Clarke Moore wrote a poem that redefined the image of Saint Nicholas. It was called "Account of a Visit from Saint Nicholas." He did not expect it to be published. He wrote it as a Christmas present for his young children. In recent years, experts have questioned whether Moore actually wrote the poem.</p>
<p>Some believe it was written by Henry Livingston, a map maker in New York who wrote and published funny poems in his spare time.</p>
<p>But whoever wrote this classic poem, it has since become a favorite around the world. This poem combines the traditions of Santa Claus, seasonal decorations and gift-giving that have come to define Christmas in America.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/9BC4B48F-8C2D-4097-B73E-B411786E115D_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">VOA Learning English Presents 'A Visit From St. Nicholas'</span></div>
<p>We give you the staff of Learning English reading Clement Clarke Moore's poem, popularly known as "'Twas the Night Before Christmas."</p>
<p>
<em>‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br/>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br/>
In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.</em></p>
<p><em>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br/>
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.<br/>
And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,<br/>
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.</em></p>
<p><em>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br/>
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br/>
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br/>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</em></p>
<p><em>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Gave lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
When, what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br/>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.</em></p>
<p><em>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.<br/>
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br/>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!</em></p>
<p><em>"Now Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!<br/>
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!<br/>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</em></p>
<p><em>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br/>
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br/>
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br/>
With the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.</em></p>
<p><em>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br/>
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br/>
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br/>
Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.</em></p>
<p><em>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br/>
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br/>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br/>
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.</em></p>
<p><em>His eyes -- how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br/>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.</em></p>
<p><em>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br/>
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br/>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br/>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</em></p>
<p><em>He spoke not a word, and went straight to his work,<br/>
Filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br/>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!</em></p>
<p><em>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</em></p>
<p><em>Dorothy Gundy produced the video.</em></p>

<span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">23 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about the word "season." We use this word in many different ways.</p>
<p>"Season" can <strong>refer to </strong>one of the four parts of the year. For example, Washington, D.C. is in a part of the United States that has four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Some parts of the U.S. do not have four seasons.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A diver dressed as Santa Claus performs amongst fish during a Christmas-themed underwater show at an aquarium in Seoul, South Korea on December 4, 2019.

" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/A98A677E-54CF-4C5F-867A-156CD807A4D4_cx6_cy0_cw91_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A diver dressed as Santa Claus performs amongst fish during a Christmas-themed underwater show at an aquarium in Seoul, South Korea on December 4, 2019.

</span></div>
<p>"Season" can also describe the periods marked by warmth and growth or cold weather and falling leaves. For example, when the weather becomes warmer and days are lighter longer, the growing season begins for some plants. When the weather gets colder and the days darker, the <strong>hibernation</strong> season begins for some animals.</p>
<p>We also use "season" to describe periods that are only related to the weather. For example, some areas of the world have <u>rainy seasons</u> and <u>dry seasons</u>. Some parts of the U.S. have <u>tornado season</u>. And in other parts of the world there are <u>monsoon seasons</u>.</p>
<p>"Season" can also refer to the time before and during a major holiday. December is a busy <u>holiday season</u> in many parts of the world. Holidays include Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Winter Solstice. December is often a time to take a break from work and spend time with loved ones.</p>
<p>Speaking of Christmas, when we say <u>‘tis the season</u> we are talking about something dealing with this holiday – its good side and its not-so-good side. For example, let's say I give a co-worker a big box of homemade cookies. They might say to me, "Thanks! But why are you giving me so many cookies?" I can answer, "'Tis the season!"</p>
<p>Here is another example. If I go out to a store and it is packed with holiday shoppers, I could <strong>complain</strong> to a friend. And they could respond, "Well, ‘tis the season!" What they <em>really </em>mean is this: At this time of the year, stores are usually very busy with Christmas shoppers.</p>
<p>In fact, Christmas is like <u>open season</u> on shopping deals. "Open season on" something means that it is being hunted, targeted, or in this case ... bought.</p>
<p>"Open season" also describes a period of time when a particular activity or opportunity is unrestricted. It is widely available. This term probably comes from hunting. Hunting traditionally has many restrictions. People can hunt only at certain times of the year and even then, there are restrictions on which animals and how many you can hunt. Fishing too has similar restrictions. But if it is open season, there are few restrictions.</p>
<p>As in our earlier shopping example, we can use this term for just about anything that is targeted with few restrictions. When talking about the best times to travel, for example, it is a good idea to travel <u>off-season</u>. If few people are traveling, it is a good time to find <strong>cheap</strong> air travel, hotels, and <strong>rental</strong> cars. It is open season on travel deals.</p>
<p>And like <u>hunting season</u>, we can have other "seasons" too. For example, beach areas are popular during <u>tourist season</u>. And people with <strong>allergies</strong> probably do not like <u>hay fever season</u> or <u>allergy season</u>.</p>
<p>So, "season" can simply mean a time of the year marked by a special activity. Sports seasons, for example, are popular with fans of sports.</p>
<p>We also have different seasons in our lives: Our time as children, going off to college, becoming parents, helping our aging parents, starting new careers or starting retirement. These are all different seasons of life. And they all have different <strong>aspects</strong> to enjoy and to be thankful for.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time ...</p>

<p>VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about George Walker Bush. He took office in 2001 as the 43rd president.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - George W. Bush" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/39fec087-a03f-4396-8a32-cdca08f06a08_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - George W. Bush</span></div>
<p>He has a similar name to another president -- his father, George Herbert Walker Bush.</p>
<p>To simplify things, Americans sometimes call the younger Bush "43," or simply "W." Here we will just call him Bush.</p>
<p>Because Bush is a recent president, historians have not reached a broad agreement on his time as a leader.</p>
<p>But he will surely be remembered for facing one of the biggest challenges to any president: the attacks against the U.S. on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>George Bush was born in the northeast state of Connecticut. But his parents soon moved to the southwest state of Texas. George grew up there and considered Texas home.</p>
<p>The Bush family had a long background in politics. Bush's grandfather was a senator. His father held many public offices. In some ways, George was prepared for a career in politics, too.</p>
<p>He went to the same private <strong>boarding school</strong> as his father. Then, like his father and grandfather, George went to Yale for college. He also worked on several political campaigns. But he said he did not consider pursuing politics.</p>
<p>Instead, he earned a degree in business at Harvard and took a job in an oil company in Texas. In time, he founded his own oil business.</p>
<p>And he married <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/laura-welch-bush/">Laura Welch</a>, who was a teacher and librarian in their hometown. They had <strong>twin </strong>daughters named Barbara and Jenna.</p>
<p>In these years as a young adult, Bush began to make some changes. He began attending a Christian church regularly. He decided to stop drinking alcohol because it was creating problems in his personal life. And he turned his attention to politics.</p>
<p>Bush lost the first election in which he competed, a race to become a member of Congress. So, for a while, he focused on business investments and helping his father's political career.</p>
<p>But in 1992, his father lost re-election to the presidency. And the younger Bush saw a chance to enter politics himself again. In 1994, Bush ran for governor of Texas. To many people's surprise, he won.</p>
<p>Four years later, he was overwhelmingly re-elected. Many voters liked his image as, what he called, a "<strong>compassionate</strong> conservative." In other words, he wanted to use traditional Republican ideas about government to help society.</p>
<p>Following two successful terms as governor, Bush turned his attention to the presidency. In 2000, he competed against the vice president at the time, Al Gore. The winner was not announced until more than a month following the election – usually, the winner is announced within hours.</p>
<p>Both sides disputed the process of counting votes in the state of Florida. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the process. The Court ordered state officials to stop re-counting votes. Bush's lead stood.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Bush entered office expecting to bring many of the ideas he pursued in Texas to the entire nation. For example, as president he permitted religious groups to receive government funding, and set national standards for public schools.</p>
<p>These moves were popular with many voters. But they also challenged some American traditions: the separation of church and state, and the ability of public schools to govern themselves.</p>
<p>For many presidents, these policies might have created a <strong>legacy</strong>. But early in Bush's term, he faced a crisis that defined much of his time in office.</p>
<p>Hijackers linked to the al-Qaeda group seized four airplanes on September 11, 2001. They purposely crashed two planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, eventually killing more than 2,700 people.</p>
<p>Another plane was flown into the Pentagon, the country's military headquarters outside of Washington, DC. About 200 people died there.</p>
<p>The fourth plane was aimed at another important target. But passengers fought the hijackers. The plane lost control and crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. All 44 people on board died there.</p>
<p>President Bush was visiting an elementary school in Florida that morning. He learned about the attacks while he was reading with the children.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Bush spoke to the nation. He said the U.S. would answer both the terrorist groups and the countries that permitted terrorist groups to <strong>thrive</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the next years, Bush took a number of actions to create a new national security strategy. They included creating a Department of Homeland Security, making changes to the country's intelligence operations, and reforming the U.S. military.</p>
<p>He also sent U.S. forces into Afghanistan to destroy terrorist networks there. Bush was especially targeting the person who had designed the September 11 terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>The struggle in Afghanistan was successful at first, but continued throughout Bush's time in office. And bin Laden was not captured while Bush was president.</p>
<p>In 2003, Bush opened another front on what some called the "war on terror." He and other government officials said the leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was developing weapons that could kill many people. They said Hussein – and his connections to terrorist groups – threatened Americans and people in other countries.</p>
<p>Hussein did not agree to leave Iraq. So U.S. and British forces launched bombs at targets in the country's capital. Additional troops destroyed what was left of the targets. Hussein was quickly overthrown.</p>
<p>But the weapons of mass destruction were not found.</p>
<p>For the rest of Bush's presidency, U.S. forces remained in Iraq. Bush promised that Americans would stabilize the country and help Iraqis create a democratic government.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>The presidency of George W. Bush is too recent to understand its impact. But there is some evidence of the public's reaction at the time.</p>
<p>Bush received some of the highest ratings of any president. In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, 90 percent approved of his leadership.</p>
<p>He was re-elected in 2004. But his popularity steadily decreased .</p>
<p>At the end of his second term, he had one of the lowest public approval ratings of any president: 33 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy had entered a recession. More Americans disagreed especially with his decision to invade Iraq. And some criticized his government for responding too slowly after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and the country's Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Since Bush left the White House in 2009, his approval ratings have – like those of many presidents – risen again. He has mostly avoided public appearances. Instead, he has enjoyed playing sports, helping charities, and reading U.S. history.</p>
<p>He also began a new hobby: painting. He has created <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/president-george-bush-portraits-of-courage/3748579.html">portraits</a> of dozens of veterans to honor their service in the military.</p>

            <title>South African Company to Make Rings that Protect Against HIV  (2023/12/23)</title>

<p>A South African company will make <strong>vaginal</strong> devices that protect against HIV. Medical experts say that should at some point make them less costly and more easily available.</p>
<p>HIV is a virus that causes AIDS, a serious disease that affects the body's natural defense system, or immune system.</p>
<p>The Population Council is an international nonprofit that does medical research. It announced recently that the South African healthcare company Kiara Health will start making the devices, or rings, from the medical product silicone in the next few years. It estimates that 1 million could be produced each year.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman dances as she listens to music while attending a World AIDS Day commemoration at Nkosi's Haven in Johannesburg on Nov. 30, 2019 on the eve of World AIDS Day.

<p>The devices release a drug that helps prevent HIV infections. They are approved by nearly 12 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The nonprofit group owns the rights to the ring, which are now made by a Swedish company. About 500,000 rings are currently available to women in Africa at no cost, bought by donors.</p>
<p>Ben Phillips is a spokesman at the U.N. AIDS agency. He said the ring gives women the freedom to use it without anyone else's knowledge or agreement.</p>
<p>"For women whose partners won't use a condom or <strong>allow</strong> them to take <strong>oral</strong> (preventative HIV) medicines, this gives them another option," he said. A condom is a device worn by a male partner to prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexual diseases.</p>
<p>HIV remains the leading cause of death among women of <strong>reproductive</strong> age in Africa. And 60 percent of new infections are in women, information from WHO shows.</p>
<p>The ring releases the drug dapivirine in small amounts over a month. It currently costs $12 to $16, but experts expect the price to drop once it is widely produced in Africa. Developers are also working on a version that will last up to three months, which should also lower the yearly cost.</p>
<p>WHO has suggested the ring be used as an additional tool for women at high risk of HIV. Officials in more than 12 African countries, including South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe have also approved it.</p>
<p>WHO pointed to two studies in its approval, saying the ring reduced women's chances of getting HIV by about a third. While other research has suggested the risk could be dropped by more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, I'm Caty Weaver.</p>
<p>Today, Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith present a special program on Christmas traditions in the United States during the first half of the 19th century.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Santa Claus drives his reindeer and sleigh float along Central Park West during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023, in New York.

</span></div>
<p>During this period, there was no set way of celebrating the day, which was not yet an official holiday. Communities around the country honored the day in different ways. Some observed Christmas as an important Christian religious day honoring the birth of Jesus. Others celebrated the day with parties, music, drinking and eating. And, some communities did not celebrate the day at all.</p>
<p>But, it was during this period that Americans began to reinvent the holiday. They combined ancient Christmas traditions from different cultures with modern American influences.</p>
<p>Here are Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith.</p>
<p>In 1819, the popular American writer Washington Irving wrote a series of five essays<strong> </strong>published in a book called <em>The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent</em>.</p>
<p>The essays describe a wealthy British landowner who invites his farm workers into his home to celebrate Christmas. The landowner recreates a traditional Christmas as it would have been celebrated in the distant past. Irving praised this looking back to ancient traditions. He liked the idea of different levels of <strong>society</strong> coming together to enjoy a<strong> festive</strong> and peaceful holiday. Washington Irving seemed to express concern about the lack of such <strong>unifying </strong>Christmas traditions in modern America.</p>
<p><strong>Immigrants shape Christmas traditions</strong></p>
<p>Penne Restad wrote a book <em>Christmas in America: A History</em>. It shows how Americans began to slowly shape Christmas into a unifying national holiday during the first half of the 19th century. She describes how Christmas had different meanings for Americans who came from different cultural and religious backgrounds. Many immigrants brought Christmas traditions from their own countries.</p>
<p>Religion played a big role in how an American might celebrate the holiday. Calvinist Christians banned the celebration of Christmas. But groups such as Episcopalians and Moravians honored the day with religious services and seasonal <strong>decorations</strong>.</p>
<p>By mid-century, Christian groups began to ignore their religious differences over the meaning of Christmas and honored the day in special ways.</p>
<p>Christmas became an important time for families to celebrate at home. More and more Christian Americans also began to follow the European traditions of Christmas trees and giving gifts. Christians believed that the tree represented Jesus and was also a sign of new beginnings. German immigrants brought their tradition of putting lights, sweets and toys on the branches of evergreen trees placed in their homes.</p>
<p>This tradition of setting up a Christmas tree soon spread to many American homes. So did the <strong>practice</strong> of giving people presents. As these traditions increased in popularity, the modern trade and business linked to Christmas also grew.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas as a holiday</strong></p>
<p>As Christmas became more popular, some states declared the day a state holiday. Louisiana was the first state to make the move in 1837. By 1860, 14 other states had followed. It was not until 1870 that President Ulysses Grant made Christmas a federal holiday.</p>
<p>Americans already knew old Christmas songs that came from England and other areas of Europe. But many new American Christmas songs started to become popular. For example, in eighteen forty-nine, a religious leader from Massachusetts wrote the words to <em>It Came Upon a Midnight Clear</em>.The song <em>J</em><em>ingle Bells </em>appeared seven years later. And, a year later, a religious leader in Williamsport, Pennsylvania wrote the song <em>We Three Kings of Orient Are</em>.</p>
<p>And of course, no discussion of Christmas would be complete without talking about of one of the holiday's most famous representations, Santa Claus.</p>
<p>This character is based on the story of Saint Nicholas, a Christian holy person believed to have lived in the third century. Saint Nicholas became known as a protector of children. Different cultures have given him different names. These include Sinterklaas, Kris Kringle and Father Christmas. But for most Americans his most popular name would become Santa Claus.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, many Dutch immigrants living in the United States celebrated the feast of Saint Nicholas on December 6. Saint Nicholas was especially important to New Yorkers because of their history as a Dutch colony. In 1809, Washington Irving published his <em>History of New York</em>. It lists Saint Nicholas as the patron saint of New Yorkers. He describes the saint wearing a low hat, large pants, and smoking a pipe. Does this description sound familiar?</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the words "assessment" and "evaluation."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>What is difference between Assessment and evaluation?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Assessment &amp; Evaluation" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-f32e-08dc0101902a_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Assessment &amp; Evaluation</span></div>
<p>Noor</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, Noor. This is a good question.</p>
<p>Many people use the terms assessment and evaluation interchangeably. That means they see little or no difference between them in most cases. The terms are related. They both involve performance and education, but they are not the same thing. It is a mistake to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Assessment <strong>focuses on</strong> student learning, documenting what students know and what they can do. Assessment has many purposes. They include finding out a student's overall ability, measuring to what <strong>degree</strong> a student has gained control of an identified set of <strong>criteria</strong>, and providing students with information about their strengths and weaknesses. Assessment is a continual process. Its goal is to help students improve.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences using assessment.</p>
<p><em>Teachers should use classroom assessments to inform instruction.</em></p>
<p><em>The students completed a weekly assessment.</em></p>
<p><em>The school uses a variety of assessment tools.</em></p>
<p>Evaluation often focuses on the performance of an organization. Evaluation involves using criteria and evidence to find out if an organization is meeting its goals. Evaluation only happens at set times, and its goal is to judge the quality of an organization. Assessment can be a part of the evaluation process. That is because assessment results are often used to make judgements.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences using evaluation.</p>
<p><em>The class was canceled due to results from the curriculum evaluation.</em></p>
<p><em>The school district completed its special education program evaluation last month.</em></p>
<p><em>The governor focused on the lack of school counseling evaluations.</em></p>
<p>Although assessment and evaluation are both used in education and relate to measuring performance, they have different focuses, purposes, timing, and <strong>outcomes</strong>. The terms are also used a lot in other fields such as finance, medicine and engineering.</p>

            <title>Those Who Fear Illness Die Earlier  (2023/12/22)</title>

<p>A large Swedish study has found an unexpected finding about people diagnosed with extreme fear of serious illness. It found they are more likely to die earlier than people who are not as concerned about their health.</p>
<p>Hypochondriasis, now called illness anxiety disorder, is a rare condition with <strong>symptoms</strong> that go beyond average health concerns. People with the disorder are unable to lose their fears despite normal doctor visits and lab tests. Some may change doctors repeatedly. Others may avoid medical care.</p>
<p>Dr. Jonathan E. Alpert of Montefiore Medical Center in New York said, "Many of us are mild hypochondriacs." But he added there are also people on the extreme side of it who are always worrying and thinking about whether they have a serious illness.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A hospital exam room is seen in Alabama on Thursday, July 30, 2015. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/889255c8-cb5a-4351-9fb4-3f42b57d27d5_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A hospital exam room is seen in Alabama on Thursday, July 30, 2015. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)</span></div>
<p>People with the disorder are suffering and "it's important to take it seriously and to treat it," said Alpert, who was not involved in the new study. Treatment can include behavioral <strong>therapy</strong>, calming methods, education, and sometimes mental health medication.</p>
<p>The researchers have found that people with the condition have an increased risk of death from both natural and unnatural causes, including suicide. Continuing<strong> stress</strong> and its effects on the body could explain some of the differences, the writers said. The study was published recently in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>.</p>
<p>David Mataix-Cols of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden led the research. "We got lucky," he said, because the Swedish system for organizing disease has a separate entry for hypochondriasis. That permitted research on thousands of people over 24 years, from 1997 to 2020.</p>
<p>Older research had suggested the risk of suicide might be lower for people with the condition. Mataix-Cols said their research found that statement was incorrect. In the study, the risk of suicide death was four times higher for people with the condition.</p>
<p>They looked at 4,100 people with hypochondriasis and <strong>matched</strong> them with 41,000 people similar in age, sex, and where they lived. They used a measurement called person years, which measures the number of people and how long they were followed.</p>
<p>Overall death rates were higher in the people with hypochondriasis, 8.5 instead of 5.5 per 1,000 person years. People with the condition died younger than the others, with a <strong>mean</strong> age of 70 instead of 75. The risk of death from diseases related to body systems, such as breathing and eating, was higher. The risk of death from cancer, however, was about the same.</p>
<p>Alpert leads the American Psychiatric Association's group on research. He said more care is needed when suggesting a patient to mental health professionals. Patients can become angry because they feel they are being accused of imagining symptoms.</p>
<p>Alpert added, "... <strong>fortunately</strong>, there are good treatments."</p>

            <title>Thailand Pushes ‘Land Bridge’ to Speed Trade  (2023/12/22)</title>

<p>Thailand is looking for investment to build a "land bridge" across the narrow southern part of the country. The Southeast Asian nation hopes to provide a shorter path for <strong>cargo</strong> between the Pacific and Indian oceans without having to go through the Malacca Strait and Singapore.</p>
<p>Under the plan, cargo would travel by highway and railroad from the area of Chumpon on the Gulf of Thailand to Ranong on the Indian Ocean to be loaded onto waiting ships.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been seeking support for the $28-billion project from investors around the world. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in San Francisco, Srettha said the land bridge would connect the oceans "without requiring ships to sail down along the tip of Singapore, known to experience <strong>congestion</strong> and would cut transport <strong>duration</strong>." He called it a "very important project, not just for Thailand, but also for the world."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Thailand is looking for investment to build a land bridge across its southern neck, which would cut cargo transit times.

<p>Thailand says it is open to interest from all investors. After a meeting with Japanese businesses and leaders, Srettha said there was interest in the project without providing additional information. Thai transport minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said more than 10 American companies expressed interest without naming them.</p>
<p><strong>China's interest in the area</strong></p>
<p>China, an important trade nation in the area, has not commented on the plan for the land bridge.</p>
<p>For many years, Chinese businesses have been pushing for a deepwater project called the Kra Canal. The canal would cross the Kra Isthmus and would permit large ships to pass. The proposed project would cut at least one day of sailing time from passing through the Malacca Strait.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha set up a Chinese-supported center to study the canal idea. But it has never started because of the cost and possible environmental damage.</p>
<p>Sompong Putivisutisak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University, has studied the land bridge proposal. Sompong said, "(China) won't give away its position that easily until it sees the other investors."</p>
<p>He told VOA there are two reasons that China would invest in the land bridge project: "First, financial <strong>benefits</strong>, secondly geopolitics. Financially, this project is not worth the investment, but geopolitically it could be interesting as China would have control over both seas."</p>
<p>At a Belt and Road Initiative meeting in Beijing last October, Thai officials said the land bridge could be connected to another high-speed railway under construction from Thailand to Singapore. Srettha even drew a map of the route during a meeting, which he posted online.</p>
<p>But critics say the plan is unlikely to win China's full backing. They say a land bridge would require loading and unloading cargo from ships and would not save any time.</p>
<p>Somboon Kamhang, chairman of the Coordinating Committee on Development, called it "another dreamy project." He told VOA, "China isn't interested in the land bridge project. Building a land bridge is just way too costly and <strong>time-consuming</strong>, but China can get behind the canal idea which could give it more control over the region."</p>

<p>The European Union has reached an agreement that sets new rules for controlling migration.</p>
<p>The deal, announced Wednesday, will become part of an EU agreement called the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. <em>The Associated Press </em>reported the document will need to get final EU approval by February and is expected to enter into force by June.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the agreement is to set new rules to ease difficulties facing EU nations as they seek to deal with migrant arrivals. The deal also aims to establish a process for EU nations to more fairly share the duties and costs related to migration.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Federal Police attempt to find a group of migrants who illegally crossed the border from Poland into Germany, while on patrol in a forest near Forst south east of Berlin, Germany, on Oct. 11, 2023.

<p>The laws cover <strong>screening</strong> policies for when migrants first arrive in the EU. They also provide rules relating to migrants seeking asylum and set guidelines for processing <strong>applications</strong> and dealing with possible migration crises.</p>
<p>"It's truly a historic day," European Parliament President Roberta Metsola told reporters in Brussels after the negotiations. She added that reaching an agreement was important because migration is likely to be a major campaign issue ahead of EU elections in June.</p>
<p>"Let's not underestimate the risk if we had not reached such a deal," Metsola said. She added that she hopes the agreement will persuade EU members not to establish individual borders because the migration flows can now be more effectively dealt with.</p>
<p>Migrant arrivals in the EU are down from a high in 2015 of more than 1 million. Most of those migrants entering Europe were fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. But the flows started to increase in recent years and reached 255,000 so far this year through November, Reuters news agency reported. More than half of these crossed the Mediterranean from Africa, mainly to Italy.</p>
<p>Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi called the deal a "great success" for Europe and Italy. He said it should help EU border countries most involved with migration feel less alone.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said finding agreement on migration disputes was very important and can help lighten the load for the most affected EU states, including Germany.</p>
<p>Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he sees the deal improving "control over migration" and providing a better asylum process for migrants to the EU. Far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders aims to replace Rutte after winning the country's elections last month on a campaign that included anti-migration policies.</p>
<p>Under the new system, countries not at the EU border will have to choose between accepting their share of 30,000 asylum applicants or paying nearly 22,000 euros per person to the EU.</p>
<p>The screening system seeks to separate those in need of international protection from others who are not.</p>
<p>People whose asylum applications have a low chance of approval – such as those from India, Tunisia or Turkey – can be prevented from entering the EU and detained at the border. People seen as representing a threat to security can also be held at the border. The agreement also sets policies for speeding up the processing of applications.</p>
<p>While praised by many European leaders, the agreement also received criticism from groups seeking to assist migrants.</p>
<p>The European Council on Refugees and Exiles – a migrant rights organization – condemned the proposed rules on X, formerly Twitter. The group said the policies were "Byzantine in their complexity and Orban-esque in their cruelty." The message was commenting on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who ordered the building of security fences to keep migrants out of the country.</p>
<p>Rights group Amnesty International said it sees the deal setting EU asylum law back many years and leading to greater suffering for people seeking asylum. It also said the agreement is likely to cause more people "to be put into <strong>de facto</strong> detention" at the EU's borders, including families with children and other "<strong>vulnerable</strong>" individuals.</p>

<span class="byline">By Faith Pirlo</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Many Americans will travel over the winter holidays, often to return to the homes and towns of their childhood. For people from the state of West Virginia, and wider <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/discover-americas-appalachian-trial/2766408.html">Appalachia</a>, one song comes to mind on the trip home: <em>Take Me Home, Country Roads</em>.<em> </em>Singer John Denver co-wrote and performed the 1971 song. It became a major hit.</p>
<p>Recently, my favorite singer, Lana Del Rey, recorded her version of the song after performing in West Virginia in October.</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will look at parts of the song performed by Del Rey and connect it to grammar and <strong>figurative</strong> language.<strong> </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Grammar and Figurative Language in " country="" home="" me="" roads="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-d776-08dc01aef575_w268_r1.png" take=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Grammar and Figurative Language in "Take Me Home, Country Roads" </span></div>
<p>Let's look at the first <strong>verse</strong> of the song.</p>
<p><strong>Metaphors, appositives, and comparative adjectives</strong></p>
<p><em>Almost Heaven, West Virginia</em></p>
<p><em>Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River</em></p>
<p><em>Life is old there, older than the trees</em></p>
<p><em>Younger than the mountains, growing like a <strong>breeze</strong></em></p>
<p>In the first verse we have a couple of comparisons. One comparison uses an appositive as <strong>metaphor</strong>. The others use comparative adjectives and even a <strong>simile</strong>.</p>
<p>Appositives are nouns or noun phrases that go beside another noun to describe it. Sometimes we can use the appositive structure to create a metaphor.</p>
<p>"Almost Heaven, West Virginia" is a metaphor using an appositive. Here, our subject is "West Virginia" and the appositive is "Almost Heaven." The appositive is giving more information about "West Virginia." The comma takes the place of the typical verb used to make metaphors, "be."</p>
<p><em>West Virginia is almost Heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Almost Heaven, West Virginia</em></p>
<p>"Heaven" is a perfect place. Many cultures and traditions uphold it as a beautiful, holy place people go when they die.</p>
<p>So, if West Virginia is "almost heaven," its natural landscape of mountains and rivers and trees must be a holy place of beauty.</p>
<p>Next, we have a comparison of "life" in West Virginia. It is "older than the trees" and "younger than the mountains." "Older" and "younger" are comparative adjectives.</p>
<p>Comparative adjectives compare one thing to another. They help express whether something has more or less of a <strong>particular </strong>quality.</p>
<p>The song suggests the ancient history of the land. Scientists say the mountains began to develop about a billion years ago. Life began sometime after that but before the growth of trees, the song goes.</p>
<p>And the mountains and life continue into the future, the song then suggests. The writers used the simile, "growing like a breeze," to express this idea.</p>
<p>A simile is a figure of speech in which unlike things are compared with the use of the words "like" or "as."</p>
<p>Breezes come and go and sometimes grow into a stronger wind. This verse could mean that life and land grow with ease in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Let's move onto the <strong>chorus</strong> of the song.</p>
<p><strong>Imperatives and personification </strong></p>
<p><em>Country roads, take me home</em></p>
<p><em>To the place I belong</em></p>
<p><em>West Virginia, mountain mama</em></p>
<p><em>Take me home, country roads</em></p>
<p>In the chorus of the song, we have an interesting grammatical feature and some figurative language.</p>
<p>We have an imperative structure that is repeated in the beginning and end of the chorus:</p>
<p><em>Country roads, take me home</em></p>
<p><em>Take me home, country roads</em></p>
<p>Imperatives are predicate-only clauses used to give instruction, direction or command. Imperative sentences use the base form of the verb and may have other information.</p>
<p>We know that this song was written about a road trip through the mountains and rural communities. The singer seeks direction from the "country roads," themselves, to find the way home.</p>
<p>We also have more figurative language. The writers refer to West Virginia as "mountain mama." This is an example of personification or the human representation of a non-living thing.</p>
<p>The reference humanizes West Virginia and suggests that it is the mother of mountains. But, it uses the more childlike term, "mama" for mother. The word expresses hominess, warmth and <strong>nostalgia</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Today we looked at the beloved song <em>Country Roads</em>. We found figurative language like metaphors using appositives and personification, which is the humanizing of non-living things.</p>
<p>We even found some interesting grammar with the use of comparative adjectives like "younger" and "older" to describe life in West Virginia and imperatives or commands to give direction through the "country roads."</p>

<p>And I'm Anna Mateo. And we're both from West Virginia.</p>

<p>The U.S. space agency says an orange cat named Taters is the star of the first video sent by laser from deep space.<br/>
美国航天局表示，第一段由激光从外太空发送的视频的主角是一只名叫“土豆”的橘猫。</p>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft sent the 15-second video to Earth from 30 million kilometers in space. The video shows Taters as he chases a red laser light.<br/>
美国宇航局的普赛克飞船从3000万公里外的太空向地球发送了这段15秒的视频。视频显示“土豆”在追逐红色激光灯。</p>
<p>It took less than two minutes for the video to reach Caltech's Palomar Observatory. The video quality is called ultra high-definition. It was sent at the test system's maximum rate of 267 megabits per second.<br/>
这段视频传输到加州理工学院的帕洛玛天文台花了不到两分钟时间。这种视频质量被称为超高清。它是以该测试系统每秒267兆的最大速率发送的。</p>
<p>NASA loaded the video into Psyche's laser communication experiment before launching the spacecraft to visit a rare metal asteroid in October. The mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, decided to use an employee's three-year-old cat.<br/>
美国宇航局在10月发射普赛克飞船前往一颗稀有金属小行星，在此之前，它将视频加载到了飞船的激光通信实验中。位于加利福尼亚州帕萨迪纳的美国宇航局喷气推进实验室的任务团队决定使用一名员工的三岁猫。</p>
<p>The video was sent to Earth on December 11 and was released by NASA this week. The test sent the video faster than most internet connections here on Earth, said project leader Ryan Rogalin.<br/>
该视频于12月11日发送到地球，并于本周由美国宇航局发布。项目负责人瑞恩·罗加林说，这次实验发送视频的速度比地球上大多数互联网连接的速度都快。</p>
<p>NASA wants to improve communications from deep space as it prepares efforts to send astronauts to the moon and possibly to the planet Mars. The laser test is meant to send data at rates up to 100 times greater than the radio systems currently used by spacecraft far from Earth.<br/>
美国宇航局希望改善深空通信，为将宇航员送上月球和火星做准备。这次激光实验旨在以比目前远离地球的航天器使用的无线电系统高出100倍的速率发送数据。</p>
<p>More tests are planned as Psyche heads towards the main area of asteroids between the planets Mars and Jupiter. But Taters will not be making anymore appearances, JPL said.<br/>
喷气推进实验室表示，随着普赛克飞船前往火星和木星之间小行星的主要区域，计划进行更多实验。但是“土豆”不会再出现了。</p>
<p>Joby Harris is an art director in JPL's DesignLab. He could not be any happier, but he does not want his cat's new public attention to go to his head.<br/>
乔比·哈里斯是喷气推进实验室设计实验室的艺术总监。他再高兴不过了，但他不想让他的猫再次受到公众关注。</p>
<p>"I'm celebrating his spotlight with him but making sure he keeps his paws on the carpet," Harris said in an email Tuesday.<br/>

<span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">20 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) became a popular subject in 2023. Still, the technology has a long way to go to meet people's futuristic expectations of human-like machines.</p>
<p>ChatGPT was central to this year's attention on AI. The <strong>chatbot </strong>showed the world recent developments in computer science, although not everyone understood quite how it works or what to do with it.</p>
<p>AI scientist Fei-Fei Li suggested that 2023 would be remembered for the great changes in technology as well as the public awakening. It was a year for people to figure out "what this is, how to use it, what's the <strong>impact </strong>— all the good, the bad and the ugly," she added.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone with an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT's Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston.

<p><strong>Concerns over AI</strong></p>
<p>The first AI concerns of 2023 began soon after New Year's Day. That is when classrooms reopened and schools from Seattle to Paris started blocking ChatGPT. Students were already asking the chatbot — released in late 2022 — to write papers and answer take-home tests.</p>
<p>AI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by predicting the next word in a sentence. The models make such predictions after having "learned" the structure of a huge number of human-written works. The large language models often get facts wrong. But the results appeared so natural that it created interest in the next AI developments and possible uses for trickery and <strong>deception</strong>.</p>
<p>Worries grew as this new group of generative AI tools produced not just words but also images, music and voices. They seemed to threaten the jobs of anyone who writes, draws, and creates music and computer languages. Concerns about AI tools fueled strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal disputes from artists to writers.</p>
<p>Some of the most respected AI scientists warned that the technology's progress was marching toward outsmarting humans and possibly threatening their existence. Yet other scientists called the warnings overblown and brought attention to more immediate risks.</p>
<p>By spring, AI-created videos known as deepfakes had appeared in U.S. election campaigns. Deepfakes are videos that contain realistic images but with digital changes to people's actions and speech. One deepfake falsely showed Donald Trump <strong>embracing</strong> the nation's former top infectious disease expert. The technology made it increasingly difficult to tell the difference between real and fake videos of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the AI crisis affected ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI. The San Francisco-based company led by chief executive Sam Altman was nearly destroyed by disagreements over its mission.</p>
<p>AI debates also led to new laws from the European Union and consideration from others, including the United States Congress.</p>
<p><strong>Too much excitement?</strong></p>
<p>AI products released in 2023 have brought technology achievements not possible in earlier times. But the market research company Gartner says they arrive with "inflated expectations" and "massive claims" about its abilities.</p>
<p>Gartner analyst Dave Micko said leading AI developers are pushing the latest technology with their current line of products, including search engines and workplace productivity software.</p>
<p>He said, "As much as Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Apple would love us to adopt the way that they think about their technology and that they deliver that technology, I think adoption actually comes from the bottom up."</p>
<p>It is easy to forget that this is not the first appearance of AI in business. The technology has been used to help guide self-driving cars, compare objects and individual faces, and recognize speech in software like Siri and Alexa.</p>
<p>In 2011, Tom Gruber launched Siri, which was bought and used by Apple in the iPhone. At that time, it was the only major use of AI that people had ever experienced.</p>
<p>But Gruber believes what's happening now is the "biggest wave ever" in AI, launching new possibilities as well as dangers.</p>
<p>The dangers could come fast in 2024. Major national elections in the U.S., India and elsewhere could get flooded with AI-created deepfakes.</p>
<p>In the longer term, AI technology's rapidly improving language, visual sensing and step-by-step planning abilities could create a kind of digital assistant — but only if given access to the "inner loop of our digital life stream," Gruber said.</p>
<p>"They can <strong>manage </strong>your attention as in, ‘You should watch this video. You should read this book. You should <strong>respond</strong> to this person's communication,'" Gruber said. He added, "That is what a real executive assistant does. And we could have that, but with a really big risk of personal information and privacy."</p>

<p>A United Nations report finds that Myanmar has <strong>overtaken</strong> Afghanistan as the world's top opium producer.</p>
<p>The change came after Myanmar expanded its opium production for a third year, the U.N. reported. In Afghanistan, production fell sharply in 2023 after the Taliban placed a ban on poppy farming.</p>
<p>The latest data on worldwide opium production was recently released in the U.N.'s report, the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2023/Southeast_Asia_Opium_Survey_2023.pdf">Southeast Asia Opium Survey 2023</a>. The report was released by the U.N.'s Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man walks through a flowering opium poppy field in Shan state, Myanmar, 2023.

(UNODC)</span></div>
<p>The report estimates opium crops in Afghanistan dropped an estimated 95 percent in 2023 after the Taliban's ban and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>During the same period, an increasing number of farmers in Myanmar turned to opium as a new crop. The increase in production follows a military takeover of the government in 2021 that pushed the country into a civil war. The situation has severely hurt Myanmar's economy.</p>
<p>The U.N. report estimates poppy growth and processing in Myanmar grew 33 percent in 2022 and another 18 percent this year. That amounts to a total of 47,000 hectares. That is the most land Myanmar has used for opium production since 2013.</p>
<p>Jeremy Douglas is the area representative for the UNODC. He told VOA the country's economic and security situation have severely limited business possibilities and led more people to turn to opium farming to make money.</p>
<p>Most families in Myanmar make their living off the land. But a World Bank report released in May found that nearly half of farming families said they worry about having enough food. That number was up from 26 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The UNODC estimates Myanmar's farmers grew enough poppy this year to produce up to 1,080 metric tons of dry opium. This amounted to total earnings of up to $2.5 billion. Most of this money is believed to have gone to traffickers shipping the product across Asia and as far as Australia, often as heroin.</p>
<p>Most of that heroin flows through neighboring Thailand on its way to other places. In September, Thai police seized over 440 packs of heroin, along with some 15 million methamphetamine pills. A top Thai law enforcement official told VOA the $8.2 million drug seizure was the largest in the country's history.</p>
<p>The UNODC report notes Afghanistan's reduced opium production is expected to create a worldwide heroin shortage and drive prices higher. This is likely to lead even more farmers in Myanmar to start growing poppies.</p>
<p>Douglas said such a shortage could also result in more heroin processed in the Golden Triangle area making its way beyond the Asia-Pacific to Europe and North America. The Golden Triangle is a heavily criminalized area near the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. It is known for growing and producing large amounts of drugs.</p>
<p>Afghan heroin started taking over the European and North American markets from the Golden Triangle more than 10 years ago. That change came as drug controllers in Southeast Asia started dealing mostly in methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Douglas told VOA that even as Afghan production falls sharply, there is still large demand for opium on the world market. He said, "It's highly likely that we're going to start seeing Golden Triangle heroin returning to markets that it hasn't been in for quite some years."</p>

<span class="datetime">19 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Public schools in the United States are increasingly employing online mental health services, or teletherapy, for students.</p>
<p>At least 16 of the 20 largest American public school systems are offering online therapy to reach millions of students, reports the Associated Press. In those systems alone, schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $70 million.</p>
<p>The business model is making so much money that <strong>venture capitalists </strong>are investing in new companies as the market grows. However, some experts have raised concerns about the quality of care offered by fast-growing tech companies.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An employee of Hazel Health displays the opening page of the company's app, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023 (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-fa9b-08dbfb5fa7e5_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An employee of Hazel Health displays the opening page of the company's app, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023 (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)</span></div>
<p>But educators say teletherapy works for many kids and is meeting a large need. Schools are also experiencing shortages in on-site therapists. Online help has made therapy more easily available to children, especially poorer students and those in rural areas. Schools let students connect with online <strong>counselors</strong> during the school day or after hours from home.</p>
<p>Ishoo is a mother of two in Lancaster, California. She struggled to help her second-grade daughter deal with severe <strong>anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>Last spring, her school district started a teletherapy program and Ishoo signed up her daughter. During a month of weekly video sessions at her home, the girl opened up to a therapist. The therapist gave the student tools and techniques to reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>"She learned that it's OK to ask for help, and sometimes everyone needs some extra help," Ishoo said.</p>
<p>The 13,000-student school system, like many others, has counselors and psychologists on staff. But it is not enough to meet the need, said Trish Wilson, the Lancaster <strong>supervisor</strong> of counseling.</p>
<p>Therapists in the area have full caseloads, making it impossible to offer students immediate care, she said. Students rarely have to wait long for an online session.</p>
<p>Students and their parents said in interviews they turned to teletherapy after struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness, stress and anxiety. For many, returning to in-person school after distance learning was very difficult.</p>
<p>Schools are using federal pandemic relief money to pay for help as experts have warned of worrying rates of youth depression, anxiety and suicide. Many school districts are signing contracts with private companies. Others are working with local health care providers, nonprofits or state programs.</p>
<p>Mental health experts welcome the extra support but warn about possible risks. For one, it is getting harder to employ on-site school counselors and psychologists. Competition with telehealth providers is not helping.</p>
<p>"We have 44 counselor <strong>vacancies</strong>, and telehealth definitely <strong>impacts</strong> our ability to fill them," said Doreen Hogans. She is supervisor of school counseling in Prince George's County, Maryland. Hogans estimates 20 percent of school counselors who left have taken teletherapy jobs. The jobs often provide more favorable working hours than the schools.</p>
<p>The quick growth of the companies raises questions about the quality of the therapists, and their experience with children and privacy, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel. He is executive director of Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools improve traditional, in-person mental health services.</p>
<p>One of the biggest providers is San Francisco-based Hazel Health. It started with telemedicine health services in schools in 2016 and expanded to mental health in May 2021, CEO Josh Golomb said. It now employs more than 300 therapists providing teletherapy in over 150 school districts in 15 states.</p>
<p>Other providers are getting into the space. In November, New York City started a free telehealth therapy service for teens to help end barriers to <strong>access</strong>, said Ashwin Vasan, the city's health commissioner. New York is paying the company TalkSpace $26 million over three years for a service permitting teenagers to download an app and connect with therapists.</p>
<p>Unlike other cities, New York is offering the service to all teens, whether attending private, public or home schools, or not in school at all.</p>
<p>"I truly hope this normalizes and democratizes access to mental health care for our young people," Vasan said.</p>

            <title>Pope Approves Blessings for Same-sex Couples  (2023/12/20)</title>

<p>Pope Francis officially approved letting Catholic clergy <strong>bless</strong> same-sex <strong>couples</strong>, the Vatican announced Monday.</p>
<p>The move is a complete change in church policy that aims to make the church more welcoming while continuing its ban on <strong>gay</strong> marriage.</p>
<p>Some have cheered the Vatican statement as a step to break down discrimination in the Catholic Church. But LGBTQ+ supporters say the policy means that the church still considers gay couples as less than heterosexual partners.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pope Francis leads the Angelus prayer from his window, at the Vatican, Dec. 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-fce2-08dbffdc46d7_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Pope Francis leads the Angelus prayer from his window, at the Vatican, Dec. 17, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>The Vatican document expands on a letter that Francis sent to two conservative cardinals last October. In that letter, Francis suggested such blessings could be offered if they were not seen or mistaken as marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>The new document repeats that condition and reaffirms that marriage is a lifelong union between a man and a woman. It stresses that the blessings must not be tied to any Catholic celebration or religious service and should not be performed at the same time as a marriage ceremony. Also, the blessings cannot use ceremonial acts, clothing or movements that belong in a wedding.</p>
<p>But it says requests for such blessings for same-sex couples should not be denied. "For, those seeking a blessing should not be required to have <strong>prior</strong> moral perfection," it said.</p>
<p>The document added, "There is no <strong>intention</strong> to <strong>legitimize</strong> anything, but rather to open one's life to God, to ask for his help to live better..."</p>
<p>The Vatican holds that marriage is a union between man and woman. As a result, it has long opposed same-sex marriage and considers homosexual acts to be "disordered." Nothing in the new document changes that teaching.</p>
<p>In the new document, the church says a blessing is about helping people increase their trust in God. "It is a seed of the Holy Spirit that must be nurtured, not hindered," it said.</p>
<p>It stresses that people in "irregular" unions of extramarital sex — gay or straight — are in a state of sin. But that should not keep them from God's love or <strong>mercy</strong>. "Even when a person's relationship with God is clouded by sin, he can always ask for a blessing, stretching out his hand to God," the document said.</p>
<p>The document is the latest attempt by the Pope to welcome gay Catholics. In 2013, he said, "Who am I to judge?" when asked about a gay clergy. Earlier this year, he told The Associated Press that "being homosexual is not a crime."</p>
<p><strong>Reactions to the announcement</strong></p>
<p>Ramón Gómez oversees human rights for the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation in Chile. He said the statement was a step toward breaking down discrimination in the church and could help LGBTQ+ people in countries where even civil unions are not legal. But he said the document "gives the signal that same-sex couples are <strong>inferior</strong> to heterosexual couples."</p>
<p>The Reverand James Martin supports welcoming LGBTQ+ Catholics. He praised the new document as a "huge step forward" and a change from the Vatican's 2021 policy.</p>
<p>"Along with many Catholic priests, I will now be delighted to bless my friends in same-sex marriages," he said in an email.</p>
<p>In Germany, clergy have been blessing same-sex couples for years. And the head of the German Bishops Conference welcomed the document.</p>
<p>Bishop Georg Baetzing said, "This means that a blessing can be given to couples who do not have the opportunity to marry in church, for example due to divorce, and to same-sex couples."</p>
<p>In the United States, the Reverand John Oesterle, a Catholic priest in Pittsburgh, said many priests would probably not be open to offering such a blessing, but he welcomed Francis' action.</p>
<p>He said, "When I was growing up, the <strong>assumption</strong> was that God made everyone straight. What we have learned is that is not true. In accepting people as God made them, and if Jesus' primary teaching is we should love and serve one another in the community, I think that's what gives Pope Francis the openness to God's presence in those relationships."</p>
<p>Traditionalists, however, expressed shock and anger. Luigi Casalini of Messa in Latino (Latin Mass) blog wrote that the document did not follow the church's teachings. "The church is crumbling," he wrote.</p>
<p>University of Notre Dame theologian Ulrich Lehner was also concerned. Lehner called it: "The most unfortunate public announcement in decades." He said it could lead to division in the church.</p>

            <title>Yemeni Rebel Attacks Affect International Shipping  (2023/12/20) | 也门胡塞武装袭击影响国际航运</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>The recent attacks on ships in and near the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels have affected some of the world's top shipping and oil companies. The threat has moved trade away from an important route for global trade. The change will likely cause delays and increase the prices of goods and energy.<br/>
也门胡塞叛军最近在红海及其附近袭击船只，影响了一些世界顶级航运和石油公司。该威胁使贸易偏离了全球贸易的一条重要航道。这一变化可能会造成延误，并提高商品和能源的价格。</p>
<p>Both oil and European natural gas prices rose a little over market concerns about Houthi attacks. The group, which is supported by Iran, confirmed two new attacks Monday. They were the latest in a series of attacks targeting container ships and oil tankers passing through the narrow waterway that separates Yemen from East Africa. The waterway then leads north to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. It is estimated that 10 percent of the world's trade passes through the canal.<br/>
由于市场对胡塞袭击事件的担忧，石油和欧洲天然气价格都略有上涨。由伊朗支持的该组织星期一证实了两起新的袭击事件。这是针对通过也门与东非之间狭窄水道的集装箱船和油轮的一系列袭击中的最新一起。然后，这条水道向北通向红海和苏伊士运河。据估计，世界贸易的10%通过该航道。</p>
<p>Energy supplies reach Europe and beyond on tankers. And food products like palm oil and grain are carried by container ships through the Suez Canal.<br/>
能源供应通过油轮到达欧洲及其他地区。棕榈油和谷物等食品由集装箱船通过苏伊士运河运输。</p>
<p>"This is a problem for Europe. It's a problem for Asia," said John Stawpert. He is with the International Chamber of Shipping. The industry group represents 80 percent of the world's commercial shipping fleet. Stawpert noted that 40 percent of Asia-Europe trade normally takes the route through the Red Sea.<br/>
“这是欧洲的麻烦，也是亚洲的麻烦，”约翰·斯塔珀特表示。他在国际航运协会工作。该行业机构代表了全球80%的商业航运船队。斯塔珀特指出，40%的亚欧贸易通常通过红海航道。</p>
<p>Almost all goods that stores need for Christmas will have already arrived. But online orders could be delayed, experts said. That is because four of the world's five largest container shipping companies have suspended or rerouted movements from the Red Sea in recent days.<br/>
商店圣诞节所需的几乎所有商品都已到货。但专家表示，网上订单可能会延迟。这是因为最近几天，世界五大集装箱运输公司中的四家已经暂停或改变了从红海的运输路线。</p>
<p>MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM Group, and Hapag-Lloyd are shipping companies that move all consumer goods between Asia and Europe. Almost "all services will have to make this rerouting," said Simon Heaney, who is with Drewry, a shipping research group.<br/>
地中海航运公司、马士基、达飞集团和赫伯罗特是在亚洲和欧洲之间运输所有消费品的航运公司。航运研究组织德鲁里航运咨询公司的西蒙·希尼说，几乎“所有公司都必须重新安排路线”。</p>
<p>Ships will have to go around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead. That will add at least a week of travel time, experts say.<br/>
船只将不得不绕行南非的好望角。专家表示，这将增加至少一周的航行时间。</p>
<p>Depending on what companies decide to do, they could add more ships to make up for the longer trip. They could also travel faster, but that would use more fuel.<br/>
根据公司的决定，他们可以增加更多的船只来弥补更长的行程。它们也可以行驶得更快，但这会消耗更多的燃料。</p>
<p>Stawpert of the Shipping Chamber said he expects some price increases in the short term. But that depends on how long the security threat lasts.<br/>
航运商会的斯塔珀特表示，他预计短期内价格会有所上涨。但这取决于该安全威胁持续的时间。</p>
<p>The Houthi military spokesman said Monday his group launched what he described as "naval aircraft" at the Cayman Islands-flagged ship Swan Atlantic. The boat is a chemical and oil products carrier. The group also attacked the Panama-flagged cargo ship MSC CLARA. He did not offer more details.<br/>
胡塞军方发言人周一表示，胡塞武装向悬挂开曼群岛国旗的“大西洋天鹅”号发射了他所说的“海上无人机”。这艘船是一艘化学品和石油产品运输船。该团伙还袭击了悬挂巴拿马国旗的“地中海航运克拉拉号”货轮。他没有提供更多细节。</p>
<p>Denmark-based ship operator Uni-Tankers said the Swan Atlantic was hit by an unknown object that started a small fire. Crew members put it out and all were reported to be safe, the company said. It received military aid and continued on its way.<br/>
总部位于丹麦的船舶运营商Uni Tankers表示，大西洋天鹅号被一个不明物体击中，引发了一场小火灾。该公司表示，船员将火扑灭，所有人员都安然无恙。它得到了军事援助并继续前进。</p>
<p>U.S., French, British and other warships already patrol the area, keeping the waterway open. Stawpert said countries' naval presence has increased and that should improve confidence in the shipping industry and somewhat ease the threat.<br/>
美国、法国、英国等国军舰已经在该地区巡逻，保持航道畅通。斯塔珀特说，各国海军的存在已经加大，这应该会提高对航运业的信心，并在一定程度上缓解威胁。</p>
<p>Problems in Red Sea shipping could have far-reaching effects because they are happening at the same time ships are being restricted through the Panama Canal. The canal is a major trade route between Asia and the United States.<br/>
红海航运问题可能会产生深远影响，因为这些问题发生的同时，船只正被限制通过巴拿马运河。这条运河是亚洲和美国之间的一条主要贸易路线。</p>
<p>Some companies had planned to reroute to the Red Sea to avoid delays at the Panama Canal caused by a lack of rainfall, experts said.<br/>
专家表示，一些公司曾计划改道前往红海，以避免巴拿马运河因降雨量不足而导致的延误。</p>
<p>With the Houthi attacks, companies taking measures to avoid risk will have to take the longer route around Africa.<br/>
随着胡塞袭击事件的发生，各公司采取措施规避风险将不得不绕非洲走更长的路线。</p>

<span class="datetime">18 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle Report.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its most recent estimate for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>
<p>People with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) suffer from at least six months of severe tiredness that is not helped by rest. They can also report pain and mental <strong>confusion</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Nancy Rose, who contracted COVID-19 in 2021 and exhibits long-haul symptoms including brain fog and memory difficulties, pauses while organizing her desk space, Jan. 25, 2022, in Port Jefferson, New York.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)</span></div>
<p>Health officials said the study was the first nationally representative estimate of how many U.S. adults have chronic fatigue syndrome. The study gathered information from 2021 to 2022. It found that 1.3 percent of American adults reported having CFS or something like it.</p>
<p>These numbers from the CDC are larger than earlier studies have suggested. They likely include people with long COVID, a condition of long-lasting sickness after a COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>The findings led CDC's Dr. Elizabeth Unger to say that CFS "is not a rare illness." She was one of the writers of the report.</p>
<p>The tiredness and other symptoms of CFS can get worse after exercise, work, or other activity. There is no cure, and no testing leads to a quick <strong>diagnosis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>No known cause</strong></p>
<p>Doctors do not know the cause. However, research suggests it is the body's overreaction to an infection or other shock to the immune system.</p>
<p>The condition gained attention nearly 40 years ago, when many cases were reported in Incline Village, Nevada, and Lyndonville, New York. Some doctors dismissed it, calling it psychosomatic. Psychosomatic means a problem is mental or emotional rather than physical.</p>
<p>Some doctors also called it "yuppie flu." "Yuppie" stands for "young, urban professional," people who have good jobs and medical coverage.</p>
<p>Some doctors still think CFS is a mental condition, experts and patients say.</p>
<p>Doctors "called me a <strong>hypochondriac</strong> and said it was just <strong>anxiety</strong> and depression," said Hannah Powell. She is a 26-year-old woman from Utah who was diagnosed after five years.</p>
<p><strong>New findings from the report</strong></p>
<p>The new CDC report is based on a <strong>survey</strong> of more than 57,000 U.S. adults. They were asked if a doctor or other health-care professional had ever told them they had myalgic encephalomyelitis, or CFS, and whether they still have it. About 1.3 percent said yes to both questions.</p>
<p>CDC officials said that results in an estimate of 3.3 million U.S. adults.</p>
<p>The study also reported other findings. It said that CFS was more common in women than men. White people reported the condition more than other racial and ethnic groups. Earlier, smaller studies reported similar findings.</p>
<p>The findings showed there was less of a difference between women and men than some earlier studies suggested. And there was little difference between Black and white people.</p>
<p>However, the study also found that a higher percentage of poor people reported the condition than wealthy people.</p>
<p><strong>CFS is not a popular diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Brayden Yellman is a specialist at the Bateman Horne Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He said patients who report the condition usually have health care coverage. He said doctors might believe them more when they say they "continue to be <strong>fatigued </strong>and can't go to work."</p>
<p>The CDC study is based on patients' memories. It did not use medical records. That could lead to overcounting. However, it is possible that only a percentage of people with CFS are diagnosed, said Dr. Daniel Clauw. He is director of the University of Michigan's Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center.</p>
<p>He added that is not a "popular diagnosis to give because there (are) no drugs approved for it. There (are) no treatment guidelines for it."</p>
<p>The total number likely includes some patients with long COVID who were suffering from long-term tiredness, CDC officials said.</p>
<p>"We think it's the same illness," Yellman said. But long COVID is more widely accepted by doctors and is being diagnosed much more quickly, he said.</p>
<p>Powell, one of Yellman's patients, was a high school athlete who came down with an illness during a trip to Belize before her final year. Doctors thought she had malaria, and she seemed to recover. But she developed chronic tiredness, had trouble sleeping, and had frequent <strong>vomiting</strong>. She said she slowly stopped playing sports and had trouble doing schoolwork.</p>
<p>After five years, a doctor said she had chronic fatigue. She began to regain normal life through regular treatments of fluids and medications. She graduated from the University of Utah and now works for an organization that helps domestic violence victims.</p>
<p>Getting care is still a struggle, she said.</p>
<p>"When I go to the (emergency room) or to another doctor's visit, instead of saying I have chronic fatigue syndrome, I usually say I have long COVID," Powell said. "And I am believed almost immediately."</p>

            <title>The Story of Santa Claus  (2023/12/19)</title>

<p>Santa Claus is someone who will remain in the hearts of children forever. He is the make-believe person who brings toys and other gifts to children at Christmas. To grown-ups, he is a special symbol of good will and selfless giving.<br/>
<br/>
Santa Claus also has some other names, like Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle and Pelznickel.</p>
<p>The Santa Claus we talk about in the United States flies from his home at the North Pole on Christmas Eve to bring toys and gifts to children. The happy, white-bearded man is dressed in red. He usually flies on a <strong>sleigh</strong> led by his reindeer. Santa enters each home through the <strong>chimney</strong> and fills children's stockings with toys and gifts.</p>
<p>This modern image of Santa Claus largely comes from Clement Clark Moore's famous poem, <em>A Visit from St. Nicholas.</em></p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man dressed as Santa Claus waves during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 23, 2023. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/85ad8313-4d64-40d1-a70d-404bc29466ed_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">A man dressed as Santa Claus waves during the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 23, 2023. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)</span></div>
<p><em>‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br/>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br/>
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;...</em></p>
<p><em>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br/>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br/>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;</em></p>
<p>Santa Claus is believed to have come from the story of St. Nicholas. He was a 4th-century clergy in the Mediterranean port city of Myra, part of modern-day Turkey. It is said that St. Nicholas gave away all his wealth to help the poor and the sick. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.history.com/topics/christmas/santa-claus#santa-claus-around-the-world">History.com</a><em> </em>says St. Nicholas became known as the protector of children and sailors. It adds that he was the most popular saint in Europe.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, Dutch immigrants brought the story of Saint Nikolaas and the tradition of gift-giving to New York City. The Dutch said his name very quickly. It sounded like "Sinterklaas." When English speakers said this word, it sounded like Santa Claus.</p>
<p>German immigrants working as farmers in the American state of Pennsylvania also knew of Saint Nikolaas. But they called him Pelznickel. This word came from "pelz," meaning fur in German, and "nickel" for Nicholas. Saint Nikolaasor became a man dressed in fur who came once a year with gifts for good children.</p>
<p>Pelznickel became part of a celebration honoring the Christkindl, as the Germans called the child of Christ. After some time, Christkindl became "Kris Kringle." That is another name you will hear for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>A Santa-liked <strong>figure</strong> is known as Father Christmas in Britain and Père Noel in France. In Scandinavia, an elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. In Italy, a woman called La Befana rides a broomstick down the chimneys of homes to bring toys for lucky children.</p>
<p>The image of Santa Claus as we now see him came from Thomas Nast. He was an American painter born in Bavaria, Germany.</p>
<p>Nast remembered that, when he was a little boy, a kind old man would give toys and cakes to the children on Christmas. So, when Nast painted Santa Claus, he looked like the old man from his childhood.</p>
<p>Nast painted Santa as a short, fat, <strong>jolly</strong> old man with a long beard. He wore a red suit with white fur. He also gave Santa a North Pole workshop, elves, and a wife, Mrs. Claus. Through the years, Nast's painting has remained the most popular picture of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>American children write letters to Santa hoping to be on his "nice list" for Christmas gifts. On Christmas Eve, they leave cookies and milk for Santa and carrots for his reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen and "the most famous reindeer of all," Rudolph.</p>

<p>In Ukraine, a man who goes by his military name Karabas is training to fight against the Russian army. But Karabas is not from Ukraine. He is from Russia.</p>
<p>Karabas was living in Moscow when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He was shocked and very upset, and he decided to act.</p>
<p>He decided to find a way to get to Ukraine. There, he hoped to join troops fighting Russian forces.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Members of the pro-Ukrainian Russian ethnic Siberian Battalion practice at a military training close to Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023.

<p>It took him almost a year to make it happen.</p>
<p>Today, he is part of the Siberian Battalion, a group of Russians who have joined the Ukrainian military to fight against their own country. Its members come mostly from ethnic minorities from Russia's far east.</p>
<p>They hope to someday help remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power.</p>
<p>Karabas told The Associated Press that he was <strong>disappointed</strong> in the Russian people. He said he was upset that people were supporting Putin without thinking. And he was upset that they did not seem to care about the war.</p>
<p>"That is why I wanted to come here...and fight for a free Ukraine," he added.</p>
<p>Unlike other volunteer units in Ukraine with Russian nationals, the Siberian Battalion is officially part of the Ukrainian army. To enter the unit, fighters must pass strict security checks. This process can take up to a year.</p>
<p>Karabas went to Armenia first. There, he met Ukrainians and learned to speak the Ukrainian language. Now, he refuses to speak Russian.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian army is training the Siberian Battalion and sending them to the front lines in eastern Ukraine. That area has seen some of the deadliest fighting of the war. Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to fight for control of it.</p>
<p>Fighters in the battalion from eastern Siberia hope a Ukrainian victory will weaken or change Russia's control over their <strong>region</strong>. The area is among the poorest in Russia. People from the area's Yakut and Buryat ethnic communities complain of racism and unfair use of power against them in Russia. This has made some activists call for independence.</p>
<p>Another Russian fighter, who goes by the name Holod, openly said he wants Putin's administration removed from power.</p>
<p>"When this happens, we can talk about victory," he said.</p>
<p>Karabas and other Russians left their entire lives behind, including families and friends.</p>
<p>Some from the battalion have already been sent near Avdiivka, a Ukraine-controlled city in the Donetsk region. The Russian military has been fighting to take control of the area.</p>
<p>The battalion was created six months ago. It has fewer than 100 members, but Ukrainian military leaders hope more will join. Based on <strong>applications</strong> they have received, they are aiming to have up to 300 members in the unit.</p>
<p>Karabas said there may be tens or hundreds of thousands of other Russians like him, willing to fight with Ukraine.</p>
<p>"I think we should have a lot more (Russian fighters)," he said.</p>

<p>American researchers have combined lab-grown human brain tissue with computer hardware to create a working biocomputer.</p>
<p>The scientists say brain cells used in the experiment were able to recognize speech and complete simple math problems.</p>
<p>The team made brain-like tissue that took the form of what they called a "brain organoid." Harvard University's Stem Cell Institute <a class="wsw__a" href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/organoids">explains</a> that an organoid is a collection of individualized, complex cells that can be grown from stem cells in a lab.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this July 29, 2013 photo, a researcher holds a human brain in a laboratory at Northwestern University's cognitive neurology and Alzheimer's disease center in Chicago.

<p>Under the right laboratory conditions, organoids can be made to look and even work similarly to real human tissue and organs. In this process, stem cells "can follow their own genetic <strong>instructions</strong> to self-organize," the Stem Cell Institute says.</p>
<p>So far, scientists have been able to produce organoids that look like, or resemble, some organs. These organs include the brain, kidney, lung, stomach and liver. Such lab-created organoids are generally used to study how organs work without needing to experiment on actual organs.</p>
<p>In the biocomputer experiment, the team said stem cells were able to form neurons similar to those found in the human brain. Neurons are electrically charged cells that transport signals to the brain and other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Feng Guo led the experiment. He is a bioengineer and professor of Intelligent System Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. His team recently published their research results <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01069-w.epdf?sharing_token=NYPf_32wRs_t6U-N_UVaLtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M8M4oYFZwXw3ADmbAHb74edPY2vKOF1O-GEmUziwBdM4S_Qm6LsNScxuBszwcCh3Rk4pthEc9aDrLpsaqe7-4YKhK3HWl1E_kodyNXdLfYE8tDAEEOwYPeyB57nYaTS37RGi7ufFW6oTEw56CoODMlO5EDr-JQRXB5mXPmLNcJ7z0bta70aD4yJ4RBCmGphCY%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.technologyreview.com">in a study</a> in <em>Nature Electronics</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers attached the brain organoid to a set of traditional electronic computing <strong>circuits</strong>. The researchers call this system Brainoware. The system was used to establish communication between the organoid and electronic circuits. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool was used to help read the neural activity of the organoid.</p>
<p>The scientists aim to build "a bridge between AI and organoids," Guo <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03975-7">explained</a> to <em>Nature</em>. Guo believes that combining organoids and computer circuits could provide additional speed and energy to improve the performance of AI computing systems.</p>
<p>The study notes that adding human brain power might be able to help machines with the things they do not do as well as people. For example, the researchers said humans generally have a faster learning ability and use less energy thinking than computers do.</p>
<p>During one part of the experiment, the team tested the Brainoware system's voice recognition ability. The team trained the system on 240 recordings of eight different voices. The researchers said the organoid produced different neural signals in reaction to the different voices. The <strong>accuracy</strong> level of the system reached 78 percent, Guo said.</p>
<p>"This is the first demonstration of using brain organoids [for computing]," Guo <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/11/1084926/human-brain-cells-chip-organoid-speech-recognition/">told</a> <em>MIT Technology Review</em>. He added, "It's exciting to see the possibilities of organoids for biocomputing in the future."</p>
<p>Guo said these results persuaded his team that a brain-computer system can work to improve computing performance, especially for some AI jobs. But he noted the best accuracy rates recorded by the Brainoware system were still below the accuracy rates of traditional AI networks. Guo said this is one of the things his team plans to try to improve.</p>
<p>Lena Smirnova is a developmental neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She told <em>Nature</em> that more research will be needed to improve such systems. But she said, "The study confirms some key <strong>theoretical</strong> ideas that could eventually make a biological computer possible."</p>
<p>Smirnova noted that in earlier experiments, researchers have used other kinds of neuron cells to perform similar computational activities. But the latest study, she said, was the first to demonstrate this kind of performance in a brain organoid.</p>

<p>United Nations delegates from nearly 200 countries recently held a climate meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The delegates agreed that the world must move away from fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.</p>
<p>The U.N. meeting on climate change is called COP28 this year. Recently, <em>The Associated Press</em> gave details about some of the main results of notable climate talks over almost 30 years:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Activists demonstrate for climate justice and a ceasefire at the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Dec. 9, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/55a437db-880e-45ed-8ff6-4b4ba8c5a31e_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Activists demonstrate for climate justice and a ceasefire at the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Dec. 9, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>The Kyoto Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was the third high-level U.N. climate meeting. It took place in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.</p>
<p>The agreement asked 41 countries that produced a lot of carbon gases to cut their <strong>emissions</strong> by about five percent compared to their emission levels in 1990.</p>
<p>Countries agreed to some of the terms in the Kyoto Protocol by 2005. The United States and China, however, did not approve the agreement. Those countries have the world's two largest economies and produce the largest amount of carbon gases.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was not successful by some measures. Emissions have greatly increased since then. But it is the first time so many U.N. members agreed that carbon gases were a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Copenhagen's money for the climate</strong></p>
<p>The 2009 climate meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark is widely seen as a failure. Developing and developed countries disagreed on cutting emissions and whether poor nations could use oil, natural gas, and coal to grow their economies.</p>
<p>However, wealthy countries promised to send $100 billion a year to developing countries. The money was to be used for green technology by 2020. Green technology often describes energy technology that does not produce pollution when it is used.</p>
<p>But wealthy nations did not reach their goal of $100 billion by the start of the 2020s. That led to criticism from developing countries and environmentalists.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group, said wealthy countries probably reached their $100-billion goal.</p>
<p>But the British nonprofit group Oxfam said 70 percent of the money was in the form of loans. It said the loans increased debt problems in developing countries.</p>
<p>Also, an increasing number of weather-related disasters are blamed on climate change. Experts say the money promised is not enough. British economist Nicholas Stern said that developing countries likely need $2 trillion every year by 2030 for climate projects and recovery.</p>
<p><strong>The Paris agreement</strong></p>
<p>The Paris Agreement is widely considered the single biggest U.N. agreement on climate change. In 2015, about 196 nations agreed to keep atmospheric warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius since, what the agreement calls, "pre-industrial times." Later, the goal became limiting warming no higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>The U.N. says the Paris agreement is a "legally binding international treaty," meaning that it has the force of law in countries that approve it. But there do not appear to be punishments for countries that do not follow its rules.</p>
<p>Today, the goal of limiting the rise of the atmosphere's temperature to 1.5 degrees is still central to climate discussions. U.N. experts say the world's temperature has not passed the limit set in the Paris agreement. The U.N. says it has warmed from 1.1 to 1.2 degrees Celsius since the early 1800s. But it says the atmosphere will reach the 1.5-degree limit soon unless large cuts in emissions are made quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Glasgow and coal</strong></p>
<p>Six years after the Paris agreement, climate officials wanted another agreement to strengthen the levels agreed upon in 2015.</p>
<p>The meeting in Glasgow, Scotland was put off until 2021. It was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting included protests led by teenaged climate activist Greta Thunberg. She helped lead a worldwide movement of youth activists demanding more action from leaders.</p>
<p>In Glasgow, countries agreed to "<strong>phase</strong>-down" coal use. That is different from saying "phase-out." India and China, two of the world's biggest coal users, pressed for the change.</p>
<p>So far, most countries have failed to meet the promises they made at the Glasgow deal. Emissions from coal have increased and most major coal-using countries have yet to slow use of the fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Loss and damage in Sharm el-Sheikh</strong></p>
<p>Last year, climate talks took place in the Egyptian vacation town of Sharm el-Sheikh. There, countries agreed to create a <strong>fund</strong> for poor nations for the first time.</p>
<p>Delegates agreed to a loss and damage fund. Its aim was to provide money to countries that suffered damage from severe weather events.</p>
<p>Delegates at the COP27 meeting called for the fund to be created after a flood in Pakistan killed an estimated 2,000 people and caused billions of dollars in losses.</p>
<p>The fund was officially created on the first day of this year's talks in Dubai. Over $700 million has been promised. Giving to the fund is voluntary.</p>
<p>U.N. climate experts say billions of dollars are needed because of weather-related events like cyclones, rising sea levels, floods and droughts. The experts blame the extreme events on increasing temperatures in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>An early version of Mickey Mouse, the famous Disney character, will soon belong to you, me and everybody else.<br/>
迪士尼著名角色米老鼠的早期版本很快就会属于大众。</p>
<p>The mouse that started a Hollywood empire, along with several other characters, movies, and books will enter the public domain on January 1st.<br/>
这只开创了好莱坞帝国的老鼠，以及其他几个角色、电影和书籍将于1月1日进入公有领域。</p>
<p>Public domain is the term to describe creative works that are no longer protected by U.S. copyright law. Once a work enters the public domain, it can legally be shared, performed, reused, or repurposed without permission or cost.<br/>
公有领域是一个专业术语，用于描述不再受美国版权法保护的创意作品。一旦作品进入公有领域，就可以合法地共享、表演、重利用或重新调整用途，而无需获得许可或支付费用。</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, and Minnie Mouse, first appeared publicly in the 1928 film Steamboat Willie. Copyright law at the time provided protection for 75 years. But in 1998, U.S. law extended copyright protection for another 20 years.<br/>
米老鼠和米妮老鼠首次公开出现在1928年的电影《汽船威利》中。当时的版权法提供了75年的保护。但在1998年，美国法律将版权保护期又延长了20年。</p>
<p>Jennifer Jenkins is head of Duke University's Center for the Study of Public Domain. Jenkins says copyright law is sometimes called the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. As the character is about to enter the public domain, she says "This is it. This is Mickey Mouse. This is exciting because it's kind of symbolic."<br/>
詹妮弗·詹金斯是杜克大学公有领域研究中心的负责人。詹金斯说，版权法有时被称为《米老鼠保护法》。随着这个角色即将进入公有领域，她说：“就是这样。这是米老鼠。这很令人兴奋，因为它有点象征意义。”</p>
<p>In a statement, the Disney Company told The Associated Press, "Ever since Mickey Mouse's first appearance in the 1928 short film Steamboat Willie, people have associated the character with Disney's stories, experiences, and authentic products." The company added, "More modern versions of Mickey will remain unaffected by the expiration of the Steamboat Willie copyright..."<br/>
迪士尼公司在一份声明中告诉美联社，“自从米老鼠第一次出现在1928年的短片《汽船威利》中以来，人们已经把这个角色与迪士尼的故事、经历和正牌产品联系在一起。”该公司补充道，“现代版本的米奇将不受《汽船威利》版权到期的影响……”</p>
<p>People will only be able to use the version of the mouse in Steamboat Willie that has become public. However, observers expect the courts to be busy in the coming years judging what is inside and outside Disney's ownership.<br/>
人们将只能使用已经开放版权的《汽船威利》中使用米老鼠版本。然而观察人士预计，未来几年，法院将忙于判断属于和不属于迪士尼所有权的情况。</p>
<p>Disney also holds a trademark on Mickey to represent the company and its brand. That law bars the use of the character as a Disney product identifier for anyone except Disney.<br/>
迪士尼还持有米奇的商标，以代表公司及其品牌。该法律禁止除迪士尼以外的任何人使用该角色作为迪士尼产品的标识符。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Others in the public domain<br/>
公有领域的其他</span></p>
<p>Another famous animal character, Tigger, will also join his friend Winnie the Pooh in the public domain. The bouncing tiger first appeared in the book The House at Pooh Corner by British writer A.A. Milne. It turns 96 in January.<br/>
另一个著名的动物角色跳跳虎，也将加入他的朋友小熊维尼的行列进入公有领域。这只蹦蹦跳跳的老虎首次出现在英国作家A.A.米尔恩的《维尼角的小屋》一书中。今年一月份它就满96岁了。</p>
<p>The silly old bear Pooh, himself, became public property two years ago when Milne's book Winnie the Pooh came of age. The soft-spoken bear, no longer protected by copyright, is seen terrorizing women in this year's horror film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.<br/>
两年前，当米尔恩的书《小熊维尼》到了法定年头时，这只傻里傻气的老熊维尼就成了公共财产。这只说话轻声细语的熊不再受版权保护，在今年的恐怖电影《小熊维尼：血与蜜》中，可以看到它吓唬女性。</p>
<p>Other creative works entering the U.S. public domain are Charlie Chaplin's film Circus, Virginia Woolf's book Orlando, and Eugene O'Neill's play Long Day's Journey into Night.<br/>
其他进入美国公有领域的创意作品包括查理·卓别林的电影《马戏团》、弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫的书《奥兰多》和尤金·奥尼尔的戏剧《漫漫长夜》。</p>

<span class="datetime">17 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Children in the Indonesian city of Bogor are cleaning up a local lake on their own.</p>
<p>The young people take small boats, called kayaks, out on the water. They direct the kayaks toward floating trash. They remove the trash from the water and place it in their boats. Later, on land, all the trash is examined and dealt with.</p>
<p>About 20 children take part in the effort to fight pollution but it began with one boy. Ten years ago, Giri Marhara decided to start cleaning up the lake. He was just 16 years old at the time and had a <strong>habit</strong> of cleaning up his environment.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Environmental activist members of the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior pick up trash while paddling kayaks at Setu Gede lake in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-1582-08dbfcc51fee_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Environmental activist members of the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior pick up trash while paddling kayaks at Setu Gede lake in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)</span></div>
<p>Young people like Marhara have been at the front of environmental and climate change movements in recent years. Movements like school strikes for climate action, protests at United Nations climate talks, and local clean ups have often been youth-led.</p>
<p>The <strong>small-scale</strong> campaigns in Indonesia have been popular with younger people, gaining support and attention.</p>
<p>"For me, cleaning up is <strong>catharsis</strong>, cleaning up is <strong>refreshing</strong>," said Marhara. He said children playing nearby would often ask if they could help him with lake clean up.</p>
<p>They formed a group last year, called the Situ Gede Cleanliness Warrior, named after the lake. They boat across the lake, pick up trash, and identify what can be recycled.</p>
<p>Marhara and his friends have collected more than 2,700 kilograms of trash in and around the Situ Gede lake.</p>
<p>The trash problem in Indonesia is widespread. Its Environmental and Forestry Ministry says the country produced more than 35 million tons of waste last year. It estimates that 35 percent of waste in the country is <strong>unmanaged</strong>. Garbage along roadways, waterways and natural environments is a common sight.</p>
<p>Waste is also responsible for around 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, says the World Resources Institute. Much of that comes from food waste. If left to <strong>decompose</strong> in landfills, food waste can release methane. The gas warms the planet and is around 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The trash problem has raised health concerns: Plastic waste, for example, gets broken down into tiny pieces called microplastics, which can enter the human body. Studies suggest it can damage the <strong>endocrine</strong>, nervous and immune systems, and can carry an increased risk of cancers.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to landfill or littering for some waste products: food waste can be <strong>composted</strong>, for example. Some other types of waste, like certain types of plastic, can be reused or recycled. But environmentalists also say the world needs to make less waste in the first place, as much of it ends up in landfills or in the world's oceans.</p>
<p>But as waste continues, youth-led clean ups can still make an impact, even if it is just for small areas or communities.</p>
<p>Marhara believes that lasting change will require ending "behavior that is causing trash to be out there in the environment," he said, saying the country has a "<strong>littering</strong> culture."</p>
<p>"I think that the only way to counter that culture is by developing a <strong>counterculture</strong>," a clean up culture, he said.</p>

<p>The presidents of three well-known American universities recently spoke to members of the U.S. Congress about antisemitism on college <strong>campuses</strong>.</p>
<p>Antisemitism is the word used to describe a hatred of Jewish people.</p>
<p>The House's Committee on Education called Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a five-hour hearing in Washington, D.C.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill testifies before a House Education and The Workforce Committee hearing titled Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 5, 2023.

(REUTERS/Ken Cedeno)</span></div>
<p>The Republican-led committee chose the three leaders because their schools "have been at the center of the rise in antisemitic protests," a committee spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The protests are related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. On October 7, Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack in Israel and killed over 1,200 Jewish people. Since then, the conflict has led to the deaths of more than 18,000 people in the Palestinian territory of Gaza.</p>
<p>Protesters who supported Palestine used the word "intifada," an Arabic word for resistance, and the phrase "from the river to the sea." Some people believe the phrase is a call for the death of all Jews.</p>
<p><strong>"Yes or no?"</strong></p>
<p>Representative Elise Stefanik is a Republican lawmaker from New York state. Stefanik, who went to Harvard, asked each university leader about how their school would react to calls to kill a large number of Jews, something described as <strong>genocide</strong>.</p>
<p>Stefanik asked Magill: "Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or <strong>code of conduct</strong>? Yes or no?"</p>
<p>Magill did not answer "yes" or "no." Instead, she said the university only considers if "speech turns into conduct." By that, she meant the university respects an individual's right to free speech. But if the speech became "directed and severe, <strong>pervasive,</strong>" as the president said, it would then be considered more serious. In response to a question about whether a student would be punished for their speech, Magill said it depended on "<strong>context</strong>."</p>
<p>When faced with the same questions from Stefanik, Gay of Harvard and Kornbluth of MIT also did not say "yes" or "no."</p>
<p>Gay answered that it depended on the context. She added that when "speech crosses into conduct, that violates our policies." And Kornbluth answered that she had not "heard calling for the genocide of Jews on our campus."</p>
<p><strong>Criticism and questions of free speech</strong></p>
<p>The answers brought serious criticism from national and state political leaders, students, and members of the college community.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said Magill's answer was "unacceptable." He said talk of genocide against any group of people "is all in the wrong... She needed to give a one-word answer."</p>
<p>A spokesman for President Joe Biden criticized the three college presidents' answers. In a statement, he said they did not go far enough to condemn antisemitism on campuses. And calls for genocide go against "everything we represent as a country."</p>
<p>All three university presidents later apologized for not speaking out against Jewish genocide. Magill called for a review of Penn's policies which she said have long been guided by the U.S. Constitution. Gay wrote that "calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are <strong>vile</strong>, they have no place at Harvard."</p>
<p>Free speech experts say the college presidents' answers at the hearing did follow the current understanding of the Constitution's right to free speech.</p>
<p>Suzanne Nossell is the leader of the nonprofit PEN America, a free-expression organization. She said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects "even deeply hateful speech."</p>
<p><strong>The outcome</strong></p>
<p>The congressional hearing took place on December 5.</p>
<p>By December 9, Magill resigned under pressure from wealthy donors and <strong>alumni</strong>. The pressure had started earlier this autumn when the university permitted a meeting on campus despite charges that some speakers had shown antisemitic views in other comments.</p>
<p>At MIT, the school's leadership group, called the MIT Corporation, announced its support for Kornbluth, who is Jewish, two days after the hearing. It said in a statement, "She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate ..."</p>
<p>Gay faced pressure from Harvard's donors and alumni to step down. But more than 600 Harvard professors voiced their support for her leadership. They say that the school should not be influenced by political pressure.</p>
<p>Laurence Tribe is a well-known law professor at Harvard. He was critical of Gay's answer at the hearing. But he supported her continued leadership. Tribe said that "it is dangerous for universities to be... <strong>bullied</strong> into <strong>micromanaging</strong> their policies."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Harvard leadership group announced that it would stand behind Gay and she would continue as the university's president.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>If you live in a part of the world that is experiencing winter right now, it might be snowing.</p>
<p>But even if you do not live in a snowy <strong>climate</strong>, try to image cold, snowy weather. Imagine having a snowball fight with your friends. A snowball is, of course, a ball of snow. But not all snow makes good snowballs. If the snow is too light and dry, it will not hold together. It is <strong>powdery</strong>. Wetter snow makes for great snowballs. You can pack it into a tight ball, which is great for throwing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Snowballs fly during a snowball fight organized by the DC Snowball Fight Association, on the National Mall in the snow, Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/E81E4789-5EA7-4E37-9AAE-5573AD054F7B_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Snowballs fly during a snowball fight organized by the DC Snowball Fight Association, on the National Mall in the snow, Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)</span></div>
<p>A snowball might hurt a bit, but it would not cause a lot of damage. But imagine that snowball rolling down a hill. As it rolls, it picks up more and more snow. It gets bigger and bigger until it crashes into something and causes damage!</p>
<p>And that gives us "snowball" as a verb.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com defines the verb "snowball" as becoming "larger, greater, more <strong>intense</strong>..." very quickly.</p>
<p>If something like a project, campaign, or business snowballs, its progress rapidly increases and grows. For example, after a photographer posted a picture on Instagram of a m<i><i>onkey</i></i> protecting a human baby, her followers snowballed to over 1 million within a week!</p>
<p>However, when we use this expression the ending results are usually not good. Something that snowballs in a bad way <u>goes downhill</u> quickly. For example, when we do not take care of small problems, they can snowball into bigger ones.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear an example using the verb "snowball."</p>
<p><em>A: I have a friend who lied about knowing sign language on her <strong>r</strong></em><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>sum</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><em>. She thought no one would ask her to actually prove she knew sign language. But her boss asked her to. In fact, he set up a big meeting with the deaf community and assigned her to act as <strong>translator</strong>. She lied about why she could not attend the event. But her boss surprised her with an unplanned meeting. That is when he found out that she did not know how to sign. Her lie on her r</em><em>e</em><em>sum</em><em>e</em><em> quickly snowballed into a workplace drama that got her fired from her job. </em></p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the expression <u>snowball effect</u>.</p>
<p>A <u>snowball effect</u> is a situation where one action or event causes many other similar actions or events. And these actions or events grow and grow bigger and more problematic – just like a snowball rolling down a hill.</p>
<p>A snowball effect is similar to a <u>chain of events</u>. However, with a chain of events, one thing leads to another. But these events do not necessarily intensify or grow bigger.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Hopefully, using resources on VOA Learning English is having a snowball effect on your English studies ... in a good way!</p>

<p>
VOA Learning English presents America's Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about William Jefferson Clinton – better known as Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton took office in 1993, and was re-elected in 1996. In many ways, historians consider his time in office a success. The economy expanded, and the country was largely at peace.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Presidents - Bill Clinton" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/7493e0cb-7da8-4433-85f3-39609c1945f0_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Presidents - Bill Clinton</span></div>
<p>But Clinton had some notable failures, too. He could not persuade Congress to accept a plan to reform the nation's health care system.</p>
<p>And, in his second term, the House of Representatives took steps to remove him from office. But the Senate decided not to act.</p>
<p>Clinton finished his second term with high approval ratings. Yet he is also remembered for being only the second U.S. president to be <strong>impeached</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Early life</strong></p>
<p>Bill Clinton came from a town with a memorable name: Hope. He grew up there, and in another nearby town in the Southern state of Arkansas.</p>
<p>For most of his early life, Bill was raised by his grandmother and his mother, both nurses. His father had died in a car accident before he was born.</p>
<p>People who knew Bill as a young man remember him as very intelligent, charming with people, and talented in music. His mother told him he would be president one day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Clinton pursued activities that would lead to a political career. He attended college at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, where he studied international affairs; led student government groups; and took a position as a <strong>clerk</strong> in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>He went on to study at Oxford University in England on a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.</p>
<p>Then he graduated from law school at Yale University. There, he met another student who would be his wife, Hillary Rodham. The two went on to have one child together, a daughter named Chelsea.</p>
<p>After finishing his studies, Clinton returned to his home state of Arkansas and pursued political office. At 32, he became one of the youngest governors ever in the country.</p>
<p>Two years later, he was voted out of office, and -- as historian Russell Riley notes -- he became the youngest <em>former</em> governor.</p>
<p>And that is how a good deal of Clinton's political career continued: in a pattern of successes and failures.</p>
<p>His successes often came as a result of his <strong>centrist</strong> policies, which appealed to people of different political beliefs. He also was an effective public speaker and, to many, a likable, charismatic person who seemed to care deeply about others.</p>
<p>But, his critics pointed out, Clinton also appeared to make many decisions simply for political advantage. And he sometimes tried to please so many people that he pleased no one.</p>
<p>Following a series of increasingly national roles – as well as a series of setbacks – Clinton campaigned for president in 1992. At first, he did not do well in the campaign. He was young and not well-known. He also suffered from reports that he had relationships with women who were not his wife.</p>
<p>But in time, Clinton began winning primary contests. Reporters called him the "Comeback Kid." He earned a public image as a politician who could survive problems.</p>
<p>In the general election, Clinton competed against the sitting president, Republican George H.W. Bush. The two men also faced an unusually strong third-party candidate named Ross Perot.</p>
<p>On Election Night, Clinton prevailed. Because Americans had split their votes among three major candidates, Clinton earned less than 50% of the popular vote. But he won enough electoral votes to become the next U.S. president.</p>
<p><strong>Presidency</strong></p>
<p>The people who worked on Bill Clinton's presidential campaign adopted an informal motto. They said, "It's the economy, stupid." In other words, campaign officials believed that most Americans cared primarily about how a president's policies would affect their financial concerns.</p>
<p>So, President Clinton quickly set about making a series of economic changes. They included raising taxes on wealthier Americans and cutting spending to help poorer Americans.</p>
<p>In a few years, the U.S. budget deficit was gone, the federal government had a surplus, and the country's financial situation was strong and healthy – although not everyone approved of the steps Clinton took to get there, or believed he should get all the credit.</p>
<p>Early in his first term, Clinton sought an additional reform he believed would help voters' financial concerns: affordable health insurance for all Americans. Most people in the U.S. either bought private health insurance or did not have any insurance to help pay for medical costs. Clinton wanted to find a way for the U.S. government to support Americans' health-related expenses.</p>
<p>He appointed his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton, to lead a healthcare reform effort. Hillary Clinton, a lawyer, had led a similar effort to reform education in Arkansas when her husband was governor there.</p>
<p>But some lawmakers in Congress – as well as some voters – rejected her efforts. The reform effort failed.</p>
<p>Clinton also struggled in some early foreign policy moves. He withdrew American troops from Somalia after their humanitarian efforts there turned into a bloody military struggle.</p>
<p>He was also criticized for failing to intervene quickly in the genocide in Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of people were killed.</p>
<p>Later, Clinton won praise for some of his foreign policy. His government helped restore the elected president in Haiti after a coup. It also helped negotiate peace agreements in Bosnia and Ireland. And it cooperated with NATO to intervene in the Kosovo area and stop attacks on Albanians there.</p>
<p>In general, Clinton believed the U.S. had an important role to play in maintaining peace and protecting human life around the world. At the same time, he did not want to use too many American resources to do so. He aimed to cooperate with other nations, and to set moderate goals.</p>
<p>As usual, Clinton adopted an approach that was not too extreme on one side or another.</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment</strong></p>
<p>During most of his time as president, Clinton had been under investigation. Federal judges had appointed a special counsel, named Kenneth Starr, to find out if the president had committed any crimes related to financial investments before he took office.</p>
<p>During the investigation, Starr learned that the president had been having a sexual relationship with a young woman who worked in the White House. Starr asked Clinton about the affair under oath.</p>
<p>Later, Starr accused Clinton of lying about his relationship with the woman. Starr said that Clinton had also tried to prevent others from telling the truth about some of his activities.</p>
<p>In time, the president publicly admitted the relationship, and he apologized to voters and his family. But he said he had not lied or told anyone else to lie for him.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the House of Representatives did not accept Clinton's defense. They advanced two articles of impeachment.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate then considered the case. It is their job to examine the evidence and decide whether to remove a president from office. A majority did not believe the actions Clinton was accused of were serious violations against the country. They voted to acquit Clinton of the charges and permit him to continue as president.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>In the U.S., a president can serve only two full terms. After his second, Bill Clinton and his wife settled in a town outside New York City. In time, Hillary Clinton became the U.S. senator from New York, as well as a secretary of state and the Democratic Party's candidate for president.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, like many other U.S. presidents, wrote about his experiences and helped develop his presidential library. He also worked on humanitarian, health, and economic issues with his family's organization, the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>For many, Clinton's time in office is remembered as a mixed experience. The economy was at one of its strongest in U.S. history. Most people could find jobs, and many Americans bought homes for the first time. In the mid-1990s especially, the Internet and other new developments created a technology boom.</p>
<p>In addition, Clinton was an effective public speaker, and he inspired new groups of people to support his Democratic Party. Many voters approved of his appointments of women and minorities to positions of power in his government. They also liked the steps he took to reduce the use of handguns, protect the environment, and provide paid time off work for some people to care for themselves or their families.</p>
<p>But both Democrats and Republicans found fault with some of Clinton's efforts. And even his supporters note that the president had to spend much of his time in office answering charges of wrongdoing.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: We are pleased to share a traditional holiday story with you, 'The Gift of the Magi' by O. Henry. </em><em>Karen Leggett adapted this story for VOA Learning English. Your storyteller was Shep O'Neal. The producer was Lawan Davis.</em></p>
<p>One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it in the smallest pieces of money - pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by <strong>negotiating</strong> with the men at the market who sold vegetables and meat. Negotiating until one's face burned with the silent knowledge of being poor. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Gift of the Magi" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/36fb8ef4-a6ec-4ed7-a573-0924aaa83d0d_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Gift of the Magi</span></div>
<p>There was clearly nothing to do but sit down and cry. So Della cried. Which led to the thought that life is made up of little cries and smiles, with more little cries than smiles.</p>
<p>Della finished her crying and dried her face. She stood by the window and looked out unhappily at a gray cat walking along a gray fence in a gray back yard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only one dollar and eighty-seven cents to buy her husband Jim a gift. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result.</p>
<p>Jim earned twenty dollars a week, which does not go far. Expenses had been greater than she had expected. They always are. Many a happy hour she had spent planning to buy something nice for him. Something fine and rare -- something close to being worthy of the honor of belonging to Jim.</p>
<p>There was a tall glass mirror between the windows of the room. Suddenly Della turned from the window and stood before the glass mirror and looked at herself. Her eyes were shining, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Quickly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. and Mrs. James Dillingham Young had two possessions which they valued. One was Jim's gold time piece, the watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair.</p>
<p>Had the Queen of Sheba lived in their building, Della would have let her hair hang out the window to dry just to reduce the value of the queen's jewels.</p>
<p>So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, shining like a brown waterfall. It reached below her knees and made itself almost like a covering for her. And then quickly she put it up again. She stood still while a few tears fell on the floor.</p>
<p>She put on her coat and her old brown hat. With a quick motion and brightness still in her eyes, she danced out the door and down the street.</p>
<p>Where she stopped the sign read: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." Della ran up the steps to the shop, out of breath.</p>
<p>"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.</p>
<p>"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take your hat off and let us have a look at it."</p>
<p>Down came the beautiful brown waterfall of hair.</p>
<p>"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the hair with an experienced hand.</p>
<p>"Give it to me quick," said Della.</p>
<p>The next two hours went by as if they had wings. Della looked in all the stores to choose a gift for Jim.</p>
<p>She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. It was a chain -- simple round rings of silver. It was perfect for Jim's gold watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be for him. It was like him. Quiet and with great value. She gave the shopkeeper twenty-one dollars and she hurried home with the eighty-seven cents that was left.</p>
<p>When Della arrived home she began to repair what was left of her hair. The hair had been ruined by her love and her desire to give a special gift. Repairing the damage was a very big job.</p>
<p>Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny round curls of hair that made her look wonderfully like a schoolboy. She looked at herself in the glass mirror long and carefully.</p>
<p>"If Jim does not kill me before he takes a second look at me," she said to herself, "he'll say I look like a song girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"</p>
<p>At seven o'clock that night the coffee was made and the pan on the back of the stove was hot and ready to cook the meat.</p>
<p>Jim was never late coming home from work. Della held the silver chain in her hand and sat near the door. Then she heard his step and she turned white for just a minute. She had a way of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please God, make him think I am still pretty."</p>
<p>The door opened and Jim stepped in. He looked thin and very serious. Poor man, he was only twenty-two and he had to care for a wife. He needed a new coat and gloves to keep his hands warm.</p>
<p>Jim stopped inside the door, as <strong>immovable</strong> as a dog smelling a bird. His eyes were fixed upon Della. There was an <strong>expression</strong> in them that she could not read, and it frightened her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor fear, nor any of the feelings that she had been prepared for. He simply looked at her with a strange expression on his face. Della went to him.</p>
<p>"Jim, my love," she cried, "do not look at me that way. I had my hair cut and sold because I could not have lived through Christmas without giving you a gift. My hair will grow out again. I just had to do it. My hair grows very fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let us be happy. You do not know what a nice-- what a beautiful, nice gift I have for you."</p>
<p>"You have cut off your hair?" asked Jim, slowly, as if he had not accepted the information even after his mind worked very hard.</p>
<p>"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Do you not like me just as well? I am the same person without my hair, right?</p>
<p>Jim looked about the room as if he were looking for something.</p>
<p>"You say your hair is gone?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You need not look for it," said Della. "It is sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It is Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it was cut for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the meat on, Jim?"</p>
<p>Jim seemed to awaken quickly and put his arms around Della. Then he took a package from his coat and threw it on the table.</p>
<p>"Do not make any mistake about me, Dell," he said. "I do not think there is any haircut that could make me like my girl any less. But if you will open that package you may see why you had me frightened at first."</p>
<p>White fingers quickly tore at the string and paper. There was a scream of joy; and then, alas! a change to tears and cries, requiring the man of the house to use all his skill to calm his wife.</p>
<p>For there were the combs -- the special set of objects to hold her hair that Della had wanted ever since she saw them in a shop window. Beautiful combs, made of shells, with jewels at the edge --just the color to wear in the beautiful hair that was no longer hers. They cost a lot of money, she knew, and her heart had wanted them without ever hoping to have them. And now, the beautiful combs were hers, but the hair that should have touched them was gone.</p>
<p>But she held the combs to herself, and soon she was able to look up with a smile and say, "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"</p>
<p>Then Della jumped up like a little burned cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"</p>
<p>Jim had not yet seen his beautiful gift. She happily held it out to him in her open hands. The silver chain seemed so bright.</p>
<p>"Isn't it wonderful, Jim? I looked all over town to find it. You will have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."</p>
<p>Instead of obeying, Jim fell on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>
<p>"Dell," said he, "let us put our Christmas gifts away and keep them a while. They are too nice to use just right now. I sold my gold watch to get the money to buy the set of combs for your hair. And now, why not put the meat on."</p>
<p>The <strong>magi</strong> were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought gifts to the Baby Jesus. They invented the art of giving Christmas gifts. Being wise, their gifts were wise ones. And here I have told you the story of two young people who most unwisely gave for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that of all who give gifts, these two were the wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>

            <title>Indigenous Women Bring Amazon Tribe Back from Near Extinction  (2023/12/16)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>The Juma are native people of the Amazon rain forest area in Brazil. In the 1990s, there were only four people remaining in the tribe.</p>
<p>They were Aruká, the father, and his three daughters – Boreá, Mandeí and Maytá.</p>
<p>In 2021, Aruká died from COVID-19. The news appeared around the world. The <em>New York Times</em> newspaper wrote the "last man of his tribe" was gone and many people believed the tribe would go <strong>extinct</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Juma Indigenous sisters Mandei Juma, from left, Mayta Juma and Borea Juma pose for a picture at their community, near Canutama, Amazonas state, Brazil, Sunday, July 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner)</span></div>
<p>The tribe, in the past, was built upon the idea that men had to be in charge. Once the last man died, the tribe would no longer exist.</p>
<p>But the daughters had a different idea. Before Aruká died, he and his daughters started thinking about a way to keep the tribe alive by choosing a female leader.</p>
<p>Mandeí said her sisters and father wanted her to take the position. So, Mandeí became the first woman chief in the area.</p>
<p>Earlier in their lives, the Juma sisters married men from other tribes to make sure their family line could continue.</p>
<p>Over many years, the number of Juma people has grown. In the area that is now Juma territory, there is a lot of activity. Children play in the river. People catch fish. Women work to make flour from the cassava root. Others hunt in the forest.</p>
<p>They also gather at a community building called a maloca, to eat, take care of animals, rest, and use their phones. The building has mobile phone signal equipment.</p>
<p>Aruká, the last Juma male leader, is buried under the maloca.</p>
<p>Mandeí recently retired as leader. Her older sister, Boreá, is chief now.</p>
<p>Mandeí said she found leadership difficult, at first. She said other people did not treat the Juma with respect because the tribe was so small. People also opposed her leadership because she is female, she said.</p>
<p>It hurt her but did not stop her. "I <strong>adapted</strong> to seek solutions for our people," she said.</p>
<p>The Juma territory needs a strong leader. It is about the size of a large city, similar to Las Vegas, Nevada. Old-growth forest covers the land. A Juma leader's main job is to protect the territory and its natural wealth from outsiders.</p>
<p>People come and cut down the trees. They then use the cleared land to plant grasses that are used to raise animals.</p>
<p>The changes are damaging to the traditional life of native people. Developers plan to build a road nearby. The Juma say that will bring more people and industry to the area. Mandeí says the environment is already changing.</p>
<p>"The river doesn't fill with water as it used to ... The water shouldn't dry up so much like this. It's much hotter, it wasn't like this before. Our concern is: Why is this happening? Because of deforestation," she said.</p>
<p>The Juma people work to protect their land – they move around the territory by boat and even use <strong>drones</strong> to view their land from above.</p>
<p>Mandeí's nephew, Puré, is one of the guards. He said he is proud to be a Juma and protect the land.</p>
<p>He said he broke the rules and followed his mother's lineage. "If I don't identify myself as Juma, who else will?"</p>
<p>Puré's mother married a man from another tribe. When he was born, he was registered as a member of his father's tribe. But at 15, he decided to add the Juma name, his mother's name, to his name. He had to visit Brazil's indigenous people's office to make the change.</p>
<p>Two of his cousins also added Juma to their names.</p>
<p>There were not many Juma people to begin with. Experts on Brazil's native people say before non-indigenous people made contact with the Juma, there were probably a few thousand. The Juma fought the invaders and suffered major losses in battle. A book by a German Christian clergyman<strong> </strong>says the last attack on the Juma came in 1964. Over 30 people were killed, including Aruká's father.</p>
<p>Later, when Mandeí became the leader, she asked for help in saving the Juma language. In 2019, she invited a language expert to visit and help create a dictionary for use with mobile phones. They also created digital records of the language with stories, speeches, and songs in the Juma language.</p>
<p>Wesley dos Santos went to Brazil to work on the project. He is a graduate student at the University of California – Berkeley. He said the language, Kawahiva, is endangered. It is only used by 560 people. One of its variations is Juma, and there are seven others.</p>
<p>Mandeí said she is concerned that the language and the people who speak it will disappear one day. There are only 24 people living in the Juma village. The three sisters are still trying to decide how to pass down the Juma traditions to the people who come after them.</p>
<p>"The largest responsibility I share with my sisters is not to lose Juma culture as taught by our father," Mandeí said.</p>

            <title>Wondering About Wonder?  (2023/12/16)</title>

<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question about the word "wonder" as a noun and a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-36f1-08dbfc22883a_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>I am one of your followers from Iran.</p>
<p>I have question about the word "wonder."</p>
<p>How can I use it as a noun and a verb in a sentence in various ways?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ali</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>This is a great question, especially for the month of December, Ali. We sometimes describe Christmas as "the most wonderful time of the year." The expression comes from a song by Andy Williams.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>"Wonderful" mean full of wonder. But what exactly is "wonder?"</p>
<p>In today's Ask a Teacher will we answer your question by looking at "wonder" as a noun and a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Wonder as a noun</strong></p>
<p>"Wonder" is the feeling of surprise and <strong>amazement</strong> usually caused by something that is new, strange, unexpected or different. It can also be something that people can <strong>admire</strong> or love and want to protect.</p>
<p><em>The <strong>roaming</strong> cats of Old San Juan are one of the wonders of Puerto Rico.</em></p>
<p>You may have heard people say, "no wonder." This is another way of saying "it is not surprising." For example:</p>
<p><em>It is no wonder that the meeting started late. Everyone was stuck in traffic!</em></p>
<p>Now let's look at "wonder" as a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Wonder as verb</strong></p>
<p>"Wonder" can mean to be in a state of surprise.</p>
<p><em>I always wonder at Amaury Guichon's life-size chocolate <strong>sculptures</strong> of things like dragons and giraffes!</em></p>
<p>It can also mean to think about something because it interests you.</p>
<p><em>I wonder what the economy will be like after inflation.</em></p>
<p><em>Jessica wondered where her next vacation would be: Scotland or Thailand?</em></p>
<p>We can also use "wonder" to make <strong>formal</strong> and polite requests.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if you could pick me up at the train station next week.</em></p>
<p>"Wonder" can also be used as an adjective. We use "wonder" to describe something that is extraordinary.</p>
<p><em>Wonder Woman has superhuman strength and the ability to fly!</em></p>
<p><em>There were many wonder drugs developed in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including penicillin and insulin.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Ali.</p>

<p>Do you still leave home with money in your <strong>pocket</strong>?</p>
<p>Now that many stores have gone "cashless" and most people do not have money in their pocket, those who once depended on <strong>handouts</strong> from strangers often end the day empty-handed.</p>
<p>Many people without homes or jobs say they are not able to get much money from strangers anymore.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A vendor selling Street Sense holds up her sign saying she can accept donations from cashless apps like Venmo and CashApp, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/d2b79979-0c18-45d9-b926-870c16882d31_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A vendor selling Street Sense holds up her sign saying she can accept donations from cashless apps like Venmo and CashApp, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, in Washington.

<p>John Littlejohn is 62 years old and lives in Washington, D.C. He said he has been homeless for 13 years. In recent years, he said, people would tell him they left home without any money.</p>
<p>"I would be out here for six or seven hours and wouldn't get more than $12 to $15," he said.</p>
<p>People can use <strong>apps</strong> on their mobile phones to pay for most things, so they do not leave home with bills or coins. For a while, those without homes and <strong>charities</strong> that depended on <strong>spare</strong> change suffered.</p>
<p>But they are using technology, too.</p>
<p>Littlejohn sells copies of a newspaper called <em>Street Sense</em>. It is published by a nonprofit organization that says it helps homeless people. Now people who want to buy the newspaper can use an app. The money goes directly to the seller. Littlejohn is able to pay for an apartment with the money he gets from selling <em>Street Sense</em> and also other jobs he does.</p>
<p>Some people who stand outside public places such as subway stations and ask for money are called panhandlers. Sylvester Harris is one of them. He talked to a reporter near a subway station close to a large sports center in Washington, D.C. He said people often look like they want to give him money, but they do not have coins or bills.</p>
<p>"Everybody just has (credit cards) or their phones now," he said.</p>
<p>Homeless people often do not have bank accounts, credit cards or real identification that would permit them to use a mobile phone app to get money.</p>
<p>The cashless society also used to be a problem for a charity organization called the Salvation Army. The group is known for sending people to stand in busy places with a big red cooking pot, known as a kettle. People walk past the kettle and drop a dollar or a few coins inside.</p>
<p>However, as more people started using their phones and credit cards to make payments, the Salvation Army was receiving less money.</p>
<p>Now, the organization permits people to make donations by <strong>tapping</strong> their phones on the red kettle.</p>
<p>Michelle Wolf is with the Salvation Army in Washington. She said the technology is only available in a few places around the city, but it already has brought in more money.</p>
<p>Most people give $5 and often people give $20, she said.</p>
<p>The head of <em>Street Sense</em> said he started to see a problem about 10 years ago. Those who sold his newspapers said people did not have money to buy them.</p>
<p>"We were losing sales," said Brian Canmore. "Times were changing, and we had to change with them."</p>
<p>He heard that a similar newspaper in Vancouver, Canada created a payment app. Now the newspaper in Washington uses the same technology.</p>
<p>Thomas Ratliff also works for <em>Street Sense</em>. He is in charge of the 100 sellers around Washington. He said a big problem started in 2020 when many workers stayed home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He said people who came to Washington for work were the main buyers of the newspaper. Many of those people are still not coming into the city. Now the sellers take the subway to busier areas outside of Washington, D.C. in Maryland and Virginia to sell the papers.</p>
<p>Ratliff noted that some payment apps that do not require a bank account -- Venmo and Cash App – still require a steady mobile phone number. But the sellers often change their number and then they have trouble getting paid.</p>
<p>There is a way for homeless people without jobs to get money in the cashless society. They can use the Samaritan app. It permits people to give money to someone just by <strong>scanning</strong> a special <strong>code </strong>– a QR code – with their phone. People who scan the code can read a story about the person and donate money that is meant to be used for buying food or clothing.</p>
<p>Jon Kumar started the Samaritan app. Charities pay him to use his technology for their work. He said it is hard to walk past a person when you know their story. His app, he said, "personalizes the person in need."</p>
<p>The people who use the app to ask for money must meet with a case manager to claim their money. The manager can also help the person with services, such as directing them to counseling or drug <strong>rehabilitation</strong>.</p>
<p>None of the apps or new technology will solve every problem for homeless people. Many people do not have the ability to sell newspapers, for example. Others are too old to work so they depend on asking people for money. Not everyone has a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Kumar said some people are "not a great fit" for this kind of intervention. He said some people need more support than a phone app can offer.</p>

<p>An endangered bird in Indonesia could face new threats from development linked to the country's new capital city.</p>
<p>The bird is the maleo, a tall animal with black feathers and a pink chest. It is native to Indonesia's Sulawesi island and a few neighboring ones.</p>
<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers the maleo to be "critically endangered." The environmental group's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List</a> identifies wildlife across the world currently facing threats. The IUCN estimates only 8,000 to 14,000 adult maleos remain in the wild.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A pair of maleos look for a spot to lay an egg in Mamuju, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, Friday, Oct. 27, 2023.

<p>West Sulawesi has been set up as a "support" area for building activities. The Indonesian government plans to move the nation's capital from Jakarta to a new city on Borneo island. West Sulawesi and Borneo are separated by an ocean passageway called the Makassar Strait and are just a six-hour boat trip apart.</p>
<p>Support work will take place in areas around West Sulawesi's capital, Mamuju. The development is expected to include the building of new roads and seaports to be used to transport materials to the new capital, named Nusantara, on Borneo.</p>
<p>Activities include tree clearing, digging, and removing stones. The process already has changed the forest environment on West Sulawesi and is harming maleo <strong>nesting</strong> areas near the beach.</p>
<p>These latest changes follow others to the birds' general environment, or habitat, linked to human activities in the area. These changes have made the trip for maleos to lay their eggs increasingly more difficult.</p>
<p>The maleo is considered "critically endangered because the next step is <strong>extinction</strong>," said biologist Marcy Summers. She directs the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, a non-governmental organization working to support maleo <strong>conservation</strong> in the area. Summers noted that maleo populations had decreased by more than 80 percent since 1980.</p>
<p>Experts do not know how many maleos still live around Mamuju or across West Sulawesi island. The West Sulawesi Forestry Agency was only able to record the presence of nesting grounds in 23 villages based on reports from locals in the area. But of those, only 18 are considered active nesting areas.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, maleo birds are in <strong>decline</strong>," said Andi Aco Takdir, chief of the West Sulawesi Forestry Agency. He pointed to several reasons for the decline, including destruction of beach areas, and expanding human development activities.</p>
<p>Takdir said the government has been warning people in the area to stop establishing palm oil operations and to halt all other development around maleo nesting grounds.</p>
<p>Officials said the government is committed to keeping the birds even with massive development to support the new capital city.</p>
<p>Another problem has been thieves, also called poachers. The Associated Press reports that poachers steal maleo eggs from the sand where their parents have hidden them.</p>
<p>Poachers sell the eggs for about $1 to people as food. The eggs are a traditional gift for many people in Mamuju and other parts of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>Muhammad Idris is a local official in West Sulawesi. He told the AP that government officials there are prepared to take steps to protect the maleos even with the new capital development.</p>
<p>Idris said, "Nature conservation must be used as an <strong>achievement </strong>and (projects) must not be built leaving behind problems."</p>

            <title>Boston Common: America’s First Public Park  (2023/12/15)</title>

<span class="byline">By Gregory Stachel</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">14 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Almost 400 years ago, America's early European colonists voted to tax each household in Boston about $70 in today's money. The money was used to buy a local farm. The plan was to use it as a common area for the public.</p>
<p>That is how Boston Common, in the state of Massachusetts, became America's first public <strong>park.</strong></p>
<p>Liz Vizza is president of the Friends of the Public Garden, an organization that supports Boston Common. She noted that Bostonians did not have backyards – private outdoor spaces behind their homes. Boston Common, she said, became "their front yard and backyard and common ground. It was a place that everybody owned."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="America's Oldest Public Park" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-d371-08dbf4d37028_tv_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">America's Oldest Public Park</span></div>
<p>On any given day, colonists walking though Boston Common would see soldiers setting up camp or their neighbors taking walks. They may also have seen public punishments. Presidents George Washington and John Adams also visited the park.</p>
<p>Visitors would have seen cows, because everyone had the right to keep one cow per household in the area.</p>
<p>Today, visitors will find dogs instead of cows in the 20-hectare park. The cows became outlawed in 1830 as Boston Common became more of a place for <strong>recreation</strong>.</p>
<p>Friends of the Public Garden estimates that Boston Common sees 7 million visitors each year.</p>
<p>"Boston Common is a central stage of <strong>civic</strong> life in Boston and it's been that center stage of civic life for hundreds of years, ever since it began as a park in 1634," Vizza said. "America's oldest park is a place where we come to celebrate, we come to protest, we come to find a place alone," she added.</p>
<p>Boston Common is home to several large pieces of art. They include "The Embrace," a <strong>sculpture </strong>that shows civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. holding his wife, Coretta Scott King. The Brewer Fountain was the park's first public piece of art. It won the top award at the 1855 World's Fair in Paris, France.</p>
<p>The pieces of art found on the Common may soon change to include a wider selection of subjects.</p>
<p>Vizza said, "We want people to look at it with new eyes and just have a deeper understanding and respect and <strong>awareness</strong> of the history."</p>
<p>That history includes the native Massachusett tribe, the first people to live where the Common is now. The state of Massachusetts is named after the Massachusett people.</p>
<p>Vizza said, "People have lived on this land for 12,000 years. So, we do want to think about colonial America because that's a <strong>fascinating</strong> story for us. But what's an even more fascinating story is to <strong>peel</strong> those layers open to think about the Native Americans living here."</p>
<p>Vizza's team is working with tribal members to develop a piece to recognize the Massachusett tribe. They hope to have something in place by 2026, when America will celebrate its 250th birthday.</p>

<span class="datetime">14 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>We are entering a major gift-giving season in the United States. People purchase goods and services for their loved ones, friends, coworkers, and others.</p>
<p>But how do we talk about giving gifts? How do we use subjects, verbs, and objects to describe gift giving?</p>
<p>Those questions will be the subject of today's Everyday Grammar.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0aff-0242-0d3b-08dbfcbb1c81_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Let's start with some important terms and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Elements </strong></p>
<p>In <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.51voa.com/a/grammar-for-giving-gifts/7377191.html" target="_blank">a recent Everyday Grammar lesson</a>, we explored questions about gifts – asking what others might want in terms of a gift.</p>
<p>In today's lesson, we will talk about statements we might make after we purchase the gift.</p>
<p>Before we continue with the lesson, we need to identify the key elements of a sentence.</p>
<p>The simplest way to divide a sentence is into two parts: the subject and the <strong>predicate</strong>.</p>
<p>The subject is generally a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun.</p>
<p>The predicate, on the other hand, says something about the subject. The predicate contains a verb, objects, indirect objects, and so on.</p>
<p>Now that we have our basic building blocks of language, we should explore how to put them together.</p>
<p><strong>Putting elements together </strong></p>
<p>We will start with the predicate. Why? Because the predicate is central to today's lesson.</p>
<p>The language we use in the predicate to describe a gift purchase often falls into a simple <strong>pattern</strong>: transitive verb + noun <strong>phrase</strong> 1+noun phrase 2.</p>
<p>A transitive verb is one that takes a direct object. A direct object is the receiver of the verb's action.</p>
<p>So, in the pattern we just learned about, we can say that the transitive verb takes a noun phrase that acts like the direct object.</p>
<p>Finally, we might have a second noun phrase that acts like the indirect object – the person who receives the direct object.</p>
<p>Please note that the direct object does not always appear directly next to the verb, as we will see.</p>
<p>Some examples will clarify this explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Examples </strong></p>
<p>When we talk about gift giving, we often use three transitive verbs: get, buy, and give.</p>
<p>The direct object is the gift. The indirect object is the person receiving the gift.</p>
<p>So, let's imagine we have a friend named Mary. We might say the following about Mary's gift-giving decision:</p>
<p><em>Mary got her son a book.</em></p>
<p>In our example, the subject is Mary. The predicate is "got her son a book."</p>
<p>The direct object is "a book." What did Mary get? She got a book. Who is going to receive the book? Her son. In this case, "her son" is the indirect object.</p>
<p>So, in the sentence "Mary got her son a book," we can say that the structure is subject + transitive verb + noun phrase 1 + noun phrase 2.</p>
<p>Here are two other examples. Let's use the transitive verbs "buy" and "give":</p>
<p><em>Jonathan bought his mother a sweater.</em></p>
<p><em>Felicia gave her friend a painting.</em></p>
<p>All of these examples are in their past forms. But we can also use these verbs in other forms as well.</p>
<p><strong>Practice </strong></p>
<p>Let's take some time to work with these ideas. Create a sentence using the following elements:</p>
<p>The subject is "My father."</p>
<p>The predicate consists of the verb "get," the noun phrase "a <strong>vase</strong>," and the noun phrase "my mother."</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one possible answer:</p>
<p><em>My father got my mother a vase.</em></p>
<p>The order of the sentence is subject + transitive verb + indirect object + direct object.</p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts </strong></p>
<p>Today we explored one pattern we often use to describe gift giving. To be clear: we use other patterns as well.</p>
<p>One of these makes use of the prepositions "to" and "for." But that will have to be the subject of a future lesson.</p>

<p>Nearly 200 countries agreed on Wednesday to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels. The deal came after two weeks of intense negotiations at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28.</p>
<p>World leaders gathered in Dubai for the meeting. The agreement was meant to send a powerful message that the world is united in its desire to break with fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Scientists say the agreement is the last best hope to prevent climate <strong>catastrophe</strong>. But nations have not always followed climate agreements made in the past.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="U.N.

Climate Summit, on Dec. 13, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)</span></div>
<p>COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber called the deal "historic." He added that its true success would be in taking action. "We are what we do, not what we say," he said. "We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into... actions."</p>
<p>Norway's Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide said, "It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear <strong>text</strong> on the need to <strong>transition</strong> away from fossil fuels."</p>
<p>More than 100 countries had pushed for strong language in the COP28 agreement to "<strong>phase out</strong>" oil, gas, and coal use. However, they faced powerful opposition from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The organization controls nearly 80 percent of the world's proven oil reserves as well as about one-third of worldwide oil output. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, said the world can cut emissions without rejecting <strong>specific</strong> fuels.</p>
<p>That dispute had some observers worried that an agreement would not come together.</p>
<p>The lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, Anne Rasmussen, criticized the deal as not strong enough. But she did not officially object to the agreement. Her speech in Dubai drew a standing <strong>applause</strong> that lasted nearly two minutes.</p>
<p>Danish Minister for Climate and Energy Dan Jorgensen noted one reason the deal was impressive. "We're standing here in an oil country, surrounded by oil countries, and we made the decision saying let's move away from oil and gas," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Transitioning away from fossil fuels</strong></p>
<p>The deal does not call for "phasing out" fossil fuels. It calls for "transitioning away" from fossil fuels to reach "net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science."</p>
<p>In some ways, that language describes what is already happening. Some governments have enacted policies in recent years to move to a greener economy.</p>
<p>Europe and the United States have retired some coal-fired power plants. And many countries have policies meant to increase sales of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The deal calls on governments to move even faster in several areas. They include increasing renewable energy by three times by 2030, speeding up efforts to reduce coal use, and developing technologies such as carbon capture.</p>
<p>German climate diplomat Jennifer Morgan said there was not much difference between "phasing out" and "transitioning away." She said, "I think the ‘phase-out' was about sending a clear signal. And I think the ‘just transition away from' is a way of phrasing the phase-out" for poorer nations who cannot act as quickly as richer ones.</p>
<p>Li Shuo of the Asia Society told the Associated Press that when the two phrases are <strong>translated</strong> into Mandarin or Japanese, there is almost no difference.</p>
<p>The Reuters news agency reported that a source familiar with Saudi Arabia's position described the deal as "a menu where every country can follow its own pathway."</p>
<p>China, the world's biggest carbon polluter today, suggested that industrialized countries should take the lead.</p>
<p>Zhao Yingmin is China's vice environment minister. He said after the deal was approved, "Developed countries have...historical responsibilities for climate change."</p>

            <title>Jury Rules Google App Store Operates as Monopoly  (2023/12/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">13 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>An American jury has found that Google's app store operates as an illegal <strong>monopoly</strong>.</p>
<p>The decision came in a lawsuit brought by video game company Epic Games. The jury reached the decision this week in California after a four-week trial.</p>
<p>Epic had argued Google uses business methods that block competition against its Google Play Store. That is where users can download <strong>apps</strong> for smartphones and other devices using the Android operating system (OS). Google owns the Android OS. Epic uses Google Play and other app stores to sell its popular game Fortnite and others.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This March 23, 2010, file photo shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/03190000-0aff-0242-5ad4-08da3e6b9459_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Experts predict that if the ruling stands, it could cost Google billions of dollars in business. It could also change the way all app stores do business in the future. Google condemned the court's decision and said it will appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>Android holds by far the largest share of the mobile OS market worldwide. Online data researcher Statista <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/">estimated</a> in October that Android had a market share of 70.5 percent. The next closest competitor, Apple, held a market share of 28.8 percent.</p>
<p>Other companies, such as Apple, also operate app stores. Epic brought a similar lawsuit against Apple in 2021. In it, Epic argued Apple used methods in its app store that created a monopoly that blocked competition. A federal judge ruled mostly in Apple's favor in that case. Epic has appealed that ruling.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues in both cases was whether Google and Apple have the right to require developers to use the app store's payment systems. Such systems can take up to 30 percent of a sale in <strong>commissions</strong> from app developers.</p>
<p>In the case of Epic vs. Apple, the judge mostly sided with Apple. But the judge did find that Apple had used some unfair business methods which violated California law. The judge ordered Apple to permit developers across the United States to add their own links to process payments within iPhone apps.</p>
<p>Reuters news agency reported that Google's appeal will take place in the same court in San Francisco that decided Epic's case against Apple. Epic's appeal of the Apple decision is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The jury in the Epic vs. Google legal case debated for about three hours before giving its decision on Monday. It decided that Google's control of its Play Store amounted to an illegal monopoly. The monopoly covered both Google's app selling system and its payment processing method within the app, the jury found. Epic did not ask the court for financial damages.</p>
<p>Epic chief Tim Sweeney praised the court's decision on X, formerly known as Twitter. "Victory over Google!" Sweeney <a class="wsw__a" href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1734370774830797210">wrote</a>. In a company statement, Epic called the <strong>verdict</strong> "a win for all app developers and <strong>consumers</strong> around the world."</p>
<p>Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, Wilson White, confirmed the company's plan to appeal the ruling. In a statement, he said, "We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android <strong>ecosystem</strong>."</p>
<p>White added his opinion that the Google Play Store currently offers "more choice and openness" than any other major mobile provider.</p>
<p>Depending on how the court's ruling is enforced, Google could lose billions of dollars yearly in commissions on sales through the Play Store. But the company's main source of earnings, online advertising, would not be directly affected by the court's decision.</p>
<p>The case now goes back to the judge in the trial, U.S. District Judge James Donato. He will hear arguments on both sides about how Google should change its business operations to improve fair competition. The judge has suggested this process could begin in the second week of January.</p>
<p>During those hearings, Google will be able to argue against the changes proposed by Epic. In addition, any orders established by the judge at the end could be appealed. These processes, technology experts say, could result in the case extending for many months, or possibly years.</p>

<p>News reporters, politicians and public <strong>figures</strong> have had trouble saying some of the words that relate to the top stories of the year year. Last week, the online language learning company Babbel released its lists of the most <strong>mispronounced</strong> words in the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The two lists are a reminder of the year's news on everything from scientific discoveries to politics.</p>
<p>Babbel teacher Malcolm Massey noted the <strong>diversity</strong> of the words. This year's words come from several different languages.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - SZA arrives at the 64th annual Grammy Awards, April 3, 2022, in Las Vegas.

</span></div>
<p>"I think a lot of it is due to how close our cultures have become because of how <strong>globalized</strong> things are," Massey said.</p>
<p><strong>Singers, actors and politicians</strong></p>
<p>A popular singer who spells her name S-Z-A is on the U.S. list. Babbel notes her name is pronounced SIZ-uh,[short I sound].</p>
<p>The first name of another entertainer is also on the list. Cillian Murphy is an Irish actor who starred in this summer's hit as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. His first name is pronounced KI-lee-uhn.</p>
<p>Other pronunciations on the U.S. list include the name of biotech businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a Republican presidential candidate. The correct way to say his name is Vih-VAKE Rah-mah-SWAH-me.</p>
<p>Two volcanoes were also on the list — Mexico's Popocatepetl, (Poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-til), and Hawaii's Kilauea, (Kee-lou-EY-uh).</p>
<p>The winning word at this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee also made the U.S. list. That word was psammophile (SAM-uh-file.) It means any animal or plant that prefers sandy soils or areas.</p>
<p>The <strong>coronation</strong> of King Charles in May helped put the Stone of Scone, (Stown uhv Skoon), on Britain's list. The holy stone rests beneath the Coronation Chair where a new king first receives his crown.</p>
<p>Kristie Denlinger teaches <strong>linguistics</strong> at the University of Texas in Austin. She said hearing an unfamiliar word often enough can help someone master it.</p>
<p>"Anything that is kind of different from what a speaker is used to, they can learn how to pronounce things in different ways than what they're used to, it just takes more <strong>exposure</strong>," Denlinger said.</p>
<p><strong>A personal choice</strong></p>
<p>Massey said that as one learns a new pronunciation, it is important to "not stress perfection but progress over time, so practicing these words again and again."</p>
<p>In some cases, the correct pronunciation is just a matter of personal choice. Earning a place on the U.S. list was the last name of Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs' American football player. Whether Kelce should be pronounced with one or two syllables, Kels or KEL-See, has been a subject even his own family talks about.</p>
<p>Both Travis and his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, say their last name as KEL-see. On a <strong>podcast</strong>, they discussed with their father, Ed Kelce, how that pronunciation came to be.</p>
<p>"I got tired of correcting people," said Ed Kelce, who said that his co-workers always called him KEL-see.</p>
<p>Jason Kelce then asks: "Should we go by Kels or KEL-see?" His father answers: "Do whatever you want. I did."</p>

            <title>Gates Foundation Takes on Poverty in US  (2023/12/14)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Novak</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">13 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>In recent years, city leaders in Grand Island, Nebraska, observed that many workers and students were walking or riding long distances to their jobs or schools. So when city administrator, Laura McAloon, learned of a chance to study the development of a bus system to meet those transportation needs, she took it.</p>
<p>The study received support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation along with the International City/County Management Association.</p>
<p>It sent McAloon to Washington, D.C. along with other local leaders to learn about policies to lift people in their community out of poverty.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Laura McAloon, Grand Island City Administrator, poses for a photo on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, in Grand Island, Nebraska. (AP Photo/John Peterson)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-0a00-0242-6817-08dbfa6e13bc_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Laura McAloon, Grand Island City Administrator, poses for a photo on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, in Grand Island, Nebraska. (AP Photo/John Peterson)</span></div>
<p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced last week that it will donate $100 million to expand its work on reducing poverty in the U.S. The commitment is part of the $460 million the foundation said in 2022 it would donate over four years to this area of need. The foundation says it is looking to quicken the speed at which its gifts have an <strong>impact</strong>.</p>
<p>Ryan Rippel is a founding director for economic strategy at the Gates Foundation. He said the large donations represent an important change in its strategy and give <strong>grantees</strong> more power in directing their own work.</p>
<p><strong>Goal to help 50 million Americans</strong></p>
<p>The investment is a small part of the foundation's overall budget, which was $7 billion last year. But it has quickly grown. The expansion of their work, Rippel said, depends on whether they meet their goal of improving economic <strong>mobility</strong> for 50 million people in the U.S. who are just above the poverty level with a yearly <strong>income</strong> of $29,160.</p>
<p>The foundation will give money to organizations working to expand support for local government using evidence -based policies that improve economic mobility. That includes policies that connect people with skills without college degrees to jobs, helping people receive government <strong>benefits</strong> and pushing businesses to change working conditions to improve work-life balance.</p>
<p>The grantees include Opportunity@Work, Families and Workers Fund, Prosperity Now, Pacific Community Ventures, Results for America and the Urban Institute.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Washington, D.C., in May, the Urban Institute introduced the tools and research they have developed to help cities and counties understand barriers to economic mobility. There, McAloon from Grand Island realized that her city of 53,000 needed to collect more information.</p>
<p>By the end of the meeting, they had changed their objectives and launched a data collective and analysis project. That included <strong>surveying</strong> local citizens and working with the human resources departments of major local employers.</p>
<p>What the city learned is that transportation had been a problem for workers. But when the meatpacking plant and other manufacturers raised wages after the pandemic, many households were able to pay for cars. Now the problem, the employers said, was housing.</p>
<p>At the close of Grand Island's research study this fall, McAloon said they found it would not be possible to set up a bus system under federal rules. Instead, they are exploring a transportation <strong>pool</strong> that is partially paid for by employers and the state.</p>
<p>The study led to new communication and cooperation across agencies, schools and local organizations. And McAloon's office learned that a lack of plumbers and electricians was holding up new housing developments. So, she reached out to the community college, which is now setting up a technical training program in high schools.</p>
<p>"It was a matter of a couple of emails," she said. "And they're already working on ... making an impact on that issue that's keeping us from building more houses."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>European nations reached an agreement on rules for artificial intelligence (AI) last week. Some experts say the regulations will affect people around the world.<br/>
欧洲国家上周就人工智能规定达成协议。一些专家表示，这些规定将影响到世界各地人们。</p>
<p>Here are some of the details of the agreement reported by the Associated Press:<br/>
以下是美联社报道的一些协议细节：</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The AI Act and how it works:<br/>
《人工智能法案》及其运作方式：</span></p>
<p>The AI Act aims to regulate or establish guidelines for AI technology that has the potential to cause problems if misused.<br/>
《人工智能法案》旨在规范或制定人工智能技术的指导方针，如果滥用，人工智能技术可能会引发问题。</p>
<p>AI systems that recommend online material, or those that check email messages, would be less regulated. But technology that concerns healthcare or medical decisions would have higher requirements.<br/>
推荐在线材料或检查电子邮件的人工智能系统将受到较少的监管。但涉及医疗保健或医疗决策的技术将有更高的要求。</p>
<p>Some AI systems will be banned except in some cases. They include systems that scan people's faces in public and systems that make predictions about future behavior such as whether a person will commit a crime.<br/>
除某些情况外，一些人工智能系统将被禁止。它们包括在公共场合扫描人们面部的系统，以及预测未来行为（如一个人是否会犯罪）的系统。</p>
<p>The new AI Act will not take effect until two years after a vote from European lawmakers. The vote is planned for the first part of next year. The soonest it would be in place is sometime early in 2026.<br/>
新的《人工智能法案》要到欧洲立法者投票两年后才能生效。投票计划在明年上半年进行。它最快将在2026年初生效。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How will the Act affect the world?<br/>
该法案将如何影响世界？</span></p>
<p>Some experts say the guidelines could become a global standard. That has happened before. One recent European decision caused U.S. company Apple to stop using its lightning data cable in favor of a more widely used cable.<br/>
一些专家表示，这些指导方针可能会成为一项全球标准。这种情况以前也发生过。欧洲最近的一项决定导致美国苹果公司停止使用其闪电接口数据线，转而使用一种更广泛使用的数据线。</p>
<p>Experts say Europe's rules might be used as a blueprint in other parts of the world. Anu Bradford is a professor at Columbia University in New York City. She called Europe's act "comprehensive" and "a game-changer." Bradford noted the European rules will "show the world AI can be governed."<br/>
专家表示，欧洲的规定可能会被用作世界其他地区的蓝图。阿努·布拉德福德是纽约哥伦比亚大学的教授。她称欧洲的法案是“全面的”和“游戏规则的改变者”。布拉德福德指出，欧洲的规定将“向世界表明人工智能是可以治理的”。</p>
<p>Rights groups complained that Europe's decision to not completely ban the use of facial recognition "is a missed opportunity." Amnesty International noted that Europe did not ban exports of AI technology that covers social scoring. Social scoring systems permit governments to record how well citizens follow rules.<br/>
人权组织抱怨说，欧洲没有完全禁止使用面部识别的决定是“错过了一个机会”。大赦国际指出，欧洲没有禁止出口涵盖社会评分的人工智能技术。社会评分系统允许政府记录公民遵守规则的程度。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the U.S. and China doing?<br/>
美国和中国在做什么？</span></p>
<p>In the United States, President Joe Biden signed an executive order in October on AI. Biden required AI technology companies to share test results and other information with the government. Government organizations will create requirements for AI tools that must be followed before systems are released for public use.<br/>
在美国，乔·拜登总统于10月签署了一项关于人工智能的行政命令。拜登要求人工智能技术公司与政府共享测试结果和其他信息。政府组织将对人工智能工具提出要求，在系统发布供公众使用之前必须遵守这些要求。</p>
<p>China released rules for AI tools that create material such as photos, text and videos. The rules are only short-term guidelines. President Xi Jinping also called for an open and fair environment for AI development around the world.<br/>
中国发布了创建照片、文本和视频等材料的人工智能工具的规定。这些规定只是短期的指导方针。习主席还呼吁为世界各地人工智能技术发展创造公开、公正的环境。</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will Europe's rules change ChatGPT?<br/>
欧洲的规定会改变ChatGPT吗？</span></p>
<p>The rise of ChatGPT, an AI tool based in the U.S., is one of the reasons for Europe's new set of rules. Europe's rules include guidelines for chatbots and other AI systems that can do jobs such as writing, creating video and writing computer code.<br/>
总部位于美国的人工智能工具ChatGPT的兴起是欧洲制定新规则的原因之一。欧洲的规则包括针对聊天机器人和其他人工智能系统的指导方针，这些系统可以完成写作、创建视频和编写计算机代码等工作。</p>
<p>Systems must clearly show where the material that went into training the bots came from. They also must show how much energy was used to train the systems, or models. They should be open about how they control the data that comes from their tool's users. And they need to observe the EU's copyright property protection laws.<br/>
系统必须清楚地显示用于训练机器人的材料来自哪里。他们还必须显示有多少能源用于训练系统或模型。他们应该公开如何控制来自工具用户的数据。他们还需要遵守欧盟的版权保护法。</p>
<p>High technology systems or risky uses of AI are required to follow stricter rules. Those include systems that create basic pieces of information, such as computer code, that others will then use to create other AI systems.<br/>
高科技系统或人工智能的高风险使用需要遵守更严格的规则。其中包括创建基本信息的系统，如计算机代码，然后其他人将使用这些信息创建其他人工智能系统。</p>

<p>Brazilian officials say bird flu has killed nearly 1,000 seals and sea lions in the country's south.</p>
<p>As of December 11, the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul had confirmed 942 sea mammal deaths. The animals were infected with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, also known as bird flu.</p>
<p>The first cases of the sickness were reported in Brazil in 2023. During past outbreaks in Europe and America, agriculture industries have killed hundreds of millions of farm animals to try to contain the disease.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Oceanologist Liane Dias photographs a dead porpoise on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, during an outbreak of Bird Flu, in Sao Jose do Norte, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, November 21, 2023.

<p>Officials at Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said preventive measures were put in place after the first report of bird flu in May. This action made it possible to avoid an outbreak on <strong>poultry</strong> farms. That kind of outbreak, officials say, would have likely led to a ban on such exports from Brazil, the world's top chicken exporter.</p>
<p>Silvina Botta studies oceans and sea life at Brazil's Rio Grande Federal University. She told Reuters news agency the remains of dead animals need to be buried or burned as soon as possible to prevent further disease spread.</p>
<p>Scientists have found some sea mammals <strong>convulsing</strong> along local beaches, as the virus attacks their nervous system, Reuters reported. Botta said that under government health rules, the animals must be killed immediately to prevent their suffering.</p>
<p>Botta added that the first case of bird flu-related sea mammal deaths in the area came in September. That is when local scientists first became aware of a large increase in disease deaths. Three towns in the state still have active bird flu outbreaks.</p>
<p>Botta said the spread among sea mammals appears to have started in Peru and then reached the South American continent. The disease has also affected wildlife in Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Brazil's Agriculture Ministry has reported 148 bird flu outbreaks in the country, mostly along the coast. Officials have declared a health emergency to contain the disease, which it says "is not yet considered <strong>endemic</strong> in Brazil."</p>
<p>The virus has also affected other animal populations in the country. In addition to the outbreaks among seabirds, seals and sea lions, researchers have collected remains of dead porpoises and penguins found on beaches. Officials say they have not yet confirmed those deaths were also from bird flu.</p>

            <title>Study: Student Learning Decreased in Math, Reading Worldwide  (2023/12/13)</title>

<span class="datetime">12 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Students around the world suffered historic <strong>setbacks</strong> in reading and math during the COVID-19 pandemic. That information comes from results of the latest Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).</p>
<p>The PISA is an international comparative study of the <strong>scores</strong> of 15-year-old students on tests in reading, math and science. Nearly 700,000 students took part in the study.</p>
<p>PISA is administered every three years. The latest results showed an "unprecedented drop in performance" since 2018.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Math teacher Doug Walters sits among empty desks as he takes part in a video conference with other teachers to prepare for at-home learning at Twentynine Palms Junior High School in Twentynine Palms, Calif., Aug. 18, 2020.

<p>The PISA 2022 study was supposed to happen in 2021. But it was postponed because of the pandemic. The 2022 results were released on December 5. It is the first extensive study with data on how the pandemic has affected student performance around the world.</p>
<p>The study looked at 81 education systems. They include 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). OECD has been administering the test since 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing scores</strong></p>
<p>The study found decreasing test scores in both rich and poor countries.</p>
<p>Andreas Schleicher is the director for education and skills at OECD. He said, "The world is no longer divided between rich and well-educated countries and poor and badly educated countries."</p>
<p>The study found the average international math score fell by 15 points since 2018. Reading scores across <strong>participating</strong> countries fell by 10 points. The OECD considers 20 points to be equal to one year of learning. Scores did not change in a major way in science.</p>
<p>Albania saw the biggest decrease in math scores, with a massive 69-point decrease. That means Albanian students lost more than three years of learning. Many countries fell by more than one year's worth of learning in math, including Germany, Iceland and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>Some Good News</strong></p>
<p>Four places did improve their performance between PISA 2018 and 2022 in all three subjects: Brunei, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Six East Asian education systems outperformed all other countries in math. Scores in Singapore were measurably higher than all other countries in all three subjects.</p>
<p>The math scores for U.S. students were about even with the international average. Science and reading were slightly higher.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a major reason for the worldwide score drops. But science and reading scores were dropping even before the pandemic. This suggests there are other reasons for the decrease.</p>
<p><strong>Factors</strong> such as the level of investment in education, the social value and pay levels of teachers, and educational beliefs of students have all influenced educational results, the OECD's Schleicher said.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of PISA</strong></p>
<p>The PISA tests explore how well students can solve complex problems, think critically and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>The goal of PISA is to provide useful information to educators and policymakers on the strengths and weaknesses of their country's education system.</p>
<p>OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann released the latest PISA results in Paris. He said, "PISA 2022 helps to identify the comparative strengths of education systems that have performed well <strong>despite</strong> recent shocks."</p>
<p>Policymakers can use such information to consider reforms to education systems for a brighter, more financially successful future, Cormann added.</p>
<p>The study also reported on the fast-changing influence of technology on educational performance. The results found that moderate use of electronic devices in school is connected to higher performance.</p>
<p><strong>Test your skills</strong></p>
<p>Khan Academy is a popular test prep web site. It offers a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/oecd-pisa" target="_blank">free PISA quiz</a>. You can see example questions and compare your math skills against the 15-year-old students from around the world who took the PISA 2022.</p>

<p>United States health officials last week approved two gene treatments for sickle cell disease. Doctors hope that the treatments will provide a cure for the painful genetic blood disorder.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the one-time treatments can be used for patients 12 and older with severe forms of the disease.</p>
<p>One treatment is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. The other is made by Bluebird Bio.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This photo provided on Oct. 25, 2023 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows crescent-shaped red blood cells from a sickle cell disease patient in 1972.

<p>"Sickle cell disease is a... life-threatening blood disorder with significant unmet need," the FDA's Dr. Nicole Verdun said in a statement announcing the approvals. "We are excited to <strong>advance</strong> the field especially for individuals whose lives have been severely disrupted by the disease."</p>
<p>Sickle cell disease (or SCD) affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is common in places with high cases of malaria, like Africa and India. Scientists believe being a carrier of SCD helps protect against severe malaria.</p>
<p>It is more common among Black Americans, Africans, and Middle Easterners than other population groups. The World Health Organization <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/sickle-cell-disease">said</a> many children with the most severe form of the disease die before the age of five, usually from an infection or severe blood loss.</p>
<p><strong>The new treatments</strong></p>
<p>A genetic change, or mutation, causes blood cells to become defective in people with sickle cell disease. The unhealthy blood cells result in blockages, called blood clots. The clots cause pain and damage to bones and organs in the human body.</p>
<p>The Vertex treatment is called Casgevy. Its goal is to help the body go back to producing healthy blood cells that are present at birth. It uses CRISPR, the gene editing tool, to <strong>knock out</strong> a gene in stem cells collected from the patient.</p>
<p>Bluebird's treatment, called Lyfgenia, aims to add copies of a modified gene. The modified gene helps red blood cells to produce a protein that prevents or <strong>reverses</strong> unhealthy cells.</p>
<p>The two gene treatments are the first approved in the U.S. for sickle cell disease. Vertex is already approved in Britain and Bahrain.</p>
<p>The new treatments are costly. The cost for Bluebird Bio is $3.1 million and for Vertex, $2.2 million. To help cover the cost, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says it plans to create partnerships with state Medicaid agencies and drug companies.</p>
<p>Even with the high cost, many patients say they would consider the gene treatment because of the seriousness of the disease.</p>
<p>Jalen Matthews of Louisville, Kentucky, was diagnosed with sickle cell at birth. She had her first pain <strong>episode</strong> at age 9. Three years later, the disease led to a spinal cord stroke that left her with some <strong>paralysis</strong> in her left arm and leg.</p>
<p>"I had to learn how to walk again, feed myself, clothe myself, basically learn how to do everything all over again," said Matthews, who is now 26.</p>
<p>Today, she deals with the disease by having <strong>blood</strong> <strong>transfusions</strong>. About every two months, the treatment replaces five units of her blood with healthy cells. She said she plans to ask her doctor about the new treatments.</p>
<p>"This one-time kind of cure is very much needed," Matthews said.</p>
<p>Studies testing the treatments suggest they work well. Of 31 people treated in the Vertex study with enough follow-up, 29 were free of pain episodes for at least a year. In the Bluebird study, 28 of 32 patients had no severe pain or organ damage between six and 18 months after the treatment.</p>
<p>But doctors note there are possible side effects. They also say the long-term results are unknown. For both treatments, the required chemotherapy comes with risks such as infertility, hair loss and serious infections.</p>
<p>With the Bluebird treatment, blood cancer has happened. The FDA said it will include a "black box warning" about that risk.</p>
<p>With the Vertex therapy, some scientists worry that CRISPR brings the possibility of "off-target effects." These are unexpected changes to a person's genome.</p>

<p>Everyone expected Japan's Shohei Ohtani to receive the biggest deal in baseball history. Over the weekend, the two-time Most Valuable Player award-winner received the biggest deal in team sports<em> </em>history.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Japanese star announced that he had agreed to a 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers valued at $700 million.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://olympics.com/en/news/ohtani-shohei-mega-deal-top-10-richest-contrcts-mbappe-messi-ronaldo">Olympics.com</a> says the amount is higher than the $679 million for France's Kylian Mbappe with Paris Saint-Germain in 2022, $674 million for Lionel Messi with Barcelona in 2017, and Cristiano Ronaldo's $500 million agreement with Al Nassr.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Japan's Shohei Ohtani, of the Los Angeles Angels acknowledges the crowd after receiving the trophy for leading vote-getter during the MLB All-Star baseball game in Seattle, Tuesday, July 11, 2023.

<p>The total is also higher than the largest American football contract of $450 million given to Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. It far exceeds the baseball deals of $426.5 million given to Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels and the $360 million given to Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>Under the contract, Ohtani's average yearly salary of $70 million is well above the <strong>previous</strong> high of about $43 million that pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander struck with the New York Mets. His average yearly <strong>salary</strong> is also higher than the combined salary of all players with the Baltimore Orioles or the Oakland A's this year.</p>
<p>Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, called it "a <strong>unique</strong>, historic contract for a unique, historic player." Another sports agent, Leigh Steinberg said, "He's rocketed into a <strong>stratosphere</strong> all his own."</p>
<p><strong>Is he worth it?</strong></p>
<p>Ohtani started in Major League Baseball with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. He is the sport's best two-way player. He is one of the best hitters and also one of the best <strong>pitchers</strong> in baseball. He is the only player in baseball history to appear as both a pitcher and a hitter in the All-Star games in 2021 and 2023. He was unanimously named the Most Valuable Player twice in 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>But the $700 million deal was more than most baseball fans imagined. And many wonder why the Dodgers made that kind of investment in one player.</p>
<p>Mike Lewis teaches marketing and sports business at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He said, "Baseball has sometimes struggled to gain national attention, but he's the kind of guy who attracts millions...and not just from the U.S."</p>
<p>Lewis compared the Dodgers' signing of Ohtani to Inter Miami's signing of Lionel Messi in Major League Soccer. Interest in American soccer, especially on social media, greatly increased around the U.S. and the world. As of Sunday morning, the Dodgers' Instagram account had 3.2 million followers. Ohtani on his own has 6.3 million.</p>
<p>No baseball player has received more interest internationally than Ohtani, especially in his native Japan. Japanese companies paid for top advertising spaces in Anaheim when Ohtani was playing with the Angels. His Angels <strong>uniform</strong> is the best-selling one among baseball players in 2023. Ohtani's uniform is expected to sell well, and many more Dodgers' tickets are expected to be sold, too.</p>
<p>When Ohtani was negotiating with different baseball teams for a new contract, fans were following his movements and posting information online. The interest was similar to the level around popular singer Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Steinberg, the sports agent, believes every baseball team interested in Ohtani has already estimated how much money he would bring to the team. If the Dodgers were willing to pay $700 million to sign him, then Steinberg believes they made a good decision.</p>
<p>"He's handsome and he's a huge <strong>box office draw</strong>," Steinberg told the <em>Associated Press</em>. "There are very few players who can match that. He has appeal to all."</p>

            <title>Nickel Mine, Environmental Activists Exist Together in Michigan  (2023/12/12)</title>

<span class="byline">By Dan Friedell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">11 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>About 20 years ago, the international mining company Rio Tinto said it would open a nickel mine in the far northern part of the American state of Michigan.</p>
<p>Rio Tinto promised good jobs for people in the area close to Canada.</p>
<p>But environmental activists had concerns. They were worried about industrial pollution from the metal, the mining byproducts and <strong>contaminated</strong> water runoff into rivers and lakes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This May 8, 2014, photo shows the opening to the Eagle Mine in western Marquette County, Michigan. (AP Photo/John Flesher)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-7124-08dbe6170e3b_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This May 8, 2014, photo shows the opening to the Eagle Mine in western Marquette County, Michigan. (AP Photo/John Flesher)</span></div>
<p>Many observers expected a long legal fight between the two sides. Some did not believe the mine would ever open.</p>
<p>But the Eagle mine has been open for more than 10 years. There have been no accidents or pollution problems.</p>
<p>People in the area who once protested the mine have found a way to exist with the mine.</p>
<p>Maura Davenport is one of those people. She is one of the top leaders of the Superior Watershed Partnership (SWP), an environmental interest group.</p>
<p>"I was fiercely opposed to the mine, and I changed," she said.</p>
<p>Davenport's group was invited to act as a "watchdog" for the mine. Rio Tinto asked the group to oversee pollution testing that has higher <strong>standards</strong> than <strong>regulators</strong> require.</p>
<p>The cooperation between the environmental group and the mining company may be an example for other mines around the world.</p>
<p>Many new mines are opening in order to provide minerals needed to make <strong>items</strong> used by the green energy economy. These items include <strong>batteries</strong>, electrical wire and magnets.</p>
<p>If countries around the world are to meet the climate goals set in Paris in 2015, there needs to be a 400-percent increase in the production of these minerals. The International Energy Agency said there needs to be an increase of 19 times in nickel production alone.</p>
<p>Davenport said the Eagle mine proposal "divided our community." Other mines in northern Michigan had opened in the 1800s and closed in the 1930s. The mining companies left behind large open holes and environmental damage. Water that ran from the mine polluted Lake Superior, one of the Great Lakes in the northern Midwest.</p>
<p>Simon Nish worked for Rio Tinto when the Eagle mine was proposed. He said he understands the "<strong>dilemma</strong>" that communities face. They need jobs and an economic <strong>benefit</strong>, he said, but "don't want long-term environmental consequences."</p>
<p>Residents do not trust the big mining companies he said, so it makes it easier to say no to proposals.</p>
<p>He worked in Australia in the 1990s when mining companies wanted to use land where native Aboriginal people lived. He said he learned that businesses need to "understand the interests of both sides" if they want long-term success.</p>
<p>When Nish arrived in Michigan in 2011, the mine was under <strong>construction</strong>. But it faced several legal disputes. In order to find a way for the mine to open, Nish considered looking for a partner.</p>
<p>Nish said the Superior Watershed Partnership was already testing water around the area. He asked if they would consider running an environmental testing program for the mine.</p>
<p>Over a few months, Rio Tinto and the SWP made a plan for testing. The group required open <strong>access</strong> to the mine. It would also test groundwater in the surrounding area. And it required permission to test a processing center 30 kilometers away. Rio Tinto was required to pay for the work.</p>
<p>The agreement launching the Community Environmental Monitoring Program was signed in 2012. More than 10 years later, no major pollution problems have turned up.</p>
<p>But some environmental groups are still concerned. Rochelle Dale is head of the Yellow Dog Watershed Preserve. She said Eagle mine and the testing program are doing good work.</p>
<p>But, she said, "a lot of the sulfide mines in the past haven't really had a problem until after closure. It's something that our grandchildren are going to <strong>inherit</strong>."</p>
<p>As more mines open up to help meet the world's demand for new minerals, mining companies are starting to understand how important local support is to their success.</p>
<p>The partnership in Northern Michigan gives large mining companies a "<strong>road map</strong>." But, although it has been successful so far, there is no guarantee that an accident will not happen that pollutes the area in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>Four years ago, country music star Brad Paisley and his wife, actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley, helped create a free food store in Nashville, Tennessee. Their goal was to give families in need the ability to choose their own food in a place that felt like a normal store. They named it The Store.<br/>
四年前，乡村音乐明星布拉德·佩斯利和他的妻子、演员金伯利·威廉姆斯-佩斯利在田纳西州纳什维尔市帮助创建了一家免费食品店。他们的目标是让有需要的家庭能够在一个感觉像普通商店的地方自行挑选食物。他们把它命名为The Store。</p>
<p>The Store is a partnership with Nashville's Belmont University, where Paisley earned his degree.<br/>
The Store是纳什维尔市贝尔蒙特大学的合作伙伴，佩斯利在该校获得了他的学位。</p>
<p>The Store is turning into a free toy store ahead of the Christmas holiday. The event began Friday. For two days, chosen families could pick out new toys, video games, stuffed animals, makeup and other gifts.<br/>
圣诞节假期前，The Store将变成一家免费的玩具店。该活动于周五开始。在为期两天的时间里，被选中的家庭可以挑选新玩具、电子游戏、毛绒玩具、化妆品和其它礼物。</p>
<p>Paisley said, "The emotional aspect of being able to give your child something your child wanted versus just something to sort of get you through the holidays...that's such a load off the minds of somebody who maybe didn't think they were going to be able to do that."<br/>
佩斯利说：“能够给孩子一些他们想要的东西，而不仅仅是度过假期的东西的这种情感，对于那些可能认为自己无法做到这一点的人来说，这是他们思想上的沉重负担。”</p>
<p>Paisley and Williams-Paisley brought the idea of a free food store to Nashville after seeing a similar effort in California. The Store launched in early 2020. Its opening came just weeks after a powerful tornado hit the area and shortly before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made food access an urgent problem.<br/>
佩斯利和威廉姆斯-佩斯利在加利福尼亚州看到类似措施后，将免费食品店的想法带到了纳什维尔市。该店于2020年初开业。它刚好赶在一场强大的龙卷风袭击了该地区的几周后，也是新冠肺炎大流行开始前不久。新冠疫情使食品供应成为一个紧迫的问题。</p>
<p>The Store changed its methods to meet people's needs. It turned into a food delivery service for older people. It delivered one million meals in its first year of operation.<br/>
The Store转变了方式来满足人们的需求。它变成了为老年人提供的送餐服务。它在运营的第一年就送出了100万份餐食。</p>
<p>Along with the food store, Belmont University also offers additional services to families in need. They include financial education and music therapy.<br/>
除了这家食品店，贝尔蒙特大学还为有需要的家庭提供额外的服务。其中包括金融教育和音乐治疗。</p>
<p>"People come on hard times and we want this to be a safe, welcoming place for everybody, whether you're volunteering or whether you're needing the services," Williams-Paisley said. "It's just a community and we're all in it together."<br/>
威廉姆斯-佩斯利说：“人们在困难时期到来，我们希望这里对每个人来说都是一个安全、受欢迎的地方，无论你是在做志愿者还是需要服务。这只是一个社区，我们都在其中。”</p>
<p>For this year's toy store event, The Store received about 2,000 donated objects and raised $20,000. Volunteers and workers from Belmont University in Nashville spent hours opening and organizing all of the donated toys into different areas.<br/>
在今年的玩具商店活动中，The store收到了大约2000件捐赠物品，并筹集了20000美元。纳什维尔市贝尔蒙特大学的志愿者和工作人员花了几个小时将所有捐赠的玩具打开并整理到不同的区域。</p>
<p>Parents will be able to drop off their kids at a religious center nearby, where they can play and drink a hot chocolate. The adults can pick out gifts at the same time.<br/>
家长们可以把孩子送到附近的宗教中心，在那里他们可以玩耍并喝一杯巧克力热饮。与此同时成年人可以挑选礼物。</p>
<p>Paisley said Christmas is his favorite time of year. He said he might even visit The Store dressed as Santa Claus, the make-believe person who brings gifts for children on Christmas.<br/>
佩斯利说圣诞节是他一年中最喜欢的时间。他说，他甚至可能打扮成圣诞老人的样子去The Store，圣诞老人是一个在圣诞节给孩子们派送礼物的虚构人物。</p>
<p>"I live for this time of year," Paisley said. "Ever since we've had children and possibly even before, I kind of go all out."<br/>
佩斯利说：“我盼着每年的这个时候。自从我们有了孩子，甚至可能在此之前，我就有点不遗余力。”</p>

<span class="datetime">10 December 2023</span><br/>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are killed every year by malaria and other diseases that are spread through mosquito bites.</p>
<p>Female mosquitoes are responsible for these deadly bites because they have a special mouth design that male mosquitoes do not have.</p>
<p>But it has not always been that way. Researchers said they have discovered the oldest-known fossils of mosquitoes - two males located in pieces of an ancient orange-colored substance known as amber.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An undated handout image of a view from below of the head of a fossilized male mosquito, including elongated sucking-piercing mouthparts, trapped in amber found in central Lebanon dating to about 130 million years ago.

(Dany Azar/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The male mosquitoes date to 130 million years ago. They were found near the modern town of Hammana in Lebanon. To researchers' surprise, the male mosquitoes had long mouthparts seen now only in females.</p>
<p>Dany Azar is a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology and Lebanese University. Azar said they were clearly blood-eaters. The lead writer of the study, recently published in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01448-3" target="_blank">Current Biology</a>, added, "This discovery is a major one in the <strong>evolutionary</strong> history of mosquitoes."</p>
<p>The two fossilized mosquitoes, both representing the same species that has died off, are similar in size and appearance to modern mosquitoes. However, the mouthparts used for getting blood are shorter than in today's female mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Study co-writer André Nel of the National Museum of Natural History of Paris described the finding as "quite surprising."</p>
<p>The special<strong> anatomy</strong> of the two mosquitoes was beautifully saved in the fossils. Both insects had sharp and triangle-shaped jaw anatomy and a long structure with tooth-like elements.</p>
<p>The researchers said they suspect that mosquitoes evolved from insects that did not consume blood. They think that the mouthparts that were developed for getting blood meals were originally used to <strong>pierce</strong> plants to get nutritious fluids.</p>
<p>Plant evolution may have affected the differences in feeding between male and female mosquitoes. At the time when these two mosquitoes became stuck in tree <strong>sap</strong> that eventually became amber, flowering plants were beginning to spread for the first time.</p>
<p>From the findings, Azar said that all early mosquitoes, both male and female, were bloodsucking. And male mosquitoes lost the ability later.</p>
<p>The researchers said while these are the oldest mosquito fossils, mosquitoes probably appeared millions of years earlier. They noted that molecular evidence suggests mosquitoes developed from about 200 million to 145 million years ago.</p>
<p>There are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes worldwide, found everywhere except Antarctica. Some species spread diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, Zika fever, dengue and others. The World Health Organization says more than 400,000 people die annually from malaria - a parasitic infection - mostly children under age 5.</p>

<p>Scientists have identified six planets orbiting a nearby star "in perfect <strong>harmony</strong>" in our Milky Way galaxy. The solar system appears to be untouched by outside forces since it was created, likely billions of years ago.</p>
<p>The rare discovery was made by observations from a pair of space telescopes – the European Space Agency's Cheops, and Tess, operated by the American space agency NASA. The find is expected to provide astronomers with new data to help them learn more about how solar systems form and develop.</p>
<p>The six planets sit in the northern sky constellation of Coma Berenices, about 100 light-years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration depicts the six planets of the HD110067 system, which scientists say interact perfectly in gravitational synchronization.

<p>The star the planets are orbiting is known as HD110067. It is about 20 percent smaller in mass than our sun. The six planets are about two to three times the size of Earth. But they are believed to have densities closer to gas giants in our own solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>The scientists say the planets are considered "sub-Neptunes." This is a common kind of planet found within our Milky Way galaxy. These planets are generally much larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune.</p>
<p>The orbits range from nine days to 54 days. This puts them closer to their star than Venus is to our sun. It also makes the planets intensely hot. The researchers say that while only six planets were discovered, there could be more.</p>
<p>An international team of astronomers recently described the findings <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06692-3">in a study</a> that appeared in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers reported the six planets were in a rare condition called orbital resonance. This is when two or more moons line up with their parent planet at regular times and <strong>interact</strong> gravitationally. In this case, the team described the solar system as completely "synchronized" in a gravitational formation. Synchronized means happening at the same time and speed.</p>

<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The scientists say it is likely these synchronized orbits have been happening since the system formed about 4 billion years ago. The planets were identified by observing small drops in the star's brightness when a planet passed in front of the star.</p>
<p>Hugh Osborn, of the University of Bern in Switzerland, helped lead the research. He said the resonance interactions demonstrate "the mathematical beauty" of the system. Osborn added that the newly discovered system could possibly "unlock the secrets of these mysterious sub-Neptune planets, which we know so little about."</p>
<p>The lead writer of the study was Rafael Luque. He is an astronomer from the University of Chicago. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/scientists-discover-rare-6-planet-system-moves-strange-synchrony?utm_source=WWW&amp;utm_medium=NewsModule">said</a> the discovery will likely become a very useful tool to study sub-Neptunes.</p>
<p>Scientists have long wondered whether sub-Neptunes might be rocky planets with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have also suggested the planets might be made of rock and ice, with warm and water-rich atmospheres.</p>
<p>Luque said the synchronized nature of the discovered system is highly rare and requires further study. "We think only about one percent of all systems stay in resonance, and even fewer show a <strong>chain</strong> of planets in such <strong>configuration</strong>," he said. "It shows us the <strong>pristine</strong> configuration of a planetary system that has survived untouched."</p>
<p>Enric Palle is a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics in the Canary Islands. He told the Associated Press that while astronomers know of 40 to 50 in-sync solar systems, none have as many planets in such perfect synchronization as the newly discovered one.</p>
<p>The University of Bern's Osborn said he was surprised but pleased when the orbital periods of the planets came close to what scientists predicted. "My <strong>jaw</strong> <strong>was on the floor</strong>," he said. "That was a really nice moment."</p>

            <title>How to Grow Mushrooms Indoors  (2023/12/11)</title>

<p>Mushrooms are not only tasty. They are also filled with healthy nutrients, like calcium and potassium, and vitamins, like D and B.</p>
<p>Some people not only enjoy eating mushrooms. They also like to collect them in the wild. But that is not for everyone. While some people are knowledgeable enough to collect mushrooms in the woods and eat them, many people are not. Eating the wrong mushroom can make you sick or even ... dead.</p>
<p>Therefore, buying them is the easier and safer choice. However, there is another one: You can grow mushrooms yourself inside your own home.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated image provided by North Spore shows a variety of cultivated mushrooms in a cardboard box in Portland, Maine. (North Spore via AP)" src="https://img.51voa.cn/1/01000000-c0a8-0242-048e-08dbf7ee9eb5_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This undated image provided by North Spore shows a variety of cultivated mushrooms in a cardboard box in Portland, Maine.

<p>In a recent article for <em>The Associated Press</em>, plant expert Jessica Damiano explains there are two ways to do this. You can buy a set of materials from a garden store called a "grow kit" or you can put them together yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Grow kits</strong></p>
<p>Grow kits are a great way for beginners to try growing mushrooms. These grow kits include partly-grown mushroom starters, called "spawn." The spawn is set in soil and is contained in its own grow box. You put the spawn in water overnight. Then you return it to the box and open it to fresh air. <strong>Spray</strong> it with water two times a day.</p>
<p>Within two or three weeks, you will be eating mushrooms with more on the way. Damiano says it is a fun, easy activity. And people will likely ask you about it.</p>
<p><strong>Putting them together yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you are more serious about growing mushrooms and want a larger harvest, Damiano says it costs less to put the materials together yourself. It is easy, she says.</p>
<p>For starters, you will need a wooden, metal, or plastic box or container. It needs to be about 15 centimeters deep and large enough to hold your harvest.</p>
<p>You will also need a growing substance -- soil mixed with compost and other materials. The materials depend on the mushrooms. White button mushrooms grow better in a half-and-half mix of compost and <strong>well-rotted manure</strong>. Oyster mushrooms do well in oat or wheat straw. Shiitakes, another kind of mushroom, like sawdust.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need <strong>fungal spores</strong>: Think of them as seeds. You can purchase these online or at specialty stores.</p>
<p>Clean your hands well. Avoid bringing bacteria, <strong>mold,</strong> or non-mushroom fungi into the box. Fill the box with your growing substance (soil and materials) leaving about 25 millimeters at the top. Put the spores evenly over the soil substance and gently wet it. Spray it with water twice daily. Keep it wet but not too wet.</p>
<p>To grow quickly and effectively, the spore-topped soil material should be kept away from direct sunlight. It should be kept at or close to 21 degrees Celsius. If you cannot keep a room in your home at that temperature, set the box or tray on a heating <strong>pad</strong> set to 21 degrees but no higher (warmer temperatures can kill the spores). A soil thermometer can help make sure the soil does not get too warm.</p>
<p>Put a piece of cloth lightly over the top of the box to keep <strong>moisture </strong>in. But do not seal it tightly.</p>
<p>Soon, a white coating will form on the surface of the soil. That is mycelium, a network of fungal threads from which your mushrooms will grow.</p>
<p>When the soil is completely coated with mycelium, top it off with a bit more of the soil mixture. Remove any heating elements. And move the tray to a cooler spot – 12 to 15 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Mushrooms usually grow, or "fruit," within a week or two. They nearly double in size daily until they are finished growing. Depending on the kind of mushroom, they will be ready to harvest, with their tops fully open. That will be in roughly three to four weeks. Use a sharp, clean knife to cut them at soil level to avoid disrupting nearby growth.</p>

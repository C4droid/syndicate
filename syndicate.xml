<p data-line-id="cfce23fa8eb544e881748044bd75a2cf"> WASHINGTON, DC/BERKELEY/KYIV – On his recent visit to the United States, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/xi-jinping-hosted-by-u-s-business-leaders/">encouraged American companies</a> to regard his country as a close trading partner. In fact, US companies should be seeking to move their supply chains and other business away from China – while they still have the time. Through its deliberate and repeated actions, China is heading for an economic showdown with the US. </p>
<p data-line-id="ec708cf666db4671aef2d06c8502fbb9"> For many decades, Western governments have pursued versions of what Germans call <em>Wandel durch Handel</em><em> </em>(change through trade), hoping to achieve global stability, reduce international confrontation, and (perhaps) promote more democracy through economic interaction with authoritarian regimes. The idea is simple: countries that trade extensively with each other will not jeopardize the resulting profits and jobs by going to war; prosperity and interdependence mitigate aggression. </p>
<p data-line-id="73c48a38591645bca395a83256ffe894"> In the post-World War II era, this strategy has sometimes worked astonishingly well. The establishment of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/European-Coal-and-Steel-Community#:~:text=European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community%20(ECSC)%2C%20administrative%20agency%20established,%2C%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20and%20Luxembourg.">European Coal and Steel Community</a> in 1952 took the key inputs for weapons production out of the hands of national governments and <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/history-eu/1945-59_en">led to the European Union</a> today. Germany and France (and later other Western European countries) became tightly linked by mutual trade and investment, so that war between any of them would impose an unbearable cost on victim and aggressor alike. Western Europe, a region that for centuries had been the most prone to interstate violence (often with disastrous global spillovers), became a bastion of peace. </p>
<p data-line-id="2b090f8bd3854ddc8ed5ff0235754292"> But <em>Wandel durch Handel</em> is far from being a sure bet, because it depends crucially on initial institutional conditions and the strength of ideologies. And today’s world contains several prominent and extremely dangerous examples of where expanded trade has gone badly wrong, from a democratic perspective. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is the most spectacular example. </p>
<p data-line-id="760ee4da699748f99d781d766399ed75"> After the collapse of communist rule in 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s administration was given much economic aid and invited to the club of leading democratic countries: the G7 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Group-of-Eight">became the G8</a>. But once Russia became richer in the mid-2000s, owing to a rise in oil prices, the rhetoric of its <a href="https://texty.org.ua/projects/109726/putins-paranoia/">leaders</a> and the tenor of its <a href="https://www.levada.ru/indikatory/otnoshenie-k-stranam/">public opinion</a> turned sharply against the West, and former Soviet republics whose independence had been internationally recognized for a generation were treated as “<a href="https://capx.co/no-boris-the-west-didnt-lose-russia/">not real countries</a>.” </p>
<p data-line-id="bec90e17f1484fceb7c165f48e482e00"> Eventually, bellicose rhetoric turned into military aggression. But, after invading Georgia in 2008, Russia did not face sweeping sanctions and isolation. Instead, it got a “<a href="https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1971651,00.html">reset</a>” with the US and even more power in the EU energy market. In 2015, then-Vice President Joe Biden <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/07/remarks-vice-president-munich-security-conference">explained</a> the US administration’s reasoning: “All of us, we all invested in a type of Russia we hoped – and still hope – will emerge one day: a Russia integrated into the world economy; more prosperous, more invested in the international order.” </p>
<p data-line-id="00068e1b63f44f59b2f5a9fadfd51c2d"> The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west">Nord Stream gas pipeline</a> linking Russia and Germany, for example, was a classic case of <em>Wandel durch Handel</em>. Although the precise mix of strategic and commercial motives was not <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/09/angela-merkel-german-chancellor-europe-trade-euro-refugees-crisis/">clear</a>, the net result of this approach is a dangerous tyrant with deep pockets, able and willing to fire a lot of missiles at innocent civilians in a neighboring country. </p>
<p data-line-id="0303f260a65645e7a2846e5b62188ea2"> Standing behind Russian President Vladimir Putin is Xi. China is apparently ready to sell Russia anything and everything it wants, including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-it-is-finding-more-chinese-components-russian-weapons-2023-04-14/">missile components</a>. Western sanctions are far from perfect, but China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/how-us-microchips-are-fueling-russias-military-despite-sanctions.html">greatly facilitates</a> the flow of goods into Russia. China could put decisive pressure on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine, just as it could push Iran not to support terrorists. But it does no such thing, because <em>Wandel durch Handel</em> has failed spectacularly with regard to China, too. </p>
<p data-line-id="25698df719a042c09b59953dea777d74"> Since the 1990s, Western companies have invested a fortune in the Chinese economy, and tens of thousands of Chinese students have studied in US and European universities or worked in Western companies. None of this made China more democratic. On the contrary, over the past decade, Xi has rapidly moved China <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/what-xi-jinpings-third-term-means-for-the-world/">toward totalitarianism</a>, eliminating even those rudimentary <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/china-in-xis-new-era-the-return-to-personalistic-rule/">checks and balances</a> implemented after the death of Mao Zedong. It is ironic and appalling that China uses Western technologies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/technology/china-surveillance-police.html">suppress dissent</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/12/7/why-are-countries-banning-huawei">spy on Western countries</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/misinformation/tiktok-is-a-misinformation-minefield-dont-get-tripped-up/">spread disinformation</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d63d26e83484e73a80e4577b655ae74"> Even worse, the trade between democracies and autocracies in recent decades seems to have made democracies more dependent on autocracies, rather than vice versa. This was obvious from democracies’ reaction to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The EU was very reluctant to stop buying Russian energy and paid Russia <a href="https://re-russia.net/en/review/232/">€140 billion</a> ($152 billion) between March 2022 and March 2023; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230918-business-in-russia-why-some-firms-havent-left">hundreds of Western companies remain in Russia</a> and thus help finance the war (through their tax payments and in other ways). </p>
<p data-line-id="d8c2f85fd891475eaf92775716aa2edd"> The US bought goods worth <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/country-papers/3268-2022-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-china/file">$536.8 billion</a> directly from China in 2022 (plus services worth another <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china#:~:text=U.S.%20imports%20of%20services%20from,percent%20greater%20than%202012%20levels.">$27 billion</a>) – nearly one-sixth of total US goods imports of $3.3 trillion. According to the US Trade Representative, American direct foreign investment in China is valued at <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china#:~:text=U.S.%20foreign%20direct%20investment%20(FDI,trade%2C%20and%20finance%20and%20insurance.">$126 billion</a>. All this trade and investment served a decades-long good-faith effort to strengthen bilateral relations. But a lucrative commercial strategy was also a failed foreign policy. </p>
<p data-line-id="47ced448942040bb8b4625686ec7d901"> There is a growing bipartisan consensus in Washington that sourcing from geopolitical friends and reshoring production to the US are urgently needed to correct externalities that markets themselves cannot fix. Other much-needed policies include accelerated promotion of green technologies, to make the world less dependent on terrorist regimes for fossil fuels, and prohibiting politicians, educational institutions, think tanks and media from receiving money (and influence) originating in countries with antagonistic regimes. </p>
<p data-line-id="20b541e797aa4c22ab8e68c0f037d8bb"> Whatever happens in the next US election cycle, expect further sanctions and myriad other restrictions on trade with China. Unless the Chinese leadership changes course radically, a major trade war will become increasingly likely. The writing is on the wall: US investors should diversify their suppliers as soon as possible. </p>

<p data-line-id="574e1c4da445425582eb9d92fe2579bd"> CAMBRIDGE – Ten years ago, Eugene Fama and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/robert-j-shiller">Robert J. Shiller</a> were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2013/press-release/">Nobel Prize in Economics</a> (together with Lars Peter Hansen) “for their empirical analysis of asset prices.” Fama and Shiller, however, hold diametrically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/business/3-american-professors-awarded-nobel-in-economic-sciences.html">opposing views</a> on asset-price movements, from what drives the decisions of economic actors to whether markets are inherently efficient. Fifteen years after the global economic crisis, it is a disagreement worth revisiting. </p><p data-line-id="0a2ba7b660ed4273ba211ac1e9f5d6cb"> Fama is a member of the Chicago School of economics, both literally – he is a professor at the Booth School of Business – and intellectually. The Chicago School holds that economic actors are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/12/why-do-econ-classes-barely-mention-behavioral-economics/578092/">rational utility-maximizing agents</a>, able to deploy infinite cognitive capacity and complete information at all times, in order to make decisions that will best serve their material interests. With his highly influential “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486">efficient market hypothesis</a>,” Fama takes this further, positing that prices almost immediately incorporate all available information about future values, and thus accurately reflect economic fundamentals. </p><p data-line-id="e0473c27a0064042a5446380982d5b8f"> Shiller, a Yale-based behavioral economist, could not disagree more. Taking a Keynesian view of markets, he argues that, in markets shaped by “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691145921/animal-spirits">animal spirits</a>,” individual actors have irrational tendencies, which can be amplified by the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182292/narrative-economics">collective mood</a> of the market. This sometimes results in irrational and suboptimal outcomes, such as speculative asset bubbles. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4c8bec3b78e424c82f602f581edf3a6"> BEIJING – For millennia, natural infrastructure – such as river systems, wetlands, coastal plains, sand dunes, and forests – supported the development of human civilization. In fact, our ability to harness such infrastructure, for everything from food and drinking water to storm-surge protection and flood mitigation, has been central to our success as a species. And it will prove vital to our future survival. </p>
<p data-line-id="b6adf9002f674db9bb4c7d266dc47038"> Technological advances propelled the evolution of infrastructure. Green turned to grey, with concrete, cable, and steel delivering energy, communications, and transportation – and, with them, unprecedented growth and development. But while rapid modernization produced once-unimaginable prosperity, it has had grave unintended consequences, not least the environmental degradation and greenhouse-gas emissions that are jeopardizing our very existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="fa874c80706a4e2f93b05190b6fc52cb"> The question now is how to meet urgent environmental goals – reducing emissions and protecting and restoring nature and biodiversity – while enabling developing economies to fulfill their legitimate growth aspirations. The answer, as a recent <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">report</a> from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank suggests, may well begin with an explicit acknowledgement of nature as infrastructure. </p>
<p data-line-id="623b2c6a4459462ab4d5d2c064cfc631"> Viewing nature as infrastructure is transformative, because it forces us to think in a more systemic way. As we pursue growth and development, we must not only avoid damaging nature; we must also strengthen and enrich it through “nature-positive” investments – all while tapping its vast potential to deliver essential services. </p>
<p data-line-id="3bf1110a2e494b6bba469a67b702d695"> Biologists already do this when they benchmark how to restore degraded land. But now economists must get on board and enhance their tools for capturing the value and complexity of natural capital. Biodiversity, for example, covers not just the number of species, but also their genetic diversity and diversity of functions. Yet another dimension of biodiversity is the complex evolutionary history of species – when they were separated on the “tree of life.” It is only by deepening our understanding of biodiversity that we will comprehend nature’s full potential – and our impact on it. </p>
<p data-line-id="84188ef77a7e44948488c278c5695b11"> This knowledge is very site-specific, and acquiring it will require contributions from scientists and local populations. The good news is that there are already models for such collaboration. The massive <a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/a/146836">Sanbei reforestation project</a>, aimed at preventing two large deserts from merging in Northern China, was a flawed endeavor at the start, with only single tree types planted. But, over the course of two decades, deeper knowledge of the local environment and the participation of local communities transformed it into a success. </p>
<p data-line-id="5ce562e746314c7b9569bdb7dbbdea06"> Governance and incentives are also crucial to protect and nurture natural infrastructure. In Indonesia, <a href="https://en.nabu.de/topics/ecosystems/mangrove-conservation-sulawesi.html">mangroves</a> have long protected communities, particularly poorer households, from deadly tidal floods, but they are being <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/mangrove-loss-threatens-community-resilience">depleted</a> in regions with weaker state capacity. In Egypt, by contrast, efforts to restore mangroves have been aided by <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2020-12/13/c_139586420.htm">revenues</a> from eco-tourism and beekeeping, which produces honey and supports the delivery of vital pollination services. </p>
<p data-line-id="62775e698f354ad7a02c1f8475ab14f7"> The nature-as-infrastructure approach demands that we assess what nature can deliver before considering grey solutions, and it can help countries close their infrastructure gaps in truly sustainable ways. But grey infrastructure will always be necessary for growth and development. This demands that we design it better, to minimize its impact on nature. For example, renewable-energy infrastructure has a large <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">ecological footprint</a>, and road infrastructure fragments and damages ecosystems. Solutions like <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">co-locating</a> infrastructure on brown sites and providing auxiliary infrastructure (such as wildlife highway crossings, green urban spaces, and nature-restoration offsets) can help mitigate these effects. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d801ad304f34e6287ef8632353494e6"> Of course, financing might pose a challenge. The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a>, agreed a year ago, assumes that <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">$598-824 billion per year</a> will be needed by 2030 to close the biodiversity funding gap. Such sums, needed to protect and then begin to restore nature, can be generated only by valuing nature properly and creating markets that will mobilize private and institutional capital. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c6f1aa3b8f84575b83341f060d7f800"> To this end, “nature as infrastructure” must be developed as an asset class, using new tools and financial instruments. At the micro level, this will require better pricing of nature’s services – for example, usage charges or permits and taxes for damaging activities – and adaptive local regulations. Micro-level policies can support the development of other financial instruments and, eventually, markets – for performance-linked bonds, policy-based lending, debt-for-nature swaps, and nature credits, to name a few – to channel more finance into nature. Lessons from carbon markets should be heeded, to avoid repeating past mistakes. </p>
<p data-line-id="b754ddcca33a49ccb82aa4b73840680b"> Special attention must be paid to low-income economies, many of which are highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation but have rich natural endowments that should be valued properly. Multilateral development banks can catalyze the nature-as-infrastructure approach, ensuring that it is incorporated into all aspects of their operations. Ultimately, this approach should also guide individual infrastructure projects and national growth strategies. </p>
<p data-line-id="92c8215a6a52477d98df30a91f31ecf3"> The consequences of the infrastructure decisions we make today will be felt for decades to come. Only by committing to invest in green – and to build grey better – can we ensure we lay the groundwork for a fairer, more sustainable, and inclusive global economy. </p>

He is right. Unless we act decisively – beginning at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) underway in Dubai – the threat that climate change poses to humanity will become nothing short of existential. </p><p data-line-id="ed56d81a8e4b4efd9c058010ec2c63f1"> Already, climate change is a major risk multiplier for conflict and instability. Extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves have led to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/environment-disasters-and-climate-change/climate-change-and">forcible displacement</a> of more than 20 million people each year since 2008.

Of the 20 countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, <a href="https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/topic/file_plus_list/rain_turns_to_dust_climate_change_conflict.pdf">12 are mired in conflicts</a>. Authoritarian countries are taking advantage of the turmoil, attempting to gain influence over fragile governments and secure access to raw materials. Unless our mitigation and adaptation efforts are equal to the climate crisis, these trends will accelerate and spread, with truly catastrophic results. </p>

<p data-line-id="f8d15fe7d3f64a6d8e3f5e3cf6317739"> AUSTIN – In a recent <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dcc702cb-0eec-4ac8-a0b8-c911a0b4f180">commentary</a> for the <em>Financial Times</em>, Martin Wolf trots out the specter of a “public-debt disaster,” that recurrent <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/debt-ceiling-yellen-spending-cuts/">staple</a> of bond-market chatter. The essence of his argument is that since debt-to-GDP ratios are high, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26f17a3f-2f64-45df-aff2-d0476dd53d42">eminent authorities</a> are alarmed, “fiscal crises” in the form of debt defaults or inflation “loom.” And that means something must be done<em>.</em></p><p data-line-id="1b05bbbaac4245ab82c30c1c692e4ab8"> While Wolf does not say explicitly what that something is, “painful fiscal choices seem to lie ahead.” Cue the chorus calling for <a href="https://www.crfb.org/issue-area/social-security">cuts</a> to Social Security and Medicare in the United States, and to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. </p><p data-line-id="6210e3a71577417fb61e166b84e6ee3b"> To bolster his argument, Wolf revisits an equation relating real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates, real growth rates, the “primary” budget deficit or surplus (net of interest payments on public debt), and the debt-to-GDP ratio. It is a familiar device, first offered up in a 1980s working paper by <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/olivier-blanchard">Olivier Blanchard</a>, then at MIT. I <a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/is-the-federal-debt-unsustainable">analyzed it in depth</a> for the Levy Economics Institute in 2011, and Blanchard recently revisited it <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/if-markets-are-right-about-long-real-rates-public-debt-ratios-will">for his blog</a>, with this conclusion: “If markets are right about long real rates, public debt ratios will increase for some time. We must make sure that they do not explode.” </p>

<p data-line-id="ade8def2233f472ea46243514fdf2532"> BERKELEY – When political leaders, policymakers, environmental advocates, and philanthropists gather for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28), food systems will be high on the agenda for the first time. Given that the food sector accounts for <a href="https://www.unido.org/stories/new-research-shows-food-system-responsible-third-global-anthropogenic-emissions">one-third</a> of all greenhouse-gas emissions, its inclusion is long overdue. </p>
<p data-line-id="def282215cb445389a6ec947c3b918b3"> But this welcome breakthrough risks being offset by the fact that COP28 is hosted by a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/petrostates-must-lead-cop28-with-global-south-investment-pledge-by-ban-ki-moon-et-al-2023-11">petrostate</a>, and presided over by the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11?a_la=english&amp;a_d=655e0b2078584c0b7cf797f6&amp;a_m=&amp;a_a=click&amp;a_s=&amp;a_p=%2Ftopic%2Fmaking-cop28-count&amp;a_li=cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11&amp;a_pa=topic-commentaries&amp;a_ps=main-article-a2&amp;a_ms=&amp;a_r=">leader</a> of that petrostate’s oil company. This is particularly concerning since averting catastrophic climate scenarios requires that we phase out fossil fuels and transform food systems with equal urgency. </p>
<p data-line-id="998ad11646b34ec987be6036b462ff4c"> Fortunately, these two challenges need not compete for our attention, because transforming food systems is also a powerful way to reduce our global dependency on fossil fuels. As our organization shows in a new <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/#:~:text=and%20Frameworks%2C%20Environment-,Power%20Shift%3A%20Why%20we%20need%20to%20wean,food%20systems%20off%20fossil%20fuels&amp;text=Our%20new%20research%20shows%20that,fossil%20fuel%20emissions%20every%20year.">report</a>, <em>Power Shift: Why We Need to Wean Our Industrial Food Systems Off Fossil Fuels</em>, food systems, from farm to plate to landfill, account for at least 15% of annual global fossil-fuel use – equal to that of the European Union and Russia combined. And if the current approach to industrial food production continues, that figure is expected to increase significantly. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c8d5fed45534e37b539d733a514972f"> Today’s industrial food system is increasingly fossil fuel-intensive. Fossil fuels go into synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the plastics that are used in everything from the coatings for those pesticides and fertilizers to most food packaging. Moreover, most packaging is needed to store ultra-processed foods – from meat and dairy to sweets and sugary drinks – all of which require highly energy-intensive manufacturing and petrochemicals in the form of plastics. </p>
<p data-line-id="457115f297484bdc904e6f33cd9adca5"> Worryingly, the energy sector views the food system as a promising growth market. Food-related plastics and synthetic fertilizers account for approximately <a href="https://story.futureoffood.org/power-shift/">40%</a> of all petrochemical products, and the International Energy Agency <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/bee4ef3a-8876-4566-98cf-7a130c013805/The_Future_of_Petrochemicals.pdf">predicts</a> that petrochemicals will drive nearly half the growth in oil demand by 2050, outstripping sectors like aviation and shipping. Similarly, research from the Center for International Environmental Law has shown that fossil-fuel companies are banking on the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fossils-Fertilizers-and-False-Solutions.pdf">expansion</a> of these markets.<strong> </strong>The industry “is eyeing the food system,” CIEL’s Lisa Tostado told us, “from inputs like pesticides and fertilizers to production and processing, as a dangerous escape hatch.” </p>
<p data-line-id="52a2321b0ff54ffa9a60dd40a0610ef7"> Finally, we’re also seeing a push to use more agricultural land for incredibly inefficient energy production. The United States already dedicates about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=105761">40%</a> of its corn harvest to ethanol fuels, which are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/">estimated</a> to be “at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline.” </p>
<p data-line-id="291a9269bc8f4a1d960d9ca940bd359c"> Given increased marketing of and demand for energy-intensive food, decoupling food production from fossil fuels is essential to meet our climate goals. Even if all governments delivered on their 2030 climate pledges, <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/">fossil-fuel use</a> in the food system alone would consume our remaining 1.5° Celsius carbon budget by 2037. </p>
<p data-line-id="32dba9075718414fa8533d31b574a168"> Fortunately, there are many ways to phase out fossil fuels in food systems. These include strategies to end the use of fossil-fuel-based fertilizers and pesticides, and to move away from input-dependent crop-based energy systems like corn ethanol; shifting to renewable energy for processing, cooling, and drying food; supporting minimally processed, less energy-intensive foods and encouraging plant-rich diets; and encouraging the uptake of seasonal, locally grown food. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc2e2c285b142c887ef9f2312832fa2"> Shifting away from industrial methods toward more sustainable ways of farming not only would protect the planet. It also would create jobs, improve health, protect biodiversity, and help address the roots of hunger. Evidence from around the world <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apcnf-tca-study_2023.pdf">shows</a> that approaches like agroecology and regenerative agriculture are effective in driving a shift away from fossil-fuel dependency. With these strategies, yields remain steady or improve, while emissions fall, farmworkers’ health improves, and biodiversity is protected. </p>
<p data-line-id="9ce6951f61014c40b15b25f2f05c01a1"> There is no technical barrier to shifting from dependence on synthetic inputs toward agroecological and regenerative food production, or to replacing fossil-fuel energy with renewable sources. But many governments offer very few subsidies to support these transitions, and many more incentivize business as usual. According to the OECD, every year between 2019 and 2021, public funds totaling <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/climatefinancereport-english.pdf">$528 billion</a> were channeled to agricultural and food-production practices that are generally bad for the climate, the environment, and human health. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a5d5b1c723e42f0a2c3abb0a34da506"> Now that we have come to understand just how endemic fossil-fuel usage is across our economies, we must take pains to ensure that <em>all</em> sectors are included in the transition to a fossil-fuel-free future. Despite COP28’s dubious staging in a petrostate, we are pleased to see food finally taking center stage. But that discussion must not be isolated from the one about ending the use of fossil fuels as fast as possible. There will be no food-systems transformation without phasing out fossil fuels, and there will be no phasing out fossil fuels without food-systems transformation. </p>

<p data-line-id="92c9be40e4bc4f4aa5fa9e040e411ba8"> LONDON – Nearly 30 years into global negotiations to address climate change, efforts to control the problem are lagging, reflecting stalled progress toward creating a sustainable trajectory more broadly. Each year of delay adds to the urgency of the problem, and of the need to maintain Earth’s resilience against the most severe effects of global warming. </p><p data-line-id="e17e191e2aa14631bd0673a1432ff5e9"> It has been 17 years since the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/the-economics-of-climate-change-the-stern-review/">Stern Review</a> alerted the world to the costs of inaction on climate change, and two years since the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review">Dasgupta Review</a> did the same for biodiversity and the ecological underpinnings of our economies. Now, a similar expert <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-water-crisis-new-economics-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2023-03">consensus</a> is emerging around water security. But most countries still do not seem to understand that neglecting water could undo the progress made on other fronts. We are facing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00800-z">global water crisis</a> that warrants the same level of attention, ambition, and action as the climate and biodiversity crises. </p><p data-line-id="d4a309acc5c049d1a240ec5b5b9ea9c7"> The links between the climate, biodiversity, and water crises point to a fundamental issue: our economies are based on flawed economics. Current economic thinking leads us to consider only the proceeds of pillaging of the planet, while ignoring externalities such as environmental damage and the liabilities they imply. This bad accounting makes us look wealthier when we are actually becoming poorer, depleting the sources of our well-being at the cost of future generations. </p>

<p data-line-id="3536dc9c23fe447caefa65e177bbf698"> DUBAI – Nation-states, presidents, and prime ministers – those are the players who garner the biggest headlines and the most media attention at each year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference. Yet for the past decade, and with far less fanfare, cities, states, and regional governments (known as “subnationals”) have been implementing the Paris climate agreement’s guidance, even when their national governments have not. This has meant investing in clean-energy systems and other urban innovations to reduce emissions locally, and sharing what works through networks like <a href="https://www.c40.org/about-c40/">C40</a> and the <a href="https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/">Global Covenant of Mayors</a> to accelerate progress on a larger scale. </p>
<p data-line-id="c566c5a192d945ff965fd1554ed2b719"> Fortunately, this year’s UN conference in Dubai (<a href="https://www.cop28.com/">COP28</a>) brings a historic first that bodes well for progress on climate change more broadly. The inaugural <a href="https://www.cop28.com/LCAS">Local Climate Action Summit</a> will bring mayors and governors together to engage directly with national and international leaders, demonstrating how cities are driving solutions and generating ideas that are being adopted around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="bc8073bdc63049fb8a7b1cfd9887c34c"> The timing for this breakthrough couldn’t be better. The UN recently released its <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/implementation-must-accelerate-to-increase-ambition-across-all-fronts-taking-an-all-of-society">first official report card</a> on the progress the world has made since COP15 in Paris. It shows that bolder and more urgent action is needed to hold global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the limit required to stave off the worst effects of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="32f38b51e50b42e2a4cfce50e95e2c39"> Cities like Freetown, which is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change (from extreme heat that rarely subsides to floods and landslides that come without warning), are determined to push world leaders to raise their ambitions – and to empower cities to do more to lead the way. </p>
<p data-line-id="6ec7243d38aa4605a0595d9a6806c43c"> Freetown has shown how cities can set an example through innovative action. When urbanization wiped out 70% of its trees, the city created a <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/winners-finalists/freetown-the-treetown/">program</a> to enlist residents in restoring green cover, which reduces the impact of severe heat. Freetown’s <a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C40_GYMF_Report4.pdf">young people</a> are a big part of the campaign to plant one million trees by 2024, and their engagement does not stop there. Young people are well represented on Freetown’s Community <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2011/en/bgdocs/hfa/16241_sle_NationalHFAprogress_2009-11.pdf">Disaster Management Committees</a> and have put their collective energy into the city’s Transform Freetown Agenda (of which the tree-planting is part). </p>
<p data-line-id="82918b710c8647b383e6f938ffad6e36"> Nor is Freetown alone. In the Philippines, Quezon City has created a network of <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-quezon-city/">sustainable urban gardens and farms</a> that addresses food insecurity among residents and reduces the emissions associated with traditional farming. In Lima, Peru, civic leaders have developed a <a href="https://interlace-hub.com/local-climate-change-plan-province-lima-peru#:~:text=The%20Local%20Climate%20Change%20Plan,prosperous,%20inclusive%20and%20resilient%20city.">climate-change plan</a> that not only aims to protect the area’s ecosystems, but also targets the small changes – park by park, orchard by orchard – that add up to large-scale improvements in the urban landscape. It has also launched a <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-lima/">highly successful effort</a> to monitor and improve air quality where the city’s children play, learn, and live. </p>
<p data-line-id="ec8f1649e10847ff887e36632efee37d"> In these and many other ways, cities are showing global leaders how real progress is made. But cities should not be seen only as models; they also should be treated as essential partners in the global effort to combat climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="2d06da3f1db44797b05fd9d200216f85"> This has not typically been the case. Even where national leaders have professed their belief in multilevel governance, policy frameworks are often indifferent to local and regional climate efforts, which leads them to overlook proven solutions. At COP28 and in the years ahead, local leaders should have an equal voice in the discussion and access to the resources they need to take decisive action. </p>
<p data-line-id="bb0ccd054efb4ffa9522ce4e285b4c2b"> A true partnership between national and subnational governments could be the key that unlocks a consistent flow of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-view-from-freetown-sierra-leone/">climate financing</a>. By working together, local and national leaders can exert considerably greater influence on global institutions, including the UN, multilateral development banks, and governments with the means to accelerate climate-finance solutions. </p>
<p data-line-id="e58d8ac77d6f4b18b0a3c475ef9eea1b"> The world’s mayors are increasingly coming together to deliver this message with a unified voice. Hence, in advance of the COP28 Local Climate Action Summit, C40 modernized its leadership model to include two, rather than just one, chair. The network is now co-chaired by the mayors of London and Freetown, an arrangement that better represents the insights and experiences of the world’s people. </p>
<p data-line-id="00b6eddb9f58426aa715ade5a7148ad2"> COP28 provides an opportunity to build on the leadership of London Mayor <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sadiq-khan">Sadiq Khan</a>, who, in his previous role as C40 Chair, helped ensure that <a href="https://www.c40.org/news/c40-announces-co-chair-model-london-freetown-mayors/#:~:text=As%20chair%20of%20C40%2C%20Sadiq,Air%20Fund%2C%20and%20C40%20Cities.">two-thirds</a> of the organization’s budget is dedicated to advancing climate action in the Global South, where the effects of climate are the most severe. </p>
<p data-line-id="7f096dcc65f94048b44cfd42162bcc7c"> Local leaders around the world are proving that when we join our strengths, pool our resources, and come together in a genuine spirit of partnership, local and national governments can achieve great progress and help safeguard the future. </p>

<p data-line-id="ef2070d81add4e2f9dfd00b8de8ce517"> STANFORD – Economists and policymakers agree that technological improvements are crucial to economic growth. The information technology (IT) revolution of the last four decades has driven the economy forward, and very few people would want to stop it. But since the 1980s, as that revolution has taken root, the US economy has experienced a sharp rise in firms’ market power, defined predominantly as their ability to affect pricing. </p><p data-line-id="d46ff412e40d4b9fa6e0f41f600d281a"> Rising productivity and rising market power are the twin outcomes of the innovation process. Both result from the private ownership of technology, and from the legal powers conferred by patents or trade secrets. When an innovation wave like the IT revolution takes off, market power rapidly accumulates and becomes a significant force, with profound economic and political implications. In my recent <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-market-power-of-technology/9780231206532">book</a>, I call this unique force the “<em>market power of technology</em>.” </p><p data-line-id="f57897beeae04ff4af31ecb731e9afa2"> Although economists have long recognized the dangers of such market power, the universal view has been that it is short-lived because competition will erode it, patents will expire, and trade secrets cannot be kept secret for long. Allowing innovators some market power thus has been considered a small price to pay for the great benefits of rising productivity. </p>

<p data-line-id="ff3bce6bfa20448aaf8efffa375cae35"> WARSAW – In October, Polish voters demonstrated that even extremely unequal elections against authoritarian incumbents can be won. The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-election-results-opposition-donald-tusk-wins-final-count-civic-platform-pis/">opposition’s victory</a>, and the country’s subsequent re-democratization, may hold useful lessons for likeminded forces in Hungary, Turkey, and elsewhere. </p><p data-line-id="23974fb2a3a54262b0c2930f2ee7e739"> In Poland, the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/polish-election-jaroslaw-kaczynski-defeated-lessons-for-democracy-by-jacek-rostowski-2023-11">defeated populist leader</a>, Jarosław Kaczyński of Law and Justice (PiS), is relearning the rules of democracy the hard way in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-president-swear-govt-opposition-condemns-farce-2023-11-27/">newly elected parliament</a>. For the past eight years, he did not entertain questions in the Sejm (the lower house of parliament) or elsewhere, nor did he engage with any media outlet that PiS did not control. The speaker of the Sejm, Elżbieta Witek, politely followed his instructions and even <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/04/07/polish-government-pushes-through-bill-allowing-may-elections-to-be-held-by-post/">reversed</a> votes that PiS had lost.

Press passes for journalists covering parliament were <a href="https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2016/12/18/polish-government-plans-to-restrict-journalists-access-to-parliament/">strictly limited</a>, and Kaczyński always entered through the speaker’s private entrance. </p>

<p data-line-id="bc847938ff0847a3ada5210706aceb3e"> NEW YORK – It is difficult to imagine the world without Henry Kissinger, not simply because he lived to be 100 years old, but because he occupied an influential – and sometimes dominant – place in American foreign policy and international relations for more than half a century. </p><p data-line-id="a6950d1fa1cc42cca05aa47f08c2af79"> Born in Germany in 1923, Kissinger immigrated to the United States in 1938, returned to Germany while in the US army, and then was a student and later a faculty member at Harvard University. He served for eight years in the US government, first as national security adviser, and then as secretary of state (holding both roles simultaneously between 1973 and 1975) under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. </p><p data-line-id="d82ec388a438443b88f123746d9e8616"> His accomplishments in office were many and substantial. For starters, there was the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/china/china-kissinger-tributes-old-friend-intl-hnk/index.html">opening to China</a>, an opportunity created by the Sino-Soviet split, but discerned and then exploited by Kissinger and Nixon to exert leverage over the Soviet Union (America’s principal adversary at the time). That diplomatic overture not only ended decades of hostility between the US and China. It also produced a formula for finessing differences over Taiwan, laid the foundation for China’s economic transformation, and established an enduring and ever-more important relationship. </p>

<p data-line-id="0838026307304732b06fab3a0ea92bbc"> BEIJING – In the two decades since China’s State Council officially classified the real-estate sector as a “<a href="https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-019-0101-5">pillar industry</a>,” the sector has undergone rapid development, propelling GDP growth and inspiring in millions of Chinese the dream of owning their own home. But the sector is now plagued by problems, from high prices to massive debts, and threatens to undermine growth at a time when China can ill afford it. </p><p data-line-id="350d1ffeb8994315a5ba49dc9dd76667"> Though there is no <a href="https://resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com/en/resources/global-corporate-real-estate-guide/asia-pacific/china/topics/real-estate-law#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20private%20%E2%80%9Cfreehold,to%20as%20%E2%80%9Ccollective%20land.%E2%80%9D">private land ownership</a> in China, households are eager to own their own homes, both to improve their living conditions and to accumulate wealth. Chinese cannot easily purchase foreign assets, owing to capital controls, and Chinese <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9c864c1-6cd4-405e-aa4b-d0b5e2ec6535">stock exchanges</a> have not been performing strongly. China does not tax residential real estate, capital gains, or inheritance – and promises major gains in value. As a result, property becomes the most attractive asset form to own. </p><p data-line-id="b554f63ef5c24034af1ceaad622e2616"> From 2005 to 2021, the real price index for residential property in China <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QCNR628BIS">increased by 28.5%</a>, from 87.95 to 112.99. While the price index has fallen a few times over the years, it has always rebounded strongly, giving Chinese the impression that, when it comes to wealth accumulation, home ownership is practically a sure thing. </p>

<p data-line-id="128d83d7d9184cdc94c1b1c2ee471b1c"> LJUBLJANA – “We must separate the Jews into two categories, the Zionists and the partisans of assimilation,” <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/NTx4AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyh7q0xuSCAxVhhf0HHdUxAT4Qre8FegQIHhAG">wrote</a> Reinhard Heydrich, one of the architects of the Holocaust, in 1935. “The Zionists profess a strictly racial concept and, through emigration to Palestine, they help to build their own Jewish State.…[O]ur good wishes and our official goodwill go with them.”  </p><p data-line-id="5d58a19d10e44f7ea1e41b2f7664b7d8"> In Heydrich’s terms, the creation of the State of Israel thus represented the triumph of Zionism over assimilationism. But it also complicated the traditional anti-Semitic perception of Jews as a deracinated, rootless people. This was Martin Heidegger’s <a href="https://www.klostermann.de/Heidegger-Martin-Ueberlegungen-XII-XV-Schwarze-Hefte-19391941">view</a>, in 1939, when he called for an examination of “Jewry’s predisposition to planetary criminality”: </p><p data-line-id="141395d1b51649b5b32b19b9013b6dfd"> “With their marked gift for calculation, the Jews ‘live’ according to the principle of race, and indeed have done so for the longest time, for which reason they themselves most vigorously resist its unrestricted application. The arrangement of racial breeding stems not from ‘life’ itself, but from the hyperempowerment of life by machination (<em>Machenschaft</em>). What this brings about with such planning is a <em>complete deracination</em> of peoples by harnessing them in a uniformly constructed and streamlined arrangement of all entities. Along with deracination goes a self-alienation of peoples – the loss of history – i.e., of the regions of decision for being (<em>Seyn</em>).” </p>

<p data-line-id="400be51d5af24e1cbf2cb56d3e751297"> NEW DELHI – Imagine a scenario where a private company effectively creates and controls its own jurisdiction within a sovereign country. This company introduces its own currency, enacts laws, and establishes courts, prisons, police forces, and even intelligence services. It formulates its own tax, labor, and environmental regulations (or lack thereof), regardless of their compatibility with national laws. </p><p data-line-id="e5b493b7e74742a9a450bcd14e4a0a75"> Now imagine that this company adopts bitcoin as its official currency and announces plans to privatize public services. It replaces the existing judicial system with an “arbitration center” and even introduces a fee-based citizenship model that requires signing a “social contract” designed to encourage good behavior. Eventually, the country’s democratically elected government steps in to stop this nonsense and affirm that national laws apply equally to this jurisdiction. But instead of complying, the company sues the government for billions of dollars, citing its projected financial losses. </p><p data-line-id="6b64160b003c433cabbf8b64d9c5c0b2"> This scenario, seemingly lifted straight out of a dystopian novel, is precisely what is happening today in Honduras. The Honduran government is currently contending with <a href="https://act.progressive.international/honduras/">seven international investor-state dispute settlement</a> (ISDS) claims filed by various private corporations. One US company based in Delaware, <a href="https://www.corpwatch.org/article/prospera-demands-honduras-pay-11-billion-outlawing-privately-run-city">Honduras Próspera</a>, is suing the country for a staggering <a href="https://www.lawg.org/the-zedes-law-in-honduras-sanctuary-for-exploitation-corruption-and-organized-crime/">$10.7 billion</a>, which represents two-thirds of the government’s projected budget for 2023. </p>

<p data-line-id="66fee53516ad459b88fc092f598743bc"> BONN – The world stands at a critical juncture in the fight against climate change. Either we drastically accelerate the clean-energy transition, or our fast-dwindling chances of preventing global temperatures from surpassing 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels will be destroyed. Few understand the stakes better than Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="485225539ec442d6a644187b5c25346d"> These countries comprise one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. In the last year alone, the LAC region endured a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/2023-atlantic-hurricane-season-ranks-4th-for-most-named-storms-in-year">destructive hurricane season</a>, a deadly heat wave, and severe drought, which produced an acute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/drought-leaves-millions-in-uruguay-without-tap-water-fit-for-drinking">water crisis</a> in Uruguay and undermined <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-send-energy-drought-stricken-ecuador-2023-10-29/">hydropower production</a> in countries like Ecuador. The credit-ratings agency Moody’s estimates that climate change could cost the equivalent of <a href="https://www.economy.com/economicview/analysis/394150/Latin-America-Under-the-Risk-of-Climate-Change">16% of the region’s GDP</a> this century. </p>
<p data-line-id="62c523ddf29f45eba605be6510086c2d"> But LAC countries also have vast potential to lead – and even propel – the global renewable-energy transition. As the International Energy Agency points out in its first <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/latin-america-energy-outlook-2023"><em>Latin America Energy Outlook</em></a>, renewables, led by hydropower, already account for 60% of the region’s electricity – twice the global average – and some of the world’s most robust wind and solar resources imply room for further growth. Latin America also possesses huge reserves of critical minerals vital to the clean-energy transition, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/20/why-crashing-lithium-prices-will-not-make-electric-cars-cheaper">more than half</a> of the world’s lithium. And it is positioned to become a leader in the production and use of green hydrogen. </p>
<p data-line-id="64652c1c8eb147e8839b7ca04957423d"> Moving onto a climate-safe trajectory will require radical, decisive, and immediate action, underpinned by global collaboration, strong political leadership, effective public-private partnerships, and well-designed regulatory frameworks. It will also require money: according to the IEA, the region must double renewable-energy investment by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="9166baad5dad4c51a31ae4a2431d9c00"> This investment would deliver energy access to the approximately 17 million people currently living without electricity; avert 30,000 premature deaths through clean cooking; and create one million jobs in clean-energy industries. But, like any socioeconomic transformation, the clean-energy transition risks leaving some groups behind, with women, rural communities, and indigenous people most at risk. To avoid this outcome, climate initiatives – and the goals that underpin them – must reflect principles of justice and inclusivity. </p>
<p data-line-id="f108fa4a68b34a7194d64928300facb2"> The energy transition depends on infrastructure. Latin America’s existing energy infrastructure has been built largely to support the production and consumption of oil and gas. To facilitate the development, storage, distribution, and transmission of renewables, the region now must build more interconnected grids and expand supportive infrastructure on land and at sea. Greater cross-border connectivity and scalable storage systems are essential to ensure that renewables-based systems across Latin America can withstand the worsening effects of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="49258b6e6a2e4534bb149c693d3e5149"> Costa Rica offers a model for how this can be done. The country is undergoing a profound transformation across every facet of its economy in an effort to become the world’s <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/costa-ricas-commitment-path-becoming-carbon-neutral">first carbon-neutral country</a> by 2050. In 2020, the Inter-American Development Bank modeled over 3,000 potential futures for Costa Rica and found that it would meet or almost meet its net-zero ambitions in <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA600/RRA633-1/RAND_RRA633-1.pdf">over 75% of them</a> – in nearly half, it predicted that the country would go even further, reaching net-negative emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c25bcc0d0bb4f0285babdb3bfebb275"> Other LAC countries are similarly well-placed to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, decarbonize their economies, and enhance their energy security. To this end, they should be developing their renewable-energy capabilities and working to boost energy efficiency. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero is helping here by working with local financial institutions to <a href="https://www.gfanzero.com/latin-america-and-caribbean-network/">bolster climate finance</a> in the region – an example of how public-private partnerships can help deliver sustainability and prosperity for all. </p>
<p data-line-id="28ee325f84d04dc1815203688df29d5e"> Of course, strategies will differ across countries. In the Caribbean, the climate, geography, and topography complicate the generation and transfer of renewable energy. <a href="https://www.carboncollective.co/sustainable-investing/distributed-generation-dg">Distributed generation</a> – meaning that electricity is generated near the point of use – is one way to overcome these challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="7b4b377b8e4e4e5ebdc4e52c377a8c32"> The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet has already begun deploying this technology in the region. In Haiti, for example, GEAPP is supporting the <a href="https://www.energyalliance.org/project-case-study/geapp-alina-eneji-haiti/">creation of mesh grids</a> – decentralized modular grids that enable households to generate most of the energy they consume with solar panels but are also connected to their neighbors in power-sharing clusters. By combining the simplicity, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of solar home systems with the resilience of a grid, mesh grids can deliver cost-effective energy access in remote areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="ed2b29c748914b5aa7b2f5ac2b50b269"> Battery energy storage systems – rechargeable batteries that can store energy from different sources – are another important technological solution. By helping to stabilize the electricity grid and ensure a reliable power supply during the energy transition, BESS can help countries to reach their renewable-energy goals while boosting their economies and lifting people out of generational poverty. Already, the global BESS market is on track to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/enabling-renewable-energy-with-battery-energy-storage-systems">double in size</a> by 2030. GEAPP’s <a href="https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/geapp-glc-accelerate-affordable-clean-energy-for-all/">BESS Consortium</a> is working to ensure that the benefits of this technology are felt across all income levels. </p>
<p data-line-id="9a4b8a1e834f4fad92b0c0b1078b150a"> The journey to a sustainable future will be a long one, involving continuous investment and innovation. New energy-storage solutions, together with enhanced regional connectivity, will form the backbone of robust, resilient, and modern energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, as LAC countries recognize, projects will have to be designed and implemented with social justice and the inclusion of indigenous communities in mind. </p>
<p data-line-id="7585ac6c814248908d3af64687b5e581"> The LAC region is committed both to mitigating climate change and ensuring climate justice. With effective public-private partnerships and concerted investments that support a strong supply chain, the region can achieve the energy revolution that its people – and the world – need. </p>

<p data-line-id="2c6150ff8306491f8da02bcf47c830a8"> BOSTON – These are unique and troubling times for the United States. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/09/politics/analysis-donald-trump-indictment/index.html">twice-impeached</a> former president who now faces <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictments-details-guide-charges-trial-dates-people-case/">four separate indictments</a> for serious crimes is the de facto leader of one of the two main political parties. Having remade the Republican Party in his image, Donald Trump will almost certainly be its nominee in the 2024 presidential election, despite mounting evidence of his financial misdeeds and role in an attempted coup. While Democrats <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/elections-2023-democrats-enjoy-a-strong-night/">fared well</a> in various elections this month, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-matchup/index.html">polls</a> show Trump leading US President Joe Biden in key battleground states. Clearly, something is rotten in the American Republic. </p><p data-line-id="d6f56131c0434b8dbb2afd9902203aed"> A second Trump presidency would be a much greater threat to democracy than the first. Trump’s own outlook and rhetoric suggest that he has been radicalized further, and his supporters have now learned from their failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Friendly think tanks are drawing up plans to dismantle the US government’s checks and balances, allowing Trump to usher in a police state targeting his political opponents. The Heritage Foundation’s <a href="https://www.project2025.org/playbook/">Project 2025</a> aims to “create a playbook of actions to be taken in the first 180 days of the new administration to bring quick relief to Americans suffering from the left’s devastating policies.” Central to that effort will be to staff key positions with Trumpian cadres. </p><p data-line-id="49bd5f6f1cca4489a0576cad057f8498"> While Trump and his enablers in the political establishment obviously bear the blame for this dire state of affairs, so do the American left and the fact-based media, which have failed to develop a well-calibrated response. Reactions vary from implicit normalization (who can deny a major party’s choice of nominee?) to showing zero tolerance toward Trump’s supporters. But a practical blueprint for addressing the situation is missing, even though the future of American democracy is at stake. </p>

<p data-line-id="6a610f15a7d44d978e6fab842b1a9020"> CAMBRIDGE – In the run-up to 2023, the outlook for the global economy appeared bleak. Analysts predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in energy prices would trigger a significant economic downturn in Europe. Bloomberg Economics <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-17/forecast-for-us-recession-within-year-hits-100-in-blow-to-biden?sref=4rOwJ71Y">proclaimed</a> that there was a 100% probability that the United States would suffer a recession. Few believed that most developing economies could withstand the combination of rising energy prices, soaring interest rates, and a downturn in developed countries. </p><p data-line-id="e15bbea39e22431483adccc73de8f367"> Had forecasters anticipated the war between Israel and Hamas and its potential for regional escalation, the intensification of the Russia-Ukraine war, and political turbulence in some Western countries, their pessimism would have been even more pronounced. Moreover, the extraordinary <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-07/what-us-treasury-volatility-means-for-the-economy">volatility</a> in the US Treasury market, a key benchmark for numerous domestic and international markets, would have fueled fears about a looming global recession, as would have US bank failures. </p><p data-line-id="05a6b8d5a90a429aba51b66171e41f91"> But while the past year’s unforeseen political, geopolitical, and market upheavals <em>should</em> have further dampened the world’s growth outlook, the global economy surprised on the upside. The vast majority of developed economies defied expectations, successfully avoiding economic contraction. Developing countries as a whole avoided financial distress. Even China, despite its disappointing growth, showcased the resilience of its economy as the year drew to a close. </p>

<p data-line-id="e734e74258534550b9a4c2679c88dbf5"> HONG KONG – Last month, China held its first <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-finance-jinping-property-479d4914e2596c0e659b33ff39b74252">Central Financial Work Conference</a> – the highest-level review of the financial sector that the Communist Party of China (CPC) conducts – since 2017. Given that China’s financial sector includes the world’s <a href="https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-06/24/content_5697438.htm">largest</a> banking system by <a href="http://camlmac.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4820197/index.html">assets</a> ($53.1 trillion) – and the <a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/InvestChinaA/document/understandingchinaa.pdf">second-largest</a> (after the United States) by stock-market capitalization – and that the full Politburo Standing Committee attends the conference, the decisions made, and even the tone struck, have global implications. </p><p data-line-id="bdf0522861c542639db156e03cb80151"> The <a href="https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202310/content_6912992.htm">report</a> released after the conference confirmed that the CPC’s fundamental view of the financial sector has not changed. For China’s leaders, the fundamental function of finance is to serve the real economy, and the government is responsible for maintaining stability, managing risks, and promoting homegrown innovation and high-quality development. </p><p data-line-id="579fd34dc1ac4b2ab87913ccdded058b"> But the focus of the discussions shifted significantly since 2017, when the main priority was managing the imbalances arising from shadow banking, local-government spending, and real-estate excesses. All of the risks in these domains had been exacerbated by the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus that China’s government implemented in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. </p>

predicts that the upcoming climate summit in Dubai will build a global consensus on sustainable investing.        </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="621c8da93a824afd8b4db7346254f953"> DUBAI – It has become increasingly clear from the vast array of information on climate change that advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals is an essential part of any long-term solution to the crisis. Although the loosely defined concept remains a work in progress, the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai provides an opportunity for business leaders and policymakers to agree on how ESG can best contribute to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. </p>
<p data-line-id="699f2fdd19fa4c24931edfb495aeecb1"> Sound ESG strategies that focus on robust standards, clear metrics, and strict compliance procedures can improve the investment decision-making process for firms in all sectors. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to unlock debt and equity financing, while also yielding reputational returns. </p>
<p data-line-id="27d07fce184a457c869ea5076c3fd12d"> Beyond offering substantial benefits, ESG has become a business imperative. As the global race to achieve net-zero emissions intensifies, firms looking to form new alliances and partnerships must be able to outline their ESG strategy and, crucially, explain how they plan to execute it. This makes it even more important to develop a cohesive, equitable, and transparent approach to ESG at COP28 and secure buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders. </p>
<p data-line-id="ffcbc4f801ef4f2c99ee5855574c4a5d"> ESG has gained significant momentum in the Middle East in the run-up to COP28: nearly two-thirds of regional organizations <a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/esg/survey.html">surveyed</a> by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) earlier this year reported adopting a formal ESG strategy in the last 12 months. This would have been unimaginable only a few years ago, when very few in the region were taking the concept seriously. And the trend looks set to continue, as 66% of survey respondents want their CEO and board to allocate more time to ESG-related issues. </p>
<p data-line-id="600dd95b03f04079af9eae9d3144083a"> Moreover, the fact that 40% of respondents hope that COP28 will lead to governments improving ESG infrastructure and providing incentives for green growth underscores the significance of the climate summit. Fortunately, the United Arab Emirates is already spearheading the reform effort, building awareness of how an ESG framework can pave the way to a net-zero economy. On the environmental side, the UAE has announced plans to invest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/uae-plans-to-invest-54-billion-in-renewables-in-net-zero-push">$54 billion</a> in renewables over the next seven years and has pledged <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-05/uae-pledges-4-5-billion-to-help-finance-africa-climate-projects#xj4y7vzkg">$4.5 billion</a> to finance climate projects in Africa. Mobilizing these huge sums ahead of COP28, as well as undertaking major initiatives to support <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/markets/2023/02/09/strong-pipeline-of-green-bonds-likely-from-middle-east-in-2023-sp-says/">social and governance investments</a>, demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to championing ESG at the summit and beyond. </p>
<p data-line-id="099bbf19bc6c49daa069e5acc7929c44"> Banks must also do their part, which means raising awareness of the central role that ESG plays in sustainable finance and ensuring that there are enough green financial products – including <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/islamic-finances-answer-sdgs-and-climate-change">Sharia-compliant instruments</a> – to meet soaring demand from customers. They should also improve ESG reporting metrics to streamline internal and sector-wide data collection. While such changes take time, a more immediate fix could be improving in-house training to help staff better incorporate ESG factors into investment decisions and overall bank strategy. </p>
<p data-line-id="f779605d21884d5cbc3235a51310722e"> A meaningful shift in resource management is already underway. Today, 27% of Middle Eastern companies responding to the PwC survey have a chief sustainability officer, and almost half of those individuals are primarily responsible for ESG. Relatedly, only 20% of respondents this year said that the CEO had overall control of ESG, down from around 55% last year. Corporate leaders across the region are clearly attaching more importance to these principles. </p>
<p data-line-id="1bd6dc4bbf984921bc594fb7b95c886b"> While large corporations will find it easier to navigate the increasingly complex framework of green financing, small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) will require more support and should not be an afterthought – especially in the UAE economy. According to <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/business/small-and-medium-enterprises/small-and-medium-enterprises">government data</a> published in mid-2022, the country is home to 557,000 SMEs, which account for 63.5% of non-oil GDP, and that number could grow to one million by 2030. If ESG is to be successful, it must become a key component of business for companies of all sizes. </p>
<p data-line-id="956da24a9fac415fa884ed6a2684fc7a"> Global warming represents an existential threat, but the magnitude of the challenge has given rise to unprecedented dynamism: governments and business leaders are embracing new frameworks and radical measures to ensure rapid and significant progress on climate action. COP28 in Dubai will only accelerate this process, especially when it comes to building a consensus on ESG implementation. Speed is of the essence, because the sooner companies begin incorporating ESG into their investment decisions, the better they will do – both economically and environmentally – on the path to net-zero emissions. </p>

<p data-line-id="2aea7a03c08e48598b0227c20252ec32"> LONDON – Argentina’s President-elect Javier Milei, a libertarian economist and self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/argentina-votes-for-new-president-to-confront-economic-crisis-99b73b86">anarcho-capitalist</a>,” has pledged to rejuvenate his country’s ailing domestic economy and tame runaway inflation. This is a daunting task, given Argentina’s dismal economic track record over the past few decades and history as a serial defaulter – the latest episode being the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-debt-idUSKCN2500RH/">2020 restructuring</a> of $65 billion in sovereign debt. </p><p data-line-id="9f8166935b2b48e3961b07ca55a76d0f"> With its GDP expected to <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/10/10/world-economic-outlook-october-2023">shrink by 2.5%</a> in 2023 and inflation running above <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">140%</a>, Argentina’s economic outlook appears bleak. The peso has fallen to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/argentinas-peso-currency-hits-fresh-record-low-informal-market-2023-10-10/">record lows</a> against the US dollar, causing the gap between the official exchange rate and the black-market rate to <a href="https://bnn.network/finance-nav/currencies/blue-dollar-surge-argentinas-exchange-rate-gap-exceeds-150/">exceed 150%</a>, and the country is at risk of defaulting on its debt for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-21/argentina-bond-investors-are-preparing-for-another-default-after-elections#:~:text=Prices%20for%20the%20dollar%20notes,five%20years%2C%20CDS%20data%20show.">tenth time</a>. As has been the case historically, addressing Argentina’s macroeconomic imbalances will require reducing public spending without exacerbating the economic crisis. </p><p data-line-id="7eca06c89c98408892f1dd071cd523f9"> To that end, Milei has proposed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/milei-wins-in-argentina-edging-the-country-closer-to-the-us-dollar.html">dollarizing</a> the Argentinian economy and establishing the greenback as the country’s sole legal tender. This approach is not entirely unprecedented. Previous attempts to introduce macroeconomic discipline included the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/currency-board">currency board system</a>, which pegged the peso one-to-one to the dollar for almost a decade, before collapsing in the early 2000s amid yet another debt crisis. Milei’s plan would scrap the peso altogether, based on the belief that shutting down the central bank’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-free-market-fundamentalism-of-argentinas-javier-milei">printing press</a>” will effectively rein in public spending. </p>

<p data-line-id="ef5ae64a6cb54a7982a37ed09a12341f"> BERLIN – Earlier this month, Germany’s Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/62514268-6981-4530-89a4-0b41c54be94f">ruled</a> that the government’s plan to redirect unused COVID-19 aid funds toward combating climate change violated the so-called debt brake. The decision is not just a setback for Chancellor <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/olaf-scholz">Olaf Scholz</a>; it could also deepen the ideological divisions within the coalition government and undermine the country’s fiscal policy, thereby posing a grave threat to its economic outlook. </p><p data-line-id="a4fde4f9739140b299d715d70044fa67"> Germany introduced the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60674329-5be3-4802-a05a-851ee2990efd">debt brake</a> into its constitution in 2009, imposing limits that were far more rigid than those required by the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact. The brake largely prohibits the federal and state governments from taking on <a href="https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/scholz-suggests-extending-debt-brake-another-year-against-objections/#:~:text=The%20brake%20restricts%20the%20German,for%20in%20the%20Maastricht%20Treaty.">new debt</a>; exceptions are allowed only in extreme emergencies. The federal government used this <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Downloads/Public-Finances/germanys-federal-debt-rule.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=5">emergency exemption</a> in 2020 to allocate more than €200 billion in special funds to mitigate the pandemic’s economic impact. </p><p data-line-id="76847ba500b646f2a77bedc8d9e36da7"> Scholz’s government tried to use the same exemption to channel <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/business/germanys-traffic-light-coalition-looses-public-trust-amid-budget-crisis-15983368">€60 billion</a> ($66 billion), or 1.5% of GDP, from these special funds toward industrial subsidies and climate-related initiatives. The opposition Christian Democratic Union then appealed to the Court, which <a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/bvg23-101.html;jsessionid=DD1A322A296C222FF2E7D4AC75E0F256.internet002">blocked</a> the government’s plan on the grounds that it did not meet the “constitutional requirements for emergency borrowing.” Ironically, it was the CDU, under the leadership of former Chancellor <a href="https://www2.project-syndicate.org/columnist/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a>, that established this special fund. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="1fc73b5cf2d74f189fa3cbf66078c37b"> NEW YORK – To avert catastrophic climate change, an active and empowered civil society is necessary. The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai is almost certain to provide further proof that we will fail if we rely on large, powerful institutions such as governments and multinational corporations. </p>
<p data-line-id="b3cb568189734ca3aa83348dbe39c0b6"> Fossil-fuel companies have known about their contributions to climate change <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa815f?_sm_au_=iVV24w1JV7kRbjMJ">since the 1970s</a>, yet they <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/POL3073822023ENGLISH.pdf">continue to drill</a> and expand their operations. While governments have paid lip service to the problem by adopting the UN <a href="https://unfccc.int/">Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> and the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">Paris climate agreement</a>, the latest <a href="https://productiongap.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PGR2023_ExecSum_web.pdf"><em>Production Gap Report</em></a> shows how little these commitments mean in practice. Between now and 2030, output in the top 20 fossil-fuel-producing countries will be more than double the amount consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius. </p>
<p data-line-id="ebdc567ab4504755b065159534f0feac"> Self-regulation by governments and fossil-fuel companies is woefully insufficient, not least because governments and fossil-fuel companies are often <a href="https://productiongap.org/2023report/">one and the same</a>. For too long, both have sought to appease public concerns with greenwashing campaigns and the promise of future silver-bullet technologies such as carbon capture and storage. And when some segment of the public is not pacified by such ploys, many of these same governments and companies have been all too willing to resort to quashing freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. </p>
<p data-line-id="c40ebb074e834042bae8db838c654747"> Only through collective action, advocacy, and civil-society participation in policymaking will governments be forced to do what it takes to phase out fossil fuels, support the transition to renewable energy, and protect human rights in a world of increasingly extreme weather and drought. But civil society cannot thrive without civic space – public fora where citizens can jointly criticize and pressure the most powerful, without fear or suppression. And at COP28, outside the protected confines of the UN’s “<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/un-climate-change-conference-united-arab-emirates-nov/dec-2023/about-cop-28#What-is-the-difference-between-the-blue-zone-and-the-green-zone-at-COP-28">blue zone</a>,” there will be virtually no civic space at all. </p>
<p data-line-id="8702272d5d0a4c8d81c628191a7db9e6"> Dubai is one of the <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/06/dubai-leaps-worlds-7th-most-expensive-city-luxury-living-overtaking-paris-zurich">most expensive cities</a> in the world, which means that lodging, food, and other expenses will be prohibitively costly for most people, especially the disadvantaged and marginalized who are most affected by the climate crisis. Moreover, it is illegal in the United Arab Emirates even to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/uae-conference-attendees-warned-against-criticizing-government">criticize the government</a>, or to say anything deemed to “harm the public interest,” and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35852341">foreigners</a> are sometimes detained for comments <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uae-dubai-tiktok-arrest-satire-alrind-3a73fb34f8ab210372b563e67facc04f">made while in the country</a>. Minor signs of dissent during the 2011 Arab Spring were quickly and forcibly <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/09/20/the-uae-has-avoided-an-arab-spring-by-systematically-repressing-critical-speech/">repressed</a>. To this day, scores of human-rights activists and dissidents remain arbitrarily detained, including 60 members of the “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/uae-nearly-a-decade-of-unjust-imprisonment-for-uae-94-dissidents-2/">UAE-94</a>,” who were tried en masse in 2013. Four years later, the UAE imprisoned Ahmed Mansoor, the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/world-leaders-must-urge-uae-to-release-ahmed-mansoor-ahead-of-cop28-climate-conference/">only remaining Emirati</a> working publicly to defend human rights in the country. </p>
<p data-line-id="96203edc3d6b4261bd113d9b21c582b0"> The government has continued its repression in the run-up to COP28. It has cut off <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/01/joint-statement-uae-human-rights-record-ahead-cop28">communication</a> between many prisoners and their families, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/05/uae-authorities-must-ensure-man-forcibly-deported-is-safe-afforded-fair-trial-rights/">prosecuted</a> Emiratis who have been deported back to the country after seeking refuge abroad, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde25/7252/2023/en/">rejected</a> the UN’s calls to release prisoners of conscience. </p>
<p data-line-id="70baf4a126ba4e1d88960004de5c1c4c"> The UAE is also infamous for its use of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/11/uae-concerns-around-authorities-use-of-digital-surveillance-during-cop28/">unlawful electronic surveillance</a>. Mansoor is just one of many human-rights defenders who has been targeted with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/03/new-android-hacking-campaign-linked-to-mercenary-spyware-company/">spyware</a> developed by cybersurveillance companies such as NSO Group and Hacking Team. </p>
<p data-line-id="65199ead9e5342b9b8339f53805f2ff1"> Such abuses are more than sufficient to create a climate of fear among activists hoping to attend COP28. While the UAE <a href="https://wam.ae/article/hszrhmch-cop28-presidency-and-unfccc-sign-host-country">promises</a> to make “space available for climate activists to assemble peacefully and make their voices heard,” it remains to be seen what this will look like in practice. What risks might activists still face if they speak out about the UAE’s abysmal rights record or <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement-report-of-uae-goals-at-cop28-shows-a-failure-in-leadership-need-for-higher-standards/">failure</a> to phase out fossil fuels? We do not know, because the UNFCCC secretariat and the UAE have not even disclosed the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/30/united-nations-climate-change-conference-cop28">Host Country Agreement</a> – the bare-minimum standard of transparency for any COP. </p>
<p data-line-id="fca1a8ff31764336af48d00c84e66001"> Of course, the UAE is hardly alone in its hostile attitude toward civil society. Around the world, countries are cracking down on protesters, misapplying current law to stifle <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/09/viet-nam-three-year-sentence-for-renowned-climate-activist-is-self-inflicted-wound/">climate dissent</a>, and enacting new legislation to criminalize protest – often at the behest of powerful <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/7382/2023/en/">fossil-fuel companies</a>. Some of these laws <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/climate-justice-clashes-with-an-increasingly-intolerant-poland/">target climate activists directly</a>, indicating that summits like annual climate-change COPs are of particular concern to repressive governments. </p>
<p data-line-id="9b0d0f9ebc214fd2b986bf1eeb6e03d3"> Despite 2023 being another year of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/11/1143352">record-setting heat and rainfall events</a>, COP28 is unlikely to produce any meaningful outcome. That is as unjust as it is tragic. The people who suffer the most from climate change are not heads of state or fossil-fuel executives. In the UAE and around the world, those bearing the brunt of the crisis are often the same people facing discrimination, marginalization, and a lack of basic protection from their governments. </p>
<p data-line-id="6db4474112cf41a399bd4fd3c62321bb"> Since it is their futures that will be discussed at COP28, their engagement, activism, and demands for accountability are essential. It is through civil society that we will expose greenwashing and achieve the solutions that have long been promised. International conferences to discuss an existential global threat will generate meaningful results only if everyone is free to criticize, gather, and peacefully demonstrate. Repressive laws, a climate of fear, and imprisoned domestic dissidents can serve no purpose other than to support defenders of the status quo. </p>

<p data-line-id="9e9c7da9df2b4c59b8ef9a92754298ba"> NEW YORK – Already on a long winning spree, capital has just scored another big victory in a clash over the ethics of artificial intelligence. In the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/23/huge-egos-are-in-play-behind-the-firing-and-rehiring-of-openais-sam-altman">drama</a> over OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s sudden firing and rehiring, a non-profit company with a mission to prioritize AI safety over profits has failed spectacularly to keep its for-profit offspring on a leash. </p><p data-line-id="a63bd6d0c7974cb9951314749a799d50"> OpenAI, Inc. was founded in 2015 with the goal of ensuring that artificial general intelligence – autonomous systems that can outperform humans in all or most tasks – does not become <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">uncontrollable</a>, if and when it is ever achieved. AGI’s potential raises the same dilemma that Mary Shelley introduced in <em>Frankenstein</em>. Our creation might destroy us, but who can stop anyone from pursuing the fame, power, and wealth that “success” would confer? The Altman saga offers one answer: We cannot count on ethical rules, corporate-governance structures, or even principled governing board members to keep us safe. They tried, much to their credit, but it wasn’t enough. </p><p data-line-id="6fc596ad951b4eeb99ed7af0f7812682"> Originally, OpenAI, Inc. sought to raise enough funds <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure">through donations</a> to compete in a fast-developing and highly competitive domain. But with only $130 million generated in three years, it fell far short of its $1 billion goal. It would need to turn to private capital while trying to preserve its original mission within an elaborate governance structure. </p>

<p data-line-id="36c7f762512240a486f24a66d482ddc1"> CAIRO/GENEVA – In recent years, climate change has emerged as one of the leading drivers of migration. Shifting weather patterns, together with the growing severity and frequency of extreme weather events, have affected millions of people around the world, posing a significant threat to their lives and livelihoods. </p>
<p data-line-id="f69eb81999f94c3e9f9545d1fca2acf3"> In March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">sixth assessment report</a> (AR6), revealing that for every additional 1° Celsius rise in global temperatures, the risk of involuntary displacement due to flooding is expected to increase by <a href="https://emergencymanual.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1956/files/2023-03/iom_global_data_institute_thematic_brief_1_evidence_summary_on_climate_change_and_the_future_of_human_mobility.pdf">roughly 50%</a>. In Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, slow-onset climate disasters such as water stress, crop failure, and rising sea levels could displace <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4/">31-72 million</a> people by 2050 under a low-warming scenario. In a high-warming scenario, the number of displaced people could surge to 90-143 million. In Sub-Saharan Africa, flood-related displacement could rise by 200-600% by the 2070s, depending on the rate of population growth and anticipated temperature increases ranging from 1.6°C to 2.6°C. </p>
<p data-line-id="323db3e8e3eb495c89f043750dd50164"> While the Global South is disproportionally affected by the catastrophic effects of climate change, no part of the world is immune. The climate crisis will have far-reaching implications for global stability, security, and sustainable development, affecting not only migrants’ countries of origin but also transit and destination countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="f6b39449521848b7b90b0b516feaec3e"> The COP27 Presidency and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) are committed to addressing the challenge of climate-induced migration with the goal of fostering a more just and equitable world. Over the past year, we have collaborated with governments, civil-society organizations, other UN agencies, and various stakeholders to develop and promote sustainable approaches to climate-related mobility, including displacement. </p>
<p data-line-id="1925bf2a5d314f6eab081b48aaf74462"> To reduce the adverse effects of climate change that compel migrants to leave their countries of origin, we advocate the full implementation of the <a href="https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/180326_draft_rev1_final.pdf">Global Compact for Migration</a>. With the support of the IOM, the COP27 Presidency has highlighted Egyptian programs like the <a href="https://www.cccpa-eg.org/pdf_read_download.php?type=read&amp;newFileName=Climate+Responses+for+Sustaining+Peace+Initiative&amp;file=4415_17103347.pdf">Climate Responses for Sustaining Peace</a> and the <a href="https://www.sis.gov.eg/Story/185804?lang=en-us">Decent Life Initiative</a> as models that could be replicated worldwide. Taken together, these initiatives offer a roadmap for sustainable development, enabling governments to improve living standards and maintain peace in the face of climate-related threats. We have actively promoted these initiatives in various formal and informal forums, including the <a href="https://www.gfmd.org/">Global Forum on Migration and Development</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="ea21ed1f241c4865ae884adc5e8731b1"> For sure, there is still much work to be done. To address the urgent threat posed by climate change, the international community must support adaptation efforts, particularly in the Global South. Strengthening resilience is crucial to empowering populations to make informed decisions about whether to relocate or remain where they are. Achieving this, however, requires immediate and substantial financing for adaptation initiatives, including the much-anticipated <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries">Loss and Damage Fund</a> for developing countries announced at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh. Other crucial steps include ensuring the complementarity and accessibility of climate-funding instruments and incorporating human-mobility considerations into climate negotiations. </p>
<p data-line-id="608fe2db0b294c53991887d5250c2cc4"> As we approach COP28, we must focus on climate-related migration and displacement and develop concrete solutions that promote the safety and well-being of affected communities and individuals. This involves supporting the implementation of effective initiatives and the integration of migrants’ perspectives and experiences into decision-making processes. </p>
<p data-line-id="577f2feec25a44709ce367d700244fbd"> Climate change often exacerbates existing challenges and vulnerabilities, forcing communities to confront compounding crises. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize and address these underlying factors, including conflict, poverty, and inequality. To this end, we must adopt a holistic approach that promotes peace and security, reduces poverty and inequality, and fosters sustainable development. </p>
<p data-line-id="faf3323b3e0f4ae8b33f247e0c0eda9f"> Displacement is a complex and daunting challenge that requires a comprehensive, coordinated, and forward-looking response. By enhancing international cooperation, we could significantly improve the lives and livelihoods of those displaced by climate disasters and develop sustainable solutions that enable them to rebuild and contribute to their communities’ development. This approach is not only the right thing to do; it is also a crucial step toward building a more peaceful, just, and sustainable future for everyone. </p>
<p data-line-id="8664cb89cc8c4121b94ea07570ee981f"> The stakes of the current climate crisis are, or should be, obvious. The Mediterranean region, in particular, is no stranger to devastating environmental changes, as <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Bronze_Age_Collapse/">historical evidence</a> suggests that extreme weather events may have triggered mass displacement and led to the downfall of great civilizations during what is now known as the Late Bronze Age Collapse. </p>
<p data-line-id="70a470d3cf1841e395868dee3e9066d3"> To address climate-related displacement effectively, we must first understand and acknowledge the scale and complexity of the challenge. Only then will we recognize the need to engage all relevant stakeholders to develop proactive and sustainable solutions, avert the catastrophic effects of climate change, and build a world that is both prosperous and just. </p>

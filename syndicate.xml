    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="5ccfd7c8121149da9bd6300195168a5e"> NEW YORK – Even with the recent partial retreat in long-term real and nominal interest rates, they remain well above the ultra-low levels to which policymakers had grown accustomed, and they are likely to stay at such levels even as inflation retreats. It is now past time to revisit the widely prevailing “free lunch” view of government debt. </p>
<p data-line-id="f6ec2ab010634bbe83e3ab39d52fd80e"> The idea that interest rates would be low forever seemed to support the view that any concern about debt was an endorsement of “austerity.” Many came to believe that governments should run large deficits during recessions and only slightly smaller deficits in normal times. No one seemed concerned with the possible risks, in particular to inflation and interest rates. The left championed the notion that government debt could be used to expand social programs, going beyond what could be generated by reducing military spending, while those on the right seemed to believe that taxes exist only to be cut. </p>
<p data-line-id="0291fc1e962a418daa2d6ad11d745afc"> The most misguided approach involved using central banks to purchase government debt, which appeared costless when short-term interest rates were zero. This idea is at the core of Modern Monetary Theory and “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/helicopter-money-coronavirus-response-by-willem-h-buiter-1-2020-03">helicopter money</a>.” In recent years, even prominent macroeconomists have floated the idea of having the US Federal Reserve write off government debt after soaking it up through quantitative easing, a seemingly simple solution to any potential sovereign-debt problem. </p>
<p data-line-id="9cc6b4bfd87a475d85bb863d91e7a1c9"> But this approach assumed that even if global real interest rates rose, any increase would be gradual and temporary. The possibility that a sharp rise in interest rates would dramatically increase interest payments on existing debt, including debt held by central banks as bank reserves, was simply dismissed. But here we are: the Fed, which previously paid zero interest on these reserves, is now paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/some-treasury-bills-are-now-paying-5percent-what-investors-need-to-know.html">more than 5%</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="6d6eba4d988c4a65a28069fd225da33e"> Aside from a few notable exceptions, those who championed the notion that debt is a free lunch have not acknowledged the likelihood of a new reality. At a recent conference, I listened to a well-known financial commentator who had been a staunch advocate of the “lower forever” narrative and seemed unaware that it had been thoroughly debunked. When pressed, they conceded that if interest rates do not quickly revert to the ultra-low levels of the 2010s, budget deficits might matter after all. But they were reluctant to admit that the existing debt overhang could pose a problem, as this would impugn their previous endorsements of spendthrift fiscal policies. </p>
<p data-line-id="21685229a1874a55a3eefd514b174119"> Similarly, in a <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9749/Living_With_High_Public_SA_Sep_2_2023.pdf">recent paper</a> about the record levels of global debt, presented to the world’s leading central bankers at this year’s Jackson Hole conference, Serkan Arslanalp and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/barry-eichengreen">Barry Eichengreen</a> appeared reticent to discuss the implications of the current debt overhang or the connection between high government debt and sluggish growth in countries like Japan and Italy. </p>
<p data-line-id="8499f93609144829ad4067306a9f8ac3"> To be sure, the next recession, whenever it occurs, will likely lead to a significant decrease in interest rates, potentially offering a temporary respite to the wildly overleveraged US <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/liquidity-gridlock-worsens-us-commercial-real-estate-sector-2023-11-08/">commercial real-estate market</a>, where the mantra today is “stay alive until ’25.” If property owners can endure another year of falling rents and surging financing costs, the thinking goes, a sharp drop in interest rates in 2025 could stem the tide of red ink threatening to drown their businesses. </p>
<p data-line-id="046a07bfbdb6402587fad2fe77bafcbc"> But even if inflation declines, interest rates will likely remain higher for the next decade than they were in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis. This reflects a variety of factors, including soaring debt levels, deglobalization, increased defense spending, the green transition, populist demands for income redistribution, and persistent inflation. Even demographic shifts, often cited as a rationale for perpetually low interest rates, may affect developed countries differently as they increase spending to support rapidly aging populations. </p>
<p data-line-id="0a4d3150aa3e45429f4d21a212bc2ed7"> While the world can certainly adapt to higher interest rates, the transition is still ongoing. The shift could be particularly challenging for European economies, given that ultra-low interest rates have been the glue holding the eurozone together. The European Central Bank’s “<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-c2cd57a240fb403eb7e7c26bdbf7b8dd">whatever it takes</a>” bailout policies appeared costless when interest rates were near zero, but it is unclear whether the bloc can survive future crises if real interest rates remain high. </p>
<p data-line-id="fc8c22df09ea4da29cb4c85f2670aa8f"> As I have <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/japan-monetary-tightening-could-affect-global-economy-by-kenneth-rogoff-2023-10">previously argued</a>, Japan will struggle to move from its “zero forever” interest-rate policies, as its government and financial system have grown accustomed to treating debt as cost-free. In the United States, the commercial real-estate sector’s vulnerabilities, together with increased borrowing, could trigger another wave of inflation. Moreover, while major emerging economies have managed to cope with high interest rates so far, they face enormous fiscal pressures. </p>
<p data-line-id="2054c959841e462c88c3c1837364d2b1"> In this new global environment, policymakers and economists, even those who previously belonged to the “lower forever” camp, may need to reassess their beliefs in light of current market realities. While it is feasible to expand social programs or boost military capabilities without running large deficits, doing so without raising taxes is not costless. We are likely to find out the hard way that it never was. </p>

<p data-line-id="8dbabcf453914301ab7e4d6a9498ae7a"> NEW DELHI – The United States has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/nyregion/sikh-assassination-plot-charges-india.html">charged</a> Indian national Nikhil Gupta, a 52-year-old narcotics and weapons trader, for plotting to murder a prominent Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US citizen, in New York City. The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/did-india-order-the-murder-of-a-us-sikh-separatist-heres-what-we-know#:~:text=The%20indictment%20alleges%20that%20CC,to%20be%20a%20criminal%20associate.">indictment</a>, which alleges that an Indian government official in New Delhi paid Gupta to arrange the killing, has cast a shadow over India’s relationship with the US as well as the country’s global image. </p><p data-line-id="60e8bcdd167540a88f624d54d2122874"> We have been here before. Just a couple of months ago, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-read-statements-from-the-prime-minister-and-opposition-leaders-on/">claimed</a> that there were “credible allegations” about a “potential link” between India’s government and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/19/who-is-hardeep-singh-nijjar-sikh-canada-killed/">fatal shooting</a> in June of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, on Canadian soil. India responded with outrage, demanding the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/10/canada-removes-41-diplomats-from-india-after-new-delhi-threatens-to-revoke-their-immunity/">withdrawal</a> of 41 Canadian diplomats from New Delhi. </p><p data-line-id="21c3c895383d47a68e6bb4cc90c7581e"> But whereas Trudeau could not prove that the Indian government was involved in Nijjar’s killing, the US Justice Department is prepared to take its evidence to court. Among the damning details is one that seems to link the two killings: Gupta’s handler in New Delhi allegedly sent him a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/us-indictment-india-assassination-attempt-sikh-activist">video clip</a> “showing Nijjar’s bloody body slumped in his vehicle,” which Gupta carelessly shared with the hitman he had hired. </p>

<p data-line-id="b975477f7b364f3ca66e6dc372cb7493"> LONDON – Irish author Paul Lynch has been awarded this year’s Booker Prize, one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the English-speaking world, for his novel <a href="https://oneworld-publications.com/work/prophet-song/"><em>Prophet Song</em></a><em> – </em>and for good reason. With its harrowing vision of Ireland descending into tyranny, Lynch’s book perfectly captures the anxiety that characterizes our current political moment. </p><p data-line-id="b863773f44ab458db198b67774d5f107"> Not all critics were impressed. One reviewer described it as a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/booker-prize-2023-winner-paul-lynch-prophet-song-6s8pthl3d">flapping turkey</a>” of a book, criticizing Lynch for his sub-Orwellian themes and prose. But most reviews have been more favorable, with many lauding the book for reflecting mounting concerns about the future of parliamentary democracy in Western Europe and beyond. Lynch’s portrayal of a country sliding into authoritarian rule would certainly resonate with far-right leaders such as the recently triumphant Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and France’s Marine Le Pen. </p><p data-line-id="de3e1fae32634d1585760d25c7e09c00"> Wilders’ stunning <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/geert-wilders-outsider-nationalism-by-ian-buruma-2023-11">victory</a> in the Dutch general election underscores the growing support for far-right parties across Europe. For more than two decades, he has been a vocal critic of the Netherlands’ immigration policies, frequently targeting the country’s Muslim community. His rise to prominence can be largely attributed to the blend of identity politics and simplistic solutions characteristic of today’s populist movements. </p>

<p data-line-id="0307ff840aca4936a12ecd6b4d7e58c5"> NAIROBI – Efforts to build the nascent green-hydrogen industry in Africa are underway, most notably in Namibia’s Tsau Khaeb National Park. In May, the Namibian government <a href="https://www.slrconsulting.com/public-documents/hyphen-project/">signed</a> a feasibility and implementation agreement with Hyphen Hydrogen Energy for a green-hydrogen production and supply project close to the coastal town of Lüderitz. In June, the government <a href="https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/namibia-agrees-to-take-up-24-stake-in-10bn-green-hydrogen-project-2023-06-21">agreed</a> to take a 24% equity stake in the $10 billion project, whose value is nearly equal to Namibia’s GDP. </p>
<p data-line-id="a286448952ce454e989a5e8a1089a5af"> Once fully operational, the project is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/dutch-firms-partner-namibia-to-create-sovereign-wealth-fund">expected</a> to produce 350,000 metric tons of green hydrogen per year and <a href="https://hyphenafrica.com/projects/">create</a> 3,000 permanent jobs (in addition to 15,000 temporary construction jobs). It could position Namibia as a major producer of low-cost green hydrogen. But important questions remain about the project’s local value addition and how to avoid the creation of another extractive industry. </p>
<p data-line-id="b5f3185983574264ad894d4180e5057d"> For decades, African countries have invested billions of dollars in fossil-fuel energy systems, and yet <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings">600 million</a> people on the continent remain without access to electricity. Even as global warming destroys ecosystems, undermines food security, and worsens water scarcity, Africa still <a href="https://ecdpm.org/application/files/2416/7422/1814/Scaling-up-African-clean-energy-Discussion-Paper-334-ECDPM-2023.pdf">relies heavily</a> on fossil fuels; renewables account for only about <a href="https://ca1-clm.edcdn.com/assets/renewable_energy_transition_in_sub-saharan_africa.pdf">21%</a> of electricity generation. But the rapidly escalating climate crisis implies an urgent need to reorient the continent’s energy system away from oil and gas. </p>
<p data-line-id="a065c80dd28c4022871432869859378d"> A rapid rollout of renewable energy could be transformative, helping Africa meet the twin challenges of climate change and underdevelopment. But to ensure electricity access for all, such systems must be environmentally sound and socially inclusive. Ironically, the continent’s limited energy infrastructure means that African countries can leapfrog past fossil fuels (thus avoiding stranded assets as the world shifts to renewable energy) and build a green economy that is based on renewables and designed to meet their needs. </p>
<p data-line-id="d00ac79330cc4a3a8687108e11a881c0"> Low-cost green hydrogen can expand energy access on the continent and accelerate the shift toward renewables. And by creating local value chains, generating green jobs, and transferring technology and knowledge, it could also contribute enormously to the development of producer countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="99fc8df879e74703b4b5e57be6e2f2fc"> But, to reap these benefits, the development of green hydrogen in Africa must primarily serve African interests. That means the processes and policies for generating and using green hydrogen must comply with the standards set out in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, the ambitious global targets introduced by the United Nations in 2015. They must also meet the objectives of the Paris climate agreement and the African Union’s <a href="https://au.int/en/agenda2063/overview">Agenda 2063</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="2cf1dcf46f284782adee8eda7055c597"> Such projects must also maintain ecosystem integrity, promote decent work and economic prosperity, boost social inclusion and cohesion, and respect human rights. Crucially, these objectives can be met only by gaining broad public acceptance: the free, prior, and informed consent and participation of potentially affected communities. </p>
<p data-line-id="a22d61cc945c4d2b98c2b68b9bbd7b01"> Good governance and transparency in developing green hydrogen could change power relations between the developed world and African countries. Instead of falling into the trap of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/23/un-indigenous-peoples-forum-climate-strategy-warning">green colonialism</a>,” these countries could build equal partnerships that address head-on issues of equity and ownership, inclusion, resource competition, and displacement. </p>
<p data-line-id="4ee70d3a8f354068a7d45a1ebb25c989"> To be sure, green-hydrogen projects pose significant risks. Chief among these are land-use conflicts, forced resettlement, expropriation, and other potential human-rights violations. There are also environmental concerns, including the fact that production requires large amounts of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01375">freshwater</a>. Given that <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-taking-bottom-approach-water-management?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab20002dbb93cc7650e9bc237f34e6d45ae0899dcb025f43755a2f24eda031ac87da2908e7b0fac114300075cf91fb9e559720c3e9f61ef6249cc7965bc480aa48ad63452a253827eccb18ed4364dd4381c8c913d6f228380eea97">one in three Africans</a> faces water scarcity, developing this energy source could compound the problem, and may even cause or exacerbate conflicts, especially in Africa’s driest regions. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f65f0bea25e400dbba3c297919fe58c"> Moreover, large-scale plants, as well as export infrastructure, could damage fragile ecosystems, destroy protected areas, and endanger marine life. This is especially true if desalinated seawater is used in hydrogen production, and the resulting brine is released, untreated, into local bodies of water. </p>
<p data-line-id="50262c07663f4255b7fedaad7a42cea7"> But the biggest concern is that green hydrogen produced in Africa could be exported elsewhere. This would defeat the purpose of developing renewable-energy capacity on the continent. Instead of expanding electricity access and boosting climate resilience, this new industry would merely be the latest in a long line of energy injustices. Moreover, it would be wasteful: converting hydrogen into derivatives like ammonia – which are more suitable for transport – can result in <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Nov/IRENA_Green_hydrogen_policy_2020.pdf">13-25% energy loss</a>, while transportation itself requires high energy inputs. </p>
<p data-line-id="b05a2af55ff048ba89e917a125087b1e"> Green hydrogen can fuel economic growth and prosperity for producer countries. But to realize the potential of a hydrogen-powered economy, African leaders must ensure that the industry is structured to achieve a just energy transition on the continent and serve the needs of local communities, not foreign interests. </p>

<p data-line-id="457baf0b92ac47e7825b916ea61e3fa6"> MILAN – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) has begun in Dubai. Depending on whom you ask, the outlook ranges from deeply pessimistic to cautiously optimistic. But there is one thing on which almost everyone agrees: effective climate action is more urgent than ever. </p><p data-line-id="b1f1c14ecd824466a34733f42483c689"> This shared sense of urgency at COP28 is crucial. Some <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/un-climate-change-conference-united-arab-emirates-nov/dec-2023/about-cop-28">70,000 delegates</a> – including representatives of all parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and a range of other stakeholders, from business leaders to climate scientists – are expected to participate. Such a vast and varied group might be unwieldy, but broad engagement – which has been on the rise in recent years – is vital to progress. Committed global action at every level of government, the economy, and society is needed to tackle such a complex, multifaceted challenge, and a growing awareness that time is running out should help to foster it. </p><p data-line-id="fbfa48cb28f544c184f7a59a0d95ee74"> While broad-based action is critical, however, the fact is that just a few key actors have the power to bring about a radical reduction in global emissions. More than 60% of all greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by just <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023">six economies</a>: China, the United States, India, the European Union, Russia, and Brazil (in order of total emissions). They must take the lead not only on reducing their own emissions, but also on advancing the development and diffusion of renewables and other technologies needed for the global energy transition. </p>

<p data-line-id="8295cbfead24498baf55f89bcfe829aa"> BERLIN – Hamas’s terrorist attack on October 7 has disabused many of us of our preconceived notions about the conditions for peace in the Middle East and the wider world. We are still reeling from the horrors of that day. In launching its attack, Hamas easily overcame Israel’s high-tech border security barriers without encountering any organized resistance. Its militants were able to slaughter more than 1,200 Israelis (mostly civilians) and take more than 200 hostages back to Gaza – broadcasting much of the carnage on social media. </p><p data-line-id="ce389ab77c9848da8f2befad75f823cd"> How could this have happened? With the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1211024508/israels-spy-agency-is-one-of-the-best-how-did-it-not-foresee-hamas-attacks">strongest army</a> and the best intelligence services in the Middle East, Israel presumably tracks all terrorist activities and threats on both sides of its borders. Yet it was caught off guard by a group operating strictly from the isolated and closely monitored enclave of Gaza. </p><p data-line-id="bd058e670eb341888a420e19edea6252"> The events of October 7 shattered many illusions. Outside observers and participants alike had come to believe that the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was irresolvable, and thus only manageable. The new hope was that Israel could make peace and establish diplomatic relations with neighboring Arab countries without resolving or even paying attention to the Palestine question. Peace in the Middle East would be achieved without involving the Palestinians or creating a Palestinian state. We now know that this was an illusory goal. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfce23fa8eb544e881748044bd75a2cf"> WASHINGTON, DC/BERKELEY/KYIV – On his recent visit to the United States, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/xi-jinping-hosted-by-u-s-business-leaders/">encouraged American companies</a> to regard his country as a close trading partner. In fact, US companies should be seeking to move their supply chains and other business away from China – while they still have the time. Through its deliberate and repeated actions, China is heading for an economic showdown with the US. </p><p data-line-id="ec708cf666db4671aef2d06c8502fbb9"> For many decades, Western governments have pursued versions of what Germans call <em>Wandel durch Handel</em><em> </em>(change through trade), hoping to achieve global stability, reduce international confrontation, and (perhaps) promote more democracy through economic interaction with authoritarian regimes. The idea is simple: countries that trade extensively with each other will not jeopardize the resulting profits and jobs by going to war; prosperity and interdependence mitigate aggression. </p><p data-line-id="73c48a38591645bca395a83256ffe894"> In the post-World War II era, this strategy has sometimes worked astonishingly well. The establishment of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/European-Coal-and-Steel-Community#:~:text=European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community%20(ECSC)%2C%20administrative%20agency%20established,%2C%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20and%20Luxembourg.">European Coal and Steel Community</a> in 1952 took the key inputs for weapons production out of the hands of national governments and <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/history-eu/1945-59_en">led to the European Union</a> today. Germany and France (and later other Western European countries) became tightly linked by mutual trade and investment, so that war between any of them would impose an unbearable cost on victim and aggressor alike. Western Europe, a region that for centuries had been the most prone to interstate violence (often with disastrous global spillovers), became a bastion of peace. </p>

<p data-line-id="574e1c4da445425582eb9d92fe2579bd"> CAMBRIDGE – Ten years ago, Eugene Fama and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/robert-j-shiller">Robert J. Shiller</a> were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2013/press-release/">Nobel Prize in Economics</a> (together with Lars Peter Hansen) “for their empirical analysis of asset prices.” Fama and Shiller, however, hold diametrically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/business/3-american-professors-awarded-nobel-in-economic-sciences.html">opposing views</a> on asset-price movements, from what drives the decisions of economic actors to whether markets are inherently efficient. Fifteen years after the global economic crisis, it is a disagreement worth revisiting. </p><p data-line-id="0a2ba7b660ed4273ba211ac1e9f5d6cb"> Fama is a member of the Chicago School of economics, both literally – he is a professor at the Booth School of Business – and intellectually. The Chicago School holds that economic actors are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/12/why-do-econ-classes-barely-mention-behavioral-economics/578092/">rational utility-maximizing agents</a>, able to deploy infinite cognitive capacity and complete information at all times, in order to make decisions that will best serve their material interests. With his highly influential “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486">efficient market hypothesis</a>,” Fama takes this further, positing that prices almost immediately incorporate all available information about future values, and thus accurately reflect economic fundamentals. </p><p data-line-id="e0473c27a0064042a5446380982d5b8f"> Shiller, a Yale-based behavioral economist, could not disagree more. Taking a Keynesian view of markets, he argues that, in markets shaped by “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691145921/animal-spirits">animal spirits</a>,” individual actors have irrational tendencies, which can be amplified by the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182292/narrative-economics">collective mood</a> of the market. This sometimes results in irrational and suboptimal outcomes, such as speculative asset bubbles. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4c8bec3b78e424c82f602f581edf3a6"> BEIJING – For millennia, natural infrastructure – such as river systems, wetlands, coastal plains, sand dunes, and forests – supported the development of human civilization. In fact, our ability to harness such infrastructure, for everything from food and drinking water to storm-surge protection and flood mitigation, has been central to our success as a species. And it will prove vital to our future survival. </p>
<p data-line-id="b6adf9002f674db9bb4c7d266dc47038"> Technological advances propelled the evolution of infrastructure. Green turned to grey, with concrete, cable, and steel delivering energy, communications, and transportation – and, with them, unprecedented growth and development. But while rapid modernization produced once-unimaginable prosperity, it has had grave unintended consequences, not least the environmental degradation and greenhouse-gas emissions that are jeopardizing our very existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="fa874c80706a4e2f93b05190b6fc52cb"> The question now is how to meet urgent environmental goals – reducing emissions and protecting and restoring nature and biodiversity – while enabling developing economies to fulfill their legitimate growth aspirations. The answer, as a recent <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">report</a> from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank suggests, may well begin with an explicit acknowledgement of nature as infrastructure. </p>
<p data-line-id="623b2c6a4459462ab4d5d2c064cfc631"> Viewing nature as infrastructure is transformative, because it forces us to think in a more systemic way. As we pursue growth and development, we must not only avoid damaging nature; we must also strengthen and enrich it through “nature-positive” investments – all while tapping its vast potential to deliver essential services. </p>
<p data-line-id="3bf1110a2e494b6bba469a67b702d695"> Biologists already do this when they benchmark how to restore degraded land. But now economists must get on board and enhance their tools for capturing the value and complexity of natural capital. Biodiversity, for example, covers not just the number of species, but also their genetic diversity and diversity of functions. Yet another dimension of biodiversity is the complex evolutionary history of species – when they were separated on the “tree of life.” It is only by deepening our understanding of biodiversity that we will comprehend nature’s full potential – and our impact on it. </p>
<p data-line-id="84188ef77a7e44948488c278c5695b11"> This knowledge is very site-specific, and acquiring it will require contributions from scientists and local populations. The good news is that there are already models for such collaboration. The massive <a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/a/146836">Sanbei reforestation project</a>, aimed at preventing two large deserts from merging in Northern China, was a flawed endeavor at the start, with only single tree types planted. But, over the course of two decades, deeper knowledge of the local environment and the participation of local communities transformed it into a success. </p>
<p data-line-id="5ce562e746314c7b9569bdb7dbbdea06"> Governance and incentives are also crucial to protect and nurture natural infrastructure. In Indonesia, <a href="https://en.nabu.de/topics/ecosystems/mangrove-conservation-sulawesi.html">mangroves</a> have long protected communities, particularly poorer households, from deadly tidal floods, but they are being <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/mangrove-loss-threatens-community-resilience">depleted</a> in regions with weaker state capacity. In Egypt, by contrast, efforts to restore mangroves have been aided by <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2020-12/13/c_139586420.htm">revenues</a> from eco-tourism and beekeeping, which produces honey and supports the delivery of vital pollination services. </p>
<p data-line-id="62775e698f354ad7a02c1f8475ab14f7"> The nature-as-infrastructure approach demands that we assess what nature can deliver before considering grey solutions, and it can help countries close their infrastructure gaps in truly sustainable ways. But grey infrastructure will always be necessary for growth and development. This demands that we design it better, to minimize its impact on nature. For example, renewable-energy infrastructure has a large <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">ecological footprint</a>, and road infrastructure fragments and damages ecosystems. Solutions like <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">co-locating</a> infrastructure on brown sites and providing auxiliary infrastructure (such as wildlife highway crossings, green urban spaces, and nature-restoration offsets) can help mitigate these effects. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d801ad304f34e6287ef8632353494e6"> Of course, financing might pose a challenge. The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a>, agreed a year ago, assumes that <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">$598-824 billion per year</a> will be needed by 2030 to close the biodiversity funding gap. Such sums, needed to protect and then begin to restore nature, can be generated only by valuing nature properly and creating markets that will mobilize private and institutional capital. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c6f1aa3b8f84575b83341f060d7f800"> To this end, “nature as infrastructure” must be developed as an asset class, using new tools and financial instruments. At the micro level, this will require better pricing of nature’s services – for example, usage charges or permits and taxes for damaging activities – and adaptive local regulations. Micro-level policies can support the development of other financial instruments and, eventually, markets – for performance-linked bonds, policy-based lending, debt-for-nature swaps, and nature credits, to name a few – to channel more finance into nature. Lessons from carbon markets should be heeded, to avoid repeating past mistakes. </p>
<p data-line-id="b754ddcca33a49ccb82aa4b73840680b"> Special attention must be paid to low-income economies, many of which are highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation but have rich natural endowments that should be valued properly. Multilateral development banks can catalyze the nature-as-infrastructure approach, ensuring that it is incorporated into all aspects of their operations. Ultimately, this approach should also guide individual infrastructure projects and national growth strategies. </p>
<p data-line-id="92c8215a6a52477d98df30a91f31ecf3"> The consequences of the infrastructure decisions we make today will be felt for decades to come. Only by committing to invest in green – and to build grey better – can we ensure we lay the groundwork for a fairer, more sustainable, and inclusive global economy. </p>

<p data-line-id="f8d15fe7d3f64a6d8e3f5e3cf6317739"> AUSTIN – In a recent <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dcc702cb-0eec-4ac8-a0b8-c911a0b4f180">commentary</a> for the <em>Financial Times</em>, Martin Wolf trots out the specter of a “public-debt disaster,” that recurrent <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/debt-ceiling-yellen-spending-cuts/">staple</a> of bond-market chatter. The essence of his argument is that since debt-to-GDP ratios are high, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26f17a3f-2f64-45df-aff2-d0476dd53d42">eminent authorities</a> are alarmed, “fiscal crises” in the form of debt defaults or inflation “loom.” And that means something must be done<em>.</em></p><p data-line-id="1b05bbbaac4245ab82c30c1c692e4ab8"> While Wolf does not say explicitly what that something is, “painful fiscal choices seem to lie ahead.” Cue the chorus calling for <a href="https://www.crfb.org/issue-area/social-security">cuts</a> to Social Security and Medicare in the United States, and to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. </p><p data-line-id="6210e3a71577417fb61e166b84e6ee3b"> To bolster his argument, Wolf revisits an equation relating real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates, real growth rates, the “primary” budget deficit or surplus (net of interest payments on public debt), and the debt-to-GDP ratio. It is a familiar device, first offered up in a 1980s working paper by <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/olivier-blanchard">Olivier Blanchard</a>, then at MIT. I <a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/is-the-federal-debt-unsustainable">analyzed it in depth</a> for the Levy Economics Institute in 2011, and Blanchard recently revisited it <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/if-markets-are-right-about-long-real-rates-public-debt-ratios-will">for his blog</a>, with this conclusion: “If markets are right about long real rates, public debt ratios will increase for some time. We must make sure that they do not explode.” </p>

<p data-line-id="ade8def2233f472ea46243514fdf2532"> BERKELEY – When political leaders, policymakers, environmental advocates, and philanthropists gather for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28), food systems will be high on the agenda for the first time. Given that the food sector accounts for <a href="https://www.unido.org/stories/new-research-shows-food-system-responsible-third-global-anthropogenic-emissions">one-third</a> of all greenhouse-gas emissions, its inclusion is long overdue. </p>
<p data-line-id="def282215cb445389a6ec947c3b918b3"> But this welcome breakthrough risks being offset by the fact that COP28 is hosted by a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/petrostates-must-lead-cop28-with-global-south-investment-pledge-by-ban-ki-moon-et-al-2023-11">petrostate</a>, and presided over by the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11?a_la=english&amp;a_d=655e0b2078584c0b7cf797f6&amp;a_m=&amp;a_a=click&amp;a_s=&amp;a_p=%2Ftopic%2Fmaking-cop28-count&amp;a_li=cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11&amp;a_pa=topic-commentaries&amp;a_ps=main-article-a2&amp;a_ms=&amp;a_r=">leader</a> of that petrostate’s oil company. This is particularly concerning since averting catastrophic climate scenarios requires that we phase out fossil fuels and transform food systems with equal urgency. </p>
<p data-line-id="998ad11646b34ec987be6036b462ff4c"> Fortunately, these two challenges need not compete for our attention, because transforming food systems is also a powerful way to reduce our global dependency on fossil fuels. As our organization shows in a new <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/#:~:text=and%20Frameworks%2C%20Environment-,Power%20Shift%3A%20Why%20we%20need%20to%20wean,food%20systems%20off%20fossil%20fuels&amp;text=Our%20new%20research%20shows%20that,fossil%20fuel%20emissions%20every%20year.">report</a>, <em>Power Shift: Why We Need to Wean Our Industrial Food Systems Off Fossil Fuels</em>, food systems, from farm to plate to landfill, account for at least 15% of annual global fossil-fuel use – equal to that of the European Union and Russia combined. And if the current approach to industrial food production continues, that figure is expected to increase significantly. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c8d5fed45534e37b539d733a514972f"> Today’s industrial food system is increasingly fossil fuel-intensive. Fossil fuels go into synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the plastics that are used in everything from the coatings for those pesticides and fertilizers to most food packaging. Moreover, most packaging is needed to store ultra-processed foods – from meat and dairy to sweets and sugary drinks – all of which require highly energy-intensive manufacturing and petrochemicals in the form of plastics. </p>
<p data-line-id="457115f297484bdc904e6f33cd9adca5"> Worryingly, the energy sector views the food system as a promising growth market. Food-related plastics and synthetic fertilizers account for approximately <a href="https://story.futureoffood.org/power-shift/">40%</a> of all petrochemical products, and the International Energy Agency <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/bee4ef3a-8876-4566-98cf-7a130c013805/The_Future_of_Petrochemicals.pdf">predicts</a> that petrochemicals will drive nearly half the growth in oil demand by 2050, outstripping sectors like aviation and shipping. Similarly, research from the Center for International Environmental Law has shown that fossil-fuel companies are banking on the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fossils-Fertilizers-and-False-Solutions.pdf">expansion</a> of these markets.<strong> </strong>The industry “is eyeing the food system,” CIEL’s Lisa Tostado told us, “from inputs like pesticides and fertilizers to production and processing, as a dangerous escape hatch.” </p>
<p data-line-id="52a2321b0ff54ffa9a60dd40a0610ef7"> Finally, we’re also seeing a push to use more agricultural land for incredibly inefficient energy production. The United States already dedicates about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=105761">40%</a> of its corn harvest to ethanol fuels, which are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/">estimated</a> to be “at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline.” </p>
<p data-line-id="291a9269bc8f4a1d960d9ca940bd359c"> Given increased marketing of and demand for energy-intensive food, decoupling food production from fossil fuels is essential to meet our climate goals. Even if all governments delivered on their 2030 climate pledges, <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/">fossil-fuel use</a> in the food system alone would consume our remaining 1.5° Celsius carbon budget by 2037. </p>
<p data-line-id="32dba9075718414fa8533d31b574a168"> Fortunately, there are many ways to phase out fossil fuels in food systems. These include strategies to end the use of fossil-fuel-based fertilizers and pesticides, and to move away from input-dependent crop-based energy systems like corn ethanol; shifting to renewable energy for processing, cooling, and drying food; supporting minimally processed, less energy-intensive foods and encouraging plant-rich diets; and encouraging the uptake of seasonal, locally grown food. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc2e2c285b142c887ef9f2312832fa2"> Shifting away from industrial methods toward more sustainable ways of farming not only would protect the planet. It also would create jobs, improve health, protect biodiversity, and help address the roots of hunger. Evidence from around the world <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apcnf-tca-study_2023.pdf">shows</a> that approaches like agroecology and regenerative agriculture are effective in driving a shift away from fossil-fuel dependency. With these strategies, yields remain steady or improve, while emissions fall, farmworkers’ health improves, and biodiversity is protected. </p>
<p data-line-id="9ce6951f61014c40b15b25f2f05c01a1"> There is no technical barrier to shifting from dependence on synthetic inputs toward agroecological and regenerative food production, or to replacing fossil-fuel energy with renewable sources. But many governments offer very few subsidies to support these transitions, and many more incentivize business as usual. According to the OECD, every year between 2019 and 2021, public funds totaling <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/climatefinancereport-english.pdf">$528 billion</a> were channeled to agricultural and food-production practices that are generally bad for the climate, the environment, and human health. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a5d5b1c723e42f0a2c3abb0a34da506"> Now that we have come to understand just how endemic fossil-fuel usage is across our economies, we must take pains to ensure that <em>all</em> sectors are included in the transition to a fossil-fuel-free future. Despite COP28’s dubious staging in a petrostate, we are pleased to see food finally taking center stage. But that discussion must not be isolated from the one about ending the use of fossil fuels as fast as possible. There will be no food-systems transformation without phasing out fossil fuels, and there will be no phasing out fossil fuels without food-systems transformation. </p>

<p data-line-id="92c9be40e4bc4f4aa5fa9e040e411ba8"> LONDON – Nearly 30 years into global negotiations to address climate change, efforts to control the problem are lagging, reflecting stalled progress toward creating a sustainable trajectory more broadly. Each year of delay adds to the urgency of the problem, and of the need to maintain Earth’s resilience against the most severe effects of global warming. </p><p data-line-id="e17e191e2aa14631bd0673a1432ff5e9"> It has been 17 years since the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/the-economics-of-climate-change-the-stern-review/">Stern Review</a> alerted the world to the costs of inaction on climate change, and two years since the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review">Dasgupta Review</a> did the same for biodiversity and the ecological underpinnings of our economies. Now, a similar expert <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-water-crisis-new-economics-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2023-03">consensus</a> is emerging around water security. But most countries still do not seem to understand that neglecting water could undo the progress made on other fronts. We are facing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00800-z">global water crisis</a> that warrants the same level of attention, ambition, and action as the climate and biodiversity crises. </p><p data-line-id="d4a309acc5c049d1a240ec5b5b9ea9c7"> The links between the climate, biodiversity, and water crises point to a fundamental issue: our economies are based on flawed economics. Current economic thinking leads us to consider only the proceeds of pillaging of the planet, while ignoring externalities such as environmental damage and the liabilities they imply. This bad accounting makes us look wealthier when we are actually becoming poorer, depleting the sources of our well-being at the cost of future generations. </p>

<p data-line-id="3536dc9c23fe447caefa65e177bbf698"> DUBAI – Nation-states, presidents, and prime ministers – those are the players who garner the biggest headlines and the most media attention at each year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference. Yet for the past decade, and with far less fanfare, cities, states, and regional governments (known as “subnationals”) have been implementing the Paris climate agreement’s guidance, even when their national governments have not. This has meant investing in clean-energy systems and other urban innovations to reduce emissions locally, and sharing what works through networks like <a href="https://www.c40.org/about-c40/">C40</a> and the <a href="https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/">Global Covenant of Mayors</a> to accelerate progress on a larger scale. </p>
<p data-line-id="c566c5a192d945ff965fd1554ed2b719"> Fortunately, this year’s UN conference in Dubai (<a href="https://www.cop28.com/">COP28</a>) brings a historic first that bodes well for progress on climate change more broadly. The inaugural <a href="https://www.cop28.com/LCAS">Local Climate Action Summit</a> will bring mayors and governors together to engage directly with national and international leaders, demonstrating how cities are driving solutions and generating ideas that are being adopted around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="bc8073bdc63049fb8a7b1cfd9887c34c"> The timing for this breakthrough couldn’t be better. The UN recently released its <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/implementation-must-accelerate-to-increase-ambition-across-all-fronts-taking-an-all-of-society">first official report card</a> on the progress the world has made since COP15 in Paris. It shows that bolder and more urgent action is needed to hold global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the limit required to stave off the worst effects of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="32f38b51e50b42e2a4cfce50e95e2c39"> Cities like Freetown, which is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change (from extreme heat that rarely subsides to floods and landslides that come without warning), are determined to push world leaders to raise their ambitions – and to empower cities to do more to lead the way. </p>
<p data-line-id="6ec7243d38aa4605a0595d9a6806c43c"> Freetown has shown how cities can set an example through innovative action. When urbanization wiped out 70% of its trees, the city created a <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/winners-finalists/freetown-the-treetown/">program</a> to enlist residents in restoring green cover, which reduces the impact of severe heat. Freetown’s <a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C40_GYMF_Report4.pdf">young people</a> are a big part of the campaign to plant one million trees by 2024, and their engagement does not stop there. Young people are well represented on Freetown’s Community <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2011/en/bgdocs/hfa/16241_sle_NationalHFAprogress_2009-11.pdf">Disaster Management Committees</a> and have put their collective energy into the city’s Transform Freetown Agenda (of which the tree-planting is part). </p>
<p data-line-id="82918b710c8647b383e6f938ffad6e36"> Nor is Freetown alone. In the Philippines, Quezon City has created a network of <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-quezon-city/">sustainable urban gardens and farms</a> that addresses food insecurity among residents and reduces the emissions associated with traditional farming. In Lima, Peru, civic leaders have developed a <a href="https://interlace-hub.com/local-climate-change-plan-province-lima-peru#:~:text=The%20Local%20Climate%20Change%20Plan,prosperous,%20inclusive%20and%20resilient%20city.">climate-change plan</a> that not only aims to protect the area’s ecosystems, but also targets the small changes – park by park, orchard by orchard – that add up to large-scale improvements in the urban landscape. It has also launched a <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-lima/">highly successful effort</a> to monitor and improve air quality where the city’s children play, learn, and live. </p>
<p data-line-id="ec8f1649e10847ff887e36632efee37d"> In these and many other ways, cities are showing global leaders how real progress is made. But cities should not be seen only as models; they also should be treated as essential partners in the global effort to combat climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="2d06da3f1db44797b05fd9d200216f85"> This has not typically been the case. Even where national leaders have professed their belief in multilevel governance, policy frameworks are often indifferent to local and regional climate efforts, which leads them to overlook proven solutions. At COP28 and in the years ahead, local leaders should have an equal voice in the discussion and access to the resources they need to take decisive action. </p>
<p data-line-id="bb0ccd054efb4ffa9522ce4e285b4c2b"> A true partnership between national and subnational governments could be the key that unlocks a consistent flow of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-view-from-freetown-sierra-leone/">climate financing</a>. By working together, local and national leaders can exert considerably greater influence on global institutions, including the UN, multilateral development banks, and governments with the means to accelerate climate-finance solutions. </p>
<p data-line-id="e58d8ac77d6f4b18b0a3c475ef9eea1b"> The world’s mayors are increasingly coming together to deliver this message with a unified voice. Hence, in advance of the COP28 Local Climate Action Summit, C40 modernized its leadership model to include two, rather than just one, chair. The network is now co-chaired by the mayors of London and Freetown, an arrangement that better represents the insights and experiences of the world’s people. </p>
<p data-line-id="00b6eddb9f58426aa715ade5a7148ad2"> COP28 provides an opportunity to build on the leadership of London Mayor <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sadiq-khan">Sadiq Khan</a>, who, in his previous role as C40 Chair, helped ensure that <a href="https://www.c40.org/news/c40-announces-co-chair-model-london-freetown-mayors/#:~:text=As%20chair%20of%20C40%2C%20Sadiq,Air%20Fund%2C%20and%20C40%20Cities.">two-thirds</a> of the organization’s budget is dedicated to advancing climate action in the Global South, where the effects of climate are the most severe. </p>
<p data-line-id="7f096dcc65f94048b44cfd42162bcc7c"> Local leaders around the world are proving that when we join our strengths, pool our resources, and come together in a genuine spirit of partnership, local and national governments can achieve great progress and help safeguard the future. </p>

<p data-line-id="ef2070d81add4e2f9dfd00b8de8ce517"> STANFORD – Economists and policymakers agree that technological improvements are crucial to economic growth. The information technology (IT) revolution of the last four decades has driven the economy forward, and very few people would want to stop it. But since the 1980s, as that revolution has taken root, the US economy has experienced a sharp rise in firms’ market power, defined predominantly as their ability to affect pricing. </p><p data-line-id="d46ff412e40d4b9fa6e0f41f600d281a"> Rising productivity and rising market power are the twin outcomes of the innovation process. Both result from the private ownership of technology, and from the legal powers conferred by patents or trade secrets. When an innovation wave like the IT revolution takes off, market power rapidly accumulates and becomes a significant force, with profound economic and political implications. In my recent <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-market-power-of-technology/9780231206532">book</a>, I call this unique force the “<em>market power of technology</em>.” </p><p data-line-id="f57897beeae04ff4af31ecb731e9afa2"> Although economists have long recognized the dangers of such market power, the universal view has been that it is short-lived because competition will erode it, patents will expire, and trade secrets cannot be kept secret for long. Allowing innovators some market power thus has been considered a small price to pay for the great benefits of rising productivity. </p>

<p data-line-id="ff3bce6bfa20448aaf8efffa375cae35"> WARSAW – In October, Polish voters demonstrated that even extremely unequal elections against authoritarian incumbents can be won. The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-election-results-opposition-donald-tusk-wins-final-count-civic-platform-pis/">opposition’s victory</a>, and the country’s subsequent re-democratization, may hold useful lessons for likeminded forces in Hungary, Turkey, and elsewhere. </p><p data-line-id="23974fb2a3a54262b0c2930f2ee7e739"> In Poland, the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/polish-election-jaroslaw-kaczynski-defeated-lessons-for-democracy-by-jacek-rostowski-2023-11">defeated populist leader</a>, Jarosław Kaczyński of Law and Justice (PiS), is relearning the rules of democracy the hard way in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-president-swear-govt-opposition-condemns-farce-2023-11-27/">newly elected parliament</a>. For the past eight years, he did not entertain questions in the Sejm (the lower house of parliament) or elsewhere, nor did he engage with any media outlet that PiS did not control. The speaker of the Sejm, Elżbieta Witek, politely followed his instructions and even <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/04/07/polish-government-pushes-through-bill-allowing-may-elections-to-be-held-by-post/">reversed</a> votes that PiS had lost.

Press passes for journalists covering parliament were <a href="https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2016/12/18/polish-government-plans-to-restrict-journalists-access-to-parliament/">strictly limited</a>, and Kaczyński always entered through the speaker’s private entrance. </p>

<p data-line-id="bc847938ff0847a3ada5210706aceb3e"> NEW YORK – It is difficult to imagine the world without Henry Kissinger, not simply because he lived to be 100 years old, but because he occupied an influential – and sometimes dominant – place in American foreign policy and international relations for more than half a century. </p><p data-line-id="a6950d1fa1cc42cca05aa47f08c2af79"> Born in Germany in 1923, Kissinger immigrated to the United States in 1938, returned to Germany while in the US army, and then was a student and later a faculty member at Harvard University. He served for eight years in the US government, first as national security adviser, and then as secretary of state (holding both roles simultaneously between 1973 and 1975) under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. </p><p data-line-id="d82ec388a438443b88f123746d9e8616"> His accomplishments in office were many and substantial. For starters, there was the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/china/china-kissinger-tributes-old-friend-intl-hnk/index.html">opening to China</a>, an opportunity created by the Sino-Soviet split, but discerned and then exploited by Kissinger and Nixon to exert leverage over the Soviet Union (America’s principal adversary at the time). That diplomatic overture not only ended decades of hostility between the US and China. It also produced a formula for finessing differences over Taiwan, laid the foundation for China’s economic transformation, and established an enduring and ever-more important relationship. </p>

<p data-line-id="0838026307304732b06fab3a0ea92bbc"> BEIJING – In the two decades since China’s State Council officially classified the real-estate sector as a “<a href="https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-019-0101-5">pillar industry</a>,” the sector has undergone rapid development, propelling GDP growth and inspiring in millions of Chinese the dream of owning their own home. But the sector is now plagued by problems, from high prices to massive debts, and threatens to undermine growth at a time when China can ill afford it. </p><p data-line-id="350d1ffeb8994315a5ba49dc9dd76667"> Though there is no <a href="https://resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com/en/resources/global-corporate-real-estate-guide/asia-pacific/china/topics/real-estate-law#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20private%20%E2%80%9Cfreehold,to%20as%20%E2%80%9Ccollective%20land.%E2%80%9D">private land ownership</a> in China, households are eager to own their own homes, both to improve their living conditions and to accumulate wealth. Chinese cannot easily purchase foreign assets, owing to capital controls, and Chinese <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9c864c1-6cd4-405e-aa4b-d0b5e2ec6535">stock exchanges</a> have not been performing strongly. China does not tax residential real estate, capital gains, or inheritance – and promises major gains in value. As a result, property becomes the most attractive asset form to own. </p><p data-line-id="b554f63ef5c24034af1ceaad622e2616"> From 2005 to 2021, the real price index for residential property in China <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QCNR628BIS">increased by 28.5%</a>, from 87.95 to 112.99. While the price index has fallen a few times over the years, it has always rebounded strongly, giving Chinese the impression that, when it comes to wealth accumulation, home ownership is practically a sure thing. </p>

<p data-line-id="128d83d7d9184cdc94c1b1c2ee471b1c"> LJUBLJANA – “We must separate the Jews into two categories, the Zionists and the partisans of assimilation,” <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/NTx4AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyh7q0xuSCAxVhhf0HHdUxAT4Qre8FegQIHhAG">wrote</a> Reinhard Heydrich, one of the architects of the Holocaust, in 1935. “The Zionists profess a strictly racial concept and, through emigration to Palestine, they help to build their own Jewish State.…[O]ur good wishes and our official goodwill go with them.”  </p><p data-line-id="5d58a19d10e44f7ea1e41b2f7664b7d8"> In Heydrich’s terms, the creation of the State of Israel thus represented the triumph of Zionism over assimilationism. But it also complicated the traditional anti-Semitic perception of Jews as a deracinated, rootless people. This was Martin Heidegger’s <a href="https://www.klostermann.de/Heidegger-Martin-Ueberlegungen-XII-XV-Schwarze-Hefte-19391941">view</a>, in 1939, when he called for an examination of “Jewry’s predisposition to planetary criminality”: </p><p data-line-id="141395d1b51649b5b32b19b9013b6dfd"> “With their marked gift for calculation, the Jews ‘live’ according to the principle of race, and indeed have done so for the longest time, for which reason they themselves most vigorously resist its unrestricted application. The arrangement of racial breeding stems not from ‘life’ itself, but from the hyperempowerment of life by machination (<em>Machenschaft</em>). What this brings about with such planning is a <em>complete deracination</em> of peoples by harnessing them in a uniformly constructed and streamlined arrangement of all entities. Along with deracination goes a self-alienation of peoples – the loss of history – i.e., of the regions of decision for being (<em>Seyn</em>).” </p>

<p data-line-id="400be51d5af24e1cbf2cb56d3e751297"> NEW DELHI – Imagine a scenario where a private company effectively creates and controls its own jurisdiction within a sovereign country. This company introduces its own currency, enacts laws, and establishes courts, prisons, police forces, and even intelligence services. It formulates its own tax, labor, and environmental regulations (or lack thereof), regardless of their compatibility with national laws. </p><p data-line-id="e5b493b7e74742a9a450bcd14e4a0a75"> Now imagine that this company adopts bitcoin as its official currency and announces plans to privatize public services. It replaces the existing judicial system with an “arbitration center” and even introduces a fee-based citizenship model that requires signing a “social contract” designed to encourage good behavior. Eventually, the country’s democratically elected government steps in to stop this nonsense and affirm that national laws apply equally to this jurisdiction. But instead of complying, the company sues the government for billions of dollars, citing its projected financial losses. </p><p data-line-id="6b64160b003c433cabbf8b64d9c5c0b2"> This scenario, seemingly lifted straight out of a dystopian novel, is precisely what is happening today in Honduras. The Honduran government is currently contending with <a href="https://act.progressive.international/honduras/">seven international investor-state dispute settlement</a> (ISDS) claims filed by various private corporations. One US company based in Delaware, <a href="https://www.corpwatch.org/article/prospera-demands-honduras-pay-11-billion-outlawing-privately-run-city">Honduras Próspera</a>, is suing the country for a staggering <a href="https://www.lawg.org/the-zedes-law-in-honduras-sanctuary-for-exploitation-corruption-and-organized-crime/">$10.7 billion</a>, which represents two-thirds of the government’s projected budget for 2023. </p>

<p data-line-id="66fee53516ad459b88fc092f598743bc"> BONN – The world stands at a critical juncture in the fight against climate change. Either we drastically accelerate the clean-energy transition, or our fast-dwindling chances of preventing global temperatures from surpassing 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels will be destroyed. Few understand the stakes better than Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="485225539ec442d6a644187b5c25346d"> These countries comprise one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. In the last year alone, the LAC region endured a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/2023-atlantic-hurricane-season-ranks-4th-for-most-named-storms-in-year">destructive hurricane season</a>, a deadly heat wave, and severe drought, which produced an acute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/15/drought-leaves-millions-in-uruguay-without-tap-water-fit-for-drinking">water crisis</a> in Uruguay and undermined <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-send-energy-drought-stricken-ecuador-2023-10-29/">hydropower production</a> in countries like Ecuador. The credit-ratings agency Moody’s estimates that climate change could cost the equivalent of <a href="https://www.economy.com/economicview/analysis/394150/Latin-America-Under-the-Risk-of-Climate-Change">16% of the region’s GDP</a> this century. </p>
<p data-line-id="62c523ddf29f45eba605be6510086c2d"> But LAC countries also have vast potential to lead – and even propel – the global renewable-energy transition. As the International Energy Agency points out in its first <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/latin-america-energy-outlook-2023"><em>Latin America Energy Outlook</em></a>, renewables, led by hydropower, already account for 60% of the region’s electricity – twice the global average – and some of the world’s most robust wind and solar resources imply room for further growth. Latin America also possesses huge reserves of critical minerals vital to the clean-energy transition, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/20/why-crashing-lithium-prices-will-not-make-electric-cars-cheaper">more than half</a> of the world’s lithium. And it is positioned to become a leader in the production and use of green hydrogen. </p>
<p data-line-id="64652c1c8eb147e8839b7ca04957423d"> Moving onto a climate-safe trajectory will require radical, decisive, and immediate action, underpinned by global collaboration, strong political leadership, effective public-private partnerships, and well-designed regulatory frameworks. It will also require money: according to the IEA, the region must double renewable-energy investment by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="9166baad5dad4c51a31ae4a2431d9c00"> This investment would deliver energy access to the approximately 17 million people currently living without electricity; avert 30,000 premature deaths through clean cooking; and create one million jobs in clean-energy industries. But, like any socioeconomic transformation, the clean-energy transition risks leaving some groups behind, with women, rural communities, and indigenous people most at risk. To avoid this outcome, climate initiatives – and the goals that underpin them – must reflect principles of justice and inclusivity. </p>
<p data-line-id="f108fa4a68b34a7194d64928300facb2"> The energy transition depends on infrastructure. Latin America’s existing energy infrastructure has been built largely to support the production and consumption of oil and gas. To facilitate the development, storage, distribution, and transmission of renewables, the region now must build more interconnected grids and expand supportive infrastructure on land and at sea. Greater cross-border connectivity and scalable storage systems are essential to ensure that renewables-based systems across Latin America can withstand the worsening effects of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="49258b6e6a2e4534bb149c693d3e5149"> Costa Rica offers a model for how this can be done. The country is undergoing a profound transformation across every facet of its economy in an effort to become the world’s <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/costa-ricas-commitment-path-becoming-carbon-neutral">first carbon-neutral country</a> by 2050. In 2020, the Inter-American Development Bank modeled over 3,000 potential futures for Costa Rica and found that it would meet or almost meet its net-zero ambitions in <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA600/RRA633-1/RAND_RRA633-1.pdf">over 75% of them</a> – in nearly half, it predicted that the country would go even further, reaching net-negative emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c25bcc0d0bb4f0285babdb3bfebb275"> Other LAC countries are similarly well-placed to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, decarbonize their economies, and enhance their energy security. To this end, they should be developing their renewable-energy capabilities and working to boost energy efficiency. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero is helping here by working with local financial institutions to <a href="https://www.gfanzero.com/latin-america-and-caribbean-network/">bolster climate finance</a> in the region – an example of how public-private partnerships can help deliver sustainability and prosperity for all. </p>
<p data-line-id="28ee325f84d04dc1815203688df29d5e"> Of course, strategies will differ across countries. In the Caribbean, the climate, geography, and topography complicate the generation and transfer of renewable energy. <a href="https://www.carboncollective.co/sustainable-investing/distributed-generation-dg">Distributed generation</a> – meaning that electricity is generated near the point of use – is one way to overcome these challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="7b4b377b8e4e4e5ebdc4e52c377a8c32"> The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet has already begun deploying this technology in the region. In Haiti, for example, GEAPP is supporting the <a href="https://www.energyalliance.org/project-case-study/geapp-alina-eneji-haiti/">creation of mesh grids</a> – decentralized modular grids that enable households to generate most of the energy they consume with solar panels but are also connected to their neighbors in power-sharing clusters. By combining the simplicity, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of solar home systems with the resilience of a grid, mesh grids can deliver cost-effective energy access in remote areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="ed2b29c748914b5aa7b2f5ac2b50b269"> Battery energy storage systems – rechargeable batteries that can store energy from different sources – are another important technological solution. By helping to stabilize the electricity grid and ensure a reliable power supply during the energy transition, BESS can help countries to reach their renewable-energy goals while boosting their economies and lifting people out of generational poverty. Already, the global BESS market is on track to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/enabling-renewable-energy-with-battery-energy-storage-systems">double in size</a> by 2030. GEAPP’s <a href="https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/geapp-glc-accelerate-affordable-clean-energy-for-all/">BESS Consortium</a> is working to ensure that the benefits of this technology are felt across all income levels. </p>
<p data-line-id="9a4b8a1e834f4fad92b0c0b1078b150a"> The journey to a sustainable future will be a long one, involving continuous investment and innovation. New energy-storage solutions, together with enhanced regional connectivity, will form the backbone of robust, resilient, and modern energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, as LAC countries recognize, projects will have to be designed and implemented with social justice and the inclusion of indigenous communities in mind. </p>
<p data-line-id="7585ac6c814248908d3af64687b5e581"> The LAC region is committed both to mitigating climate change and ensuring climate justice. With effective public-private partnerships and concerted investments that support a strong supply chain, the region can achieve the energy revolution that its people – and the world – need. </p>

<p data-line-id="2c6150ff8306491f8da02bcf47c830a8"> BOSTON – These are unique and troubling times for the United States. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/09/politics/analysis-donald-trump-indictment/index.html">twice-impeached</a> former president who now faces <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictments-details-guide-charges-trial-dates-people-case/">four separate indictments</a> for serious crimes is the de facto leader of one of the two main political parties. Having remade the Republican Party in his image, Donald Trump will almost certainly be its nominee in the 2024 presidential election, despite mounting evidence of his financial misdeeds and role in an attempted coup. While Democrats <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/elections-2023-democrats-enjoy-a-strong-night/">fared well</a> in various elections this month, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-matchup/index.html">polls</a> show Trump leading US President Joe Biden in key battleground states. Clearly, something is rotten in the American Republic. </p><p data-line-id="d6f56131c0434b8dbb2afd9902203aed"> A second Trump presidency would be a much greater threat to democracy than the first. Trump’s own outlook and rhetoric suggest that he has been radicalized further, and his supporters have now learned from their failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Friendly think tanks are drawing up plans to dismantle the US government’s checks and balances, allowing Trump to usher in a police state targeting his political opponents. The Heritage Foundation’s <a href="https://www.project2025.org/playbook/">Project 2025</a> aims to “create a playbook of actions to be taken in the first 180 days of the new administration to bring quick relief to Americans suffering from the left’s devastating policies.” Central to that effort will be to staff key positions with Trumpian cadres. </p><p data-line-id="49bd5f6f1cca4489a0576cad057f8498"> While Trump and his enablers in the political establishment obviously bear the blame for this dire state of affairs, so do the American left and the fact-based media, which have failed to develop a well-calibrated response. Reactions vary from implicit normalization (who can deny a major party’s choice of nominee?) to showing zero tolerance toward Trump’s supporters. But a practical blueprint for addressing the situation is missing, even though the future of American democracy is at stake. </p>

<p data-line-id="6a610f15a7d44d978e6fab842b1a9020"> CAMBRIDGE – In the run-up to 2023, the outlook for the global economy appeared bleak. Analysts predicted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in energy prices would trigger a significant economic downturn in Europe. Bloomberg Economics <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-17/forecast-for-us-recession-within-year-hits-100-in-blow-to-biden?sref=4rOwJ71Y">proclaimed</a> that there was a 100% probability that the United States would suffer a recession. Few believed that most developing economies could withstand the combination of rising energy prices, soaring interest rates, and a downturn in developed countries. </p><p data-line-id="e15bbea39e22431483adccc73de8f367"> Had forecasters anticipated the war between Israel and Hamas and its potential for regional escalation, the intensification of the Russia-Ukraine war, and political turbulence in some Western countries, their pessimism would have been even more pronounced. Moreover, the extraordinary <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-07/what-us-treasury-volatility-means-for-the-economy">volatility</a> in the US Treasury market, a key benchmark for numerous domestic and international markets, would have fueled fears about a looming global recession, as would have US bank failures. </p><p data-line-id="05a6b8d5a90a429aba51b66171e41f91"> But while the past year’s unforeseen political, geopolitical, and market upheavals <em>should</em> have further dampened the world’s growth outlook, the global economy surprised on the upside. The vast majority of developed economies defied expectations, successfully avoiding economic contraction. Developing countries as a whole avoided financial distress. Even China, despite its disappointing growth, showcased the resilience of its economy as the year drew to a close. </p>

<p data-line-id="e734e74258534550b9a4c2679c88dbf5"> HONG KONG – Last month, China held its first <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-finance-jinping-property-479d4914e2596c0e659b33ff39b74252">Central Financial Work Conference</a> – the highest-level review of the financial sector that the Communist Party of China (CPC) conducts – since 2017. Given that China’s financial sector includes the world’s <a href="https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-06/24/content_5697438.htm">largest</a> banking system by <a href="http://camlmac.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4820197/index.html">assets</a> ($53.1 trillion) – and the <a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/InvestChinaA/document/understandingchinaa.pdf">second-largest</a> (after the United States) by stock-market capitalization – and that the full Politburo Standing Committee attends the conference, the decisions made, and even the tone struck, have global implications. </p><p data-line-id="bdf0522861c542639db156e03cb80151"> The <a href="https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202310/content_6912992.htm">report</a> released after the conference confirmed that the CPC’s fundamental view of the financial sector has not changed. For China’s leaders, the fundamental function of finance is to serve the real economy, and the government is responsible for maintaining stability, managing risks, and promoting homegrown innovation and high-quality development. </p><p data-line-id="579fd34dc1ac4b2ab87913ccdded058b"> But the focus of the discussions shifted significantly since 2017, when the main priority was managing the imbalances arising from shadow banking, local-government spending, and real-estate excesses. All of the risks in these domains had been exacerbated by the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus that China’s government implemented in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. </p>

<p data-line-id="621c8da93a824afd8b4db7346254f953"> DUBAI – It has become increasingly clear from the vast array of information on climate change that advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals is an essential part of any long-term solution to the crisis. Although the loosely defined concept remains a work in progress, the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai provides an opportunity for business leaders and policymakers to agree on how ESG can best contribute to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. </p>
<p data-line-id="699f2fdd19fa4c24931edfb495aeecb1"> Sound ESG strategies that focus on robust standards, clear metrics, and strict compliance procedures can improve the investment decision-making process for firms in all sectors. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to unlock debt and equity financing, while also yielding reputational returns. </p>
<p data-line-id="27d07fce184a457c869ea5076c3fd12d"> Beyond offering substantial benefits, ESG has become a business imperative. As the global race to achieve net-zero emissions intensifies, firms looking to form new alliances and partnerships must be able to outline their ESG strategy and, crucially, explain how they plan to execute it. This makes it even more important to develop a cohesive, equitable, and transparent approach to ESG at COP28 and secure buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders. </p>
<p data-line-id="ffcbc4f801ef4f2c99ee5855574c4a5d"> ESG has gained significant momentum in the Middle East in the run-up to COP28: nearly two-thirds of regional organizations <a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/esg/survey.html">surveyed</a> by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) earlier this year reported adopting a formal ESG strategy in the last 12 months. This would have been unimaginable only a few years ago, when very few in the region were taking the concept seriously. And the trend looks set to continue, as 66% of survey respondents want their CEO and board to allocate more time to ESG-related issues. </p>
<p data-line-id="600dd95b03f04079af9eae9d3144083a"> Moreover, the fact that 40% of respondents hope that COP28 will lead to governments improving ESG infrastructure and providing incentives for green growth underscores the significance of the climate summit. Fortunately, the United Arab Emirates is already spearheading the reform effort, building awareness of how an ESG framework can pave the way to a net-zero economy. On the environmental side, the UAE has announced plans to invest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/uae-plans-to-invest-54-billion-in-renewables-in-net-zero-push">$54 billion</a> in renewables over the next seven years and has pledged <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-05/uae-pledges-4-5-billion-to-help-finance-africa-climate-projects#xj4y7vzkg">$4.5 billion</a> to finance climate projects in Africa. Mobilizing these huge sums ahead of COP28, as well as undertaking major initiatives to support <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/markets/2023/02/09/strong-pipeline-of-green-bonds-likely-from-middle-east-in-2023-sp-says/">social and governance investments</a>, demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to championing ESG at the summit and beyond. </p>
<p data-line-id="099bbf19bc6c49daa069e5acc7929c44"> Banks must also do their part, which means raising awareness of the central role that ESG plays in sustainable finance and ensuring that there are enough green financial products – including <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/islamic-finances-answer-sdgs-and-climate-change">Sharia-compliant instruments</a> – to meet soaring demand from customers. They should also improve ESG reporting metrics to streamline internal and sector-wide data collection. While such changes take time, a more immediate fix could be improving in-house training to help staff better incorporate ESG factors into investment decisions and overall bank strategy. </p>
<p data-line-id="f779605d21884d5cbc3235a51310722e"> A meaningful shift in resource management is already underway. Today, 27% of Middle Eastern companies responding to the PwC survey have a chief sustainability officer, and almost half of those individuals are primarily responsible for ESG. Relatedly, only 20% of respondents this year said that the CEO had overall control of ESG, down from around 55% last year. Corporate leaders across the region are clearly attaching more importance to these principles. </p>
<p data-line-id="1bd6dc4bbf984921bc594fb7b95c886b"> While large corporations will find it easier to navigate the increasingly complex framework of green financing, small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) will require more support and should not be an afterthought – especially in the UAE economy. According to <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/business/small-and-medium-enterprises/small-and-medium-enterprises">government data</a> published in mid-2022, the country is home to 557,000 SMEs, which account for 63.5% of non-oil GDP, and that number could grow to one million by 2030. If ESG is to be successful, it must become a key component of business for companies of all sizes. </p>
<p data-line-id="956da24a9fac415fa884ed6a2684fc7a"> Global warming represents an existential threat, but the magnitude of the challenge has given rise to unprecedented dynamism: governments and business leaders are embracing new frameworks and radical measures to ensure rapid and significant progress on climate action. COP28 in Dubai will only accelerate this process, especially when it comes to building a consensus on ESG implementation. Speed is of the essence, because the sooner companies begin incorporating ESG into their investment decisions, the better they will do – both economically and environmentally – on the path to net-zero emissions. </p>

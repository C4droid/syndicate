<p data-line-id="3dab3d4bb9944e6085e1cfe89dd2b678"> BRUSSELS – Dozens of countries around the world, from the United States to India, will hold or have already held elections in 2024. While this may seem like a banner year for democracy, these elections are taking place against a backdrop of global economic instability, geopolitical shifts, and intensifying climate change, leading to widespread uncertainty. </p><p data-line-id="60e127d725754821bd66d7a7f3c3ff7c"> Underpinning all this uncertainty is the rapid emergence of powerful new technologies, some of which are already reshaping markets and recalibrating global power dynamics. While they have the potential to solve global problems, they could also disrupt economies, endanger civil liberties, and undermine democratic governance. As Thierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/geopolitics-technology-thierry-breton/">observed</a>, “We have entered a global race in which the mastery of technologies is central” to navigating the “new geopolitical order.” </p><p data-line-id="22a8b24b4f1045ccb58059635bb2fd09"> To be sure, technological disruption is not a new phenomenon. What sets today’s emerging technologies apart is that they have reached a point where even their creators struggle to understand them. </p><p data-line-id="3a984e58af34498b96772f17d107514f"> Consider, for example, generative artificial intelligence. The precise mechanisms by which large language models like Google’s Gemini (formerly known as Bard) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT generate responses to user prompts are still not fully understood, even by their own developers. </p><p data-line-id="bfc8f01d51074c2789f9c2e089f8abe5"> What we do know is that AI and other rapidly advancing technologies, such as quantum computing, biotechnology, neurotechnology, and climate-intervention tech, are growing increasingly powerful and influential by the day. Despite the scandals and the political and regulatory backlash of the past few years, Big Tech firms are still among the world’s largest companies and continue to shape our lives in myriad ways, for better or worse. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9bf7907b35c54d3090e4f78b07d01873"> Moreover, over the past 20 years, a handful of tech giants have invested heavily in development and acquisitions, amassing wealth and talent that empowers them to capture new markets before potential competitors emerge. Such concentration of innovation power enables these few players to maintain their market dominance – and to call the shots on how their technologies are developed and used worldwide. Regulators have scrambled to enact societal safeguards for increasingly powerful, complex technologies, and the public-private knowledge gap is growing. </p><p data-line-id="51c7dfee7396433fac5af94abd3fd6cd"> For example, in addition to developing vaccines and early detection systems to trace the spread of viruses, bioengineers are developing new tools to engineer cells, organisms, and ecosystems, leading to new medicines, crops, and materials. Neuralink is working on trials with chip implants in the bodies of disabled people, and on enhancing the speed at which humans communicate with systems through direct brain-computer interaction. Meanwhile, quantum engineers are developing supercomputers that could potentially break existing encryption systems crucial for cybersecurity and privacy. Then there are the climate technologists who are increasingly open to radical options for curbing global warming, despite a dearth of real-world research into the side effects of global interventions like solar radiation management. </p><p data-line-id="08ea3148ab0f4c8386b8dd9dd5fe74b3"> While these developments hold great promise, applying them recklessly could lead to irreversible harm. The destabilizing effect of unregulated social media on political systems over the past decade is a prime example. Likewise, absent appropriate safeguards, the biotech breakthroughs we welcome today could unleash new pandemics tomorrow, whether from accidental lab leaks or deliberate weaponization. </p><p data-line-id="f06c619d32a0474ebde64849f7d50935"> Regardless of whether one is excited by the possibilities of technological innovation or concerned about potential risks, the unique characteristics, corporate power, and global scale of these technologies require guardrails and oversight. These companies’ immense power and global reach, together with the potential for misuse and unintended consequences, underscore the importance of ensuring that these powerful systems are used responsibly and in ways that benefit society. </p><p data-line-id="9a4288ac3d3b4d76ad7725bbae64a5e5"> Here, governments face a seemingly impossible task: they must oversee systems that are not fully understood by their creators while also trying to anticipate future breakthroughs. To navigate this dilemma, policymakers must deepen their understanding of how these technologies function, as well as the interplay between them. </p><p data-line-id="53cd87a7b4794ff1a898b40f8d112b95"> To this end, regulators must have access to independent information. As capital, data, and knowledge become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few corporations, it is crucial to ensure that decision-makers are able to access policy-oriented expertise that enables them to develop fact-based policies that serve the public interest. Democratic leaders need policy-oriented expertise about emerging technology – not lobbyists’ framings. </p><p data-line-id="8468f165903c4d1396de6df082fcfbaf"> Having adopted a series of important laws like the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">AI Act</a> over the past few years, the EU is uniquely positioned to govern emerging technologies on the basis of solid rule of law, rather than in service of corporate profits. But first, European policymakers must keep up with the latest technological advances. It is time for EU decision-makers to get ahead of the next curve. They must educate themselves on what exactly is happening at the cutting edge. Waiting until new technologies are introduced to the market is waiting too long. </p><p data-line-id="ded7e684a580413f9f01914712fe6ed5"> Governments must learn from past challenges and actively steer technological innovation, prioritizing democratic principles and positive social impact over industry profits. As the global order comes under increasing strain, political leaders must look beyond the ballot box and focus on mitigating the long-term risks posed by emerging technologies. </p>

<p data-line-id="7c4c2c54ee594195baa5c24e89f25a16"> HANOI – For over a decade now, China has been working stealthily to alter the territorial and maritime status quo in the Indo-Pacific – an effort that has increasingly stoked tensions with regional neighbors like Australia, India, Japan, Taiwan, and several Southeast Asian countries, as well as the United States. And with US attention and resources focused on conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, China has lately become even more aggressive in its expansionism. Chinese regional hegemony is closer than ever. </p><p data-line-id="a26406f85eaf47d98048e55a25896b94"> Almost daily, China finds a new way to <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-policy-of-engagement-with-china-making-taiwan-crisis-more-likely-by-brahma-chellaney-2024-02">bully Taiwan</a>, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly pledged to “reunify” with the mainland (though that objective has <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2024/02/26/2003814078">no basis</a> in international law or history).

<p data-line-id="9bc9cec5900348ec826d115e8a3e3ba3"> BRATISLAVA – Central and Eastern European (CEE) governments have long prided themselves on their tough migration policies. Over the past decades, many of the region’s political leaders have focused their efforts on curbing the flow of migrants and asylum seekers, contending that an influx of third-country nationals would undermine social stability, threaten cultural cohesion, and even pose a security risk. </p><p data-line-id="6049aa4d9d9a4dfd9a5bd91cf0542bf5"> For example, in 2015, at the height of the European Union’s migration crisis, the four Visegrád (V4) countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) vehemently <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/refugee-crisis-european-court-of-justice-rejects-quota-challenge/a-40375192">opposed</a> the bloc’s refugee-quota system, which aimed to share the burden by allocating a certain number of asylum seekers to each EU country based on population, GDP, and other factors. Hungary and Slovakia were among the most vocal critics of the plan, arguing that mandatory quotas were an attack on national sovereignty. </p><p data-line-id="89a292ed444943e1b61571560ee77596"> To be sure, CEE countries – most notably, Poland and the Czech Republic – <a href="https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/CESifo-Forum-2022-4-aslund-ukrainian-refugee-crisis-july.pdf">welcomed millions of Ukrainians</a> driven out of their homes by the Russian invasion in 2022. But despite this generosity, V4 leaders have continued to take a tough line on migration. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/religions/article/2023/04/29/how-viktor-orban-went-from-being-an-agnostic-liberal-to-a-defender-of-christian-values_6024781_63.html">self-declared champion</a> of Europe’s Christian values – <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/orban-calls-ethnic-homogeneity-a-key-to-success/">promotes a vision</a> of a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hungary-orban-mixed-race-society-racism-backlash-rcna40583">homogeneous Hungarian society</a>. Hungary granted refugee status to only <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/migration/news/double-game-migrants-pour-through-orbans-hungary/">ten individuals</a> in 2022, earning a rebuke from the EU’s top court. In Slovakia, Prime Minister Robert Fico’s left-populist Smer-Social Democracy party won last year’s election by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aea63b5f-6169-4db3-935d-deb09214dabc">exploiting resentment</a> against Ukrainian refugees. And the region recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-interior-ministers-migration-hungary-78fa8ebff89711b751257d81a1a63fb3">stepped up efforts</a> to stop illegal immigration through the Balkans by introducing stricter controls and deploying security forces to patrol borders. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4afcd04ef7742eaac3062e1f81afc46"> AUCKLAND/RIGA/LONDON – If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that no one is safe anywhere until everyone is safe everywhere, and that delivering global safety is possible only through collaboration. It was with this in mind that the World Health Organization’s 194 member countries decided in December 2021 to <a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/inb/pdf_files/inb5/A_INB5_6-en.pdf">negotiate</a> a convention, agreement, or other international instrument that would support pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response globally. With the deadline for those negotiations approaching fast – the “pandemic accord” is supposed to be delivered in time for the 77th World Health Assembly in May – it is worth considering what is at stake. </p><p data-line-id="603df792bd084b6397b362b4eccb5a42"> A pandemic accord is critical to safeguard our collective future. Only a strong global pact on pandemics can protect future generations from a repeat of the COVID-19 crisis, which led to millions of deaths and caused widespread social and economic devastation, owing not least to insufficient international collaboration. </p><p data-line-id="1438e57a52e047c0b56fb12e5e933647"> But the global effort to deliver such an accord is being threatened by <a href="https://betterworldcampaign.org/other-issues/who-pandemic-accord">misinformation and disinformation</a>. Among the falsehoods that have been circulating is the claim that the pandemic accord would enable the WHO to exert far-reaching authority over countries and their citizens during a public-health emergency.  </p><p data-line-id="75ecd3aa32044aeb93401f111e147099"> Some allege, for example, that the WHO could require the adoption of digital vaccine passports that would enable it to monitor – and control – people’s movements. Others say that it would interfere in matters of national sovereignty. There are even some who worry that the WHO would deploy armed forces to enforce vaccination orders and lockdowns. </p><p data-line-id="c56122f5d26342939b12dc2f903fcd6b"> All of these claims are wholly false. For starters, the deployment of a WHO-led armed force to ensure compliance would fall well outside the organization’s mandate. Moreover, while the pandemic accord is a global pact, individual countries are spearheading it. Sovereign countries proposed it, are negotiating it, will determine what is in it, and will decide whether it succeeds or fails. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="32f791e300a34a318d52ef4ca90e3aef"> Countries are doing this not because of some dictum from the WHO – like the negotiations, participation in any instrument would be entirely voluntary – but because they need what the accord can and must offer. In fact, a pandemic accord would deliver vast and universally shared benefits, including greater capacity to detect new and dangerous pathogens, access to information about pathogens detected elsewhere in the world, and timely and equitable delivery of tests, treatments, vaccines, and other lifesaving tools. </p><p data-line-id="e0319a5995fb4029b8c72c21131166f6"> As countries enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, governments must work to refute and debunk false claims about the accord. At the same time, negotiators must ensure that the agreement lives up to its promise to prevent and mitigate pandemic-related risks. This requires, for example, provisions aimed at ensuring that when another pandemic threat does arise, all relevant responses – from reporting the identification of risky pathogens to delivering tools like tests and vaccines on an equitable basis – are implemented quickly and effectively. As the COVID-19 pandemic showed, collaboration between the public and private sectors focused on advancing the public good is also essential. </p><p data-line-id="ae97cc27c310428892eec3b3313a1b91"> A new pandemic threat will emerge; there is no excuse not to be ready for it. It is thus imperative to build an effective, multisectoral, and multilateral approach to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Given the unpredictable nature of public-health risks, a global strategy must embody a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. There is no time to waste, which is why we are calling on all national leaders to redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline. </p><p data-line-id="476479c6f8604ab69424969fecfacafd"> Beyond protecting countless lives and livelihoods, the timely delivery of a global pandemic accord would send a powerful message: even in our fractured and fragmented world, international cooperation can still deliver global solutions to global problems. </p><p data-line-id="e38b2cfd34094f2c86ea26f4f268d47b"><em>This commentary is signed by Carlos Alvarado, President of Costa Rica (2018-22); Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile (2006-10); Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister of the Netherlands (2002-10); Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; Joyce Banda, President of Malawi (2012-14); Kjell Magne Bondevik, Prime Minister of Norway (1997-2000, 2001-05); Kim Campbell, Prime Minister of Canada (1993); Alfred Gusenbauer, Chancellor of Austria (2007-08); Seung-Soo Han, Prime Minister of South Korea (2009-09); Mehdi Jomaa, Prime Minister of Tunisia (2014-15); Horst Köhler, President of Germany (2004-10); Rexhep Meidani, President of Albania (1997-2002); Mario Monti, Prime Minister of Italy (2011-13); Francisco Sagasti, President of Peru (2020-21); Jenny Shipley, Prime Minister of New Zealand (1997-99); Juan Somavía, former Director of the International Labour Organization; Micheline Calmy-Rey, former President of the Swiss Confederation; Baroness Lynda Chalker, former Minister of Overseas Development, UK; Chester A.

<p data-line-id="ddc3cc7d662d4f78a0caed998256455d"> NEW YORK – On March 8, the United Nations Security Council <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147432">passed a resolution</a> calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the holy month of Ramadan. It also urged all parties to the conflict to ensure the rapid and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including to protect civilians. </p><p data-line-id="62f4cae0d4144eb4945737d8835bcf08"> The violent conflict, which erupted last April following a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/15/army-and-rival-forces-clash-as-power-struggle-rocks-sudan">standoff</a> between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a powerful paramilitary group, has since <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2024/02/19/sudan-collapse-international-community-we-are-failing-it">engulfed</a> more than half the country. Nearly a year later, the Security Council’s push for a ceasefire and the free flow of aid is an essential step forward, following increasingly <a href="https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20231218/auc-chairperson-renews-call-end-conflict-sudan">urgent</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-war-guterres-generals-icc-atrocities-fffe37935dacf91287f001a8696488c3">calls</a> for an immediate halt to the fighting from the African Union and UN Secretary-General <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a>. Now, policymakers must translate words into action. </p><p data-line-id="42091919dfb84808adb56b6cb75219d7"> The situation in Sudan is catastrophic. Half the population – <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/press-releases/sudan-conflict-fuels-epic-suffering-un-launches-humanitarian-and-refugee">25 million people</a> – are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. According to the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146167">UN World Food Programme</a>, nearly 18 million people are facing acute hunger – more than double this time last year – and must make impossible decisions to feed themselves, while nearly five million (equivalent to the population of Ireland) are on the brink of famine. Since the conflict began, more than <a href="https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan/">eight million people</a> have been displaced. In December, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity-and-ethnic-cleansing-determination-in-sudan/">issued a determination</a> that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing were occurring in Sudan, evoking ominous echoes of the Darfur genocide. </p>

Beyond failing to encourage new market entrants, it seems to have entrenched the dominance of incumbents. Moreover, it has severely undermined investor confidence, leading to a substantial reduction in capital flows into the consumer-tech sector. </p><p data-line-id="1c82f267ca9c4c6c967697f0c2c08975">As private entities recede, the state advances. For example, government-backed funds or companies acquire stakes in key subsidiaries of tech giants; these “golden shares” enable the government to exert more control over content moderation and other business decisions. Finally, the crackdown has enabled the state to steer investment within the technology sector, leading both private and state-backed investors increasingly to focus on so-called <a href="https://www.mhubchicago.com/blog/what-is-hardtech">hard tech</a>.</p>

<p data-line-id="6cdac0ad06d644639e85b5596d812466"> SAN DIEGO – If John D. Rockefeller were around today, he’d be screwing a Google Nest – the pioneering smart thermostat – into the wall of his home. The notoriously thrifty oil baron would have jumped at the chance to save on his monthly energy bill. </p>
<p data-line-id="10dfcd935b19403da46b03786013d741"> Traditional energy companies, from ExxonMobil (the direct descendent of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company) to local utilities, have begun to embrace Big Tech, brimming with both hope and trepidation. Will companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta put the meter reader and his bosses out to pasture? Who wins if they do? </p>
<p data-line-id="f94a803711fe408aa3c56613d6256f72"> Big Tech has already shown a propensity to disrupt. Just 25 years ago, a “<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/on-google-s-22nd-birthday-learn-how-the-name-came-from-word-googol-1726205-2020-09-28#:~:text=The%20name%20Google%20came%20from,number%20that%20had%20100%20zeros.">googol</a>” – the inspiration for the search engine’s name – was an unfathomably large number, a cloud was a billowing puff in the sky, and 5G was the row in which you parked your car at the garage. In the intervening decades, tech companies have upended industries both at the enterprise and retail levels. </p>
<p data-line-id="1ba92b26a8a943d28638fe90222745fa"> Consider pharmacies, which relied on the patience of shoppers to wait days for a prescription and stand in queues to retrieve them. Now companies like <a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss">Hims</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss">Hers</a> will confidentially overnight drugs to calm your nerves, grow your hair, or put you in the mood. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/amazon-closes-39b-buy-of-one-medical/643245/#:~:text=Amazon%20completed%20its%20%243.9%20billion,addition%20of%20physical%20medical%20clinics.">One Medical</a>, which Amazon purchased last year, offers 24-hour on-demand virtual care and same- and next-day appointments – quite a feat considering the average wait time to see a physician in major American cities is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/30/medical-appointments-avoiding-long-waits/">more than three weeks</a>. No wonder the profit margins of brick-and-mortar drugstores have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/22/drugstore-close-pharmacy-deserts/">fallen</a>, plunging Rite-Aid into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rite-pharmacy-bankruptcy-f80c3d231946d675b03e4e797f627fa6">bankruptcy</a>. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="a36e4a6c32e0437aba13e474f173a35e"> Just as the world needs better access to medical care, it also needs more efficient and reliable power. Too many people are sitting in the dark too often, and for too long. Even in developed countries like the United States, the average duration of a blackout doubled <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/increasing-power-outages-dont-hit-everyone-equally1/">between 2013 and 2021</a>, from 3.5 hours to more than seven hours, while their frequency jumped by nearly 20%. Not surprisingly, Americans are taking a dimmer view of their local utilities, with 71% saying they would <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/electric-power-and-natural-gas/our-insights/the-digital-utility-new-opportunities-and-challenges">switch</a> providers, while businesses complain that power outages cost them <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/department-energy-report-explores-us-advanced-small-modular-reactors-boost-grid">$150 billion</a> per year. </p>
<p data-line-id="a51056c4b2fe43b59b291536b0fd7ab0"> That doesn’t mean utilities deserve all the blame. In the US, local and state politicians and regulators dictate profits and prices, while delaying capital upgrades. The US Department of Energy spends around five years assessing a new project before approval, leaving roughly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/06/outdated-us-energy-grid-tons-of-clean-energy-stuck-waiting-in-line.html">2,000 gigawatts</a> of annual capacity waiting in the queue. </p>
<p data-line-id="b88402f702324c2db526a412bb92ffb0"> Fast-growing trillion-dollar tech companies cannot afford to lose power, so they are taking matters into their own hands. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-renewable-energy-portfolio-january-2024-update">clean-energy portfolio</a>, which comprises solar and wind projects in more than 20 US states and 27 countries, is now big enough to power 7.2 million American homes each year. In Nevada’s Blue Mountain geothermal field, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/">partnering</a> with clean-energy start-up Fervo to power the tech behemoth’s data centers by tapping the heat trapped below Jurassic rocks. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c3be64a5ca84b22afed995b76a22872"> Unlike a utility saddled with old plants that need to be decommissioned, tech companies can start anew. The average age of an oil-burning steam-turbine plant in the Midwest is <a href="https://www.powermag.com/americas-aging-generation-fleet/">pushing 70 years</a>. In fact, Whiting, Wisconsin, runs a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydropower/">hydropower facility</a> built in 1891 – 40 years before actor Boris Karloff was hooked up to lightning-conducting electrodes in the original <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021884/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4"><em>Frankenstein</em></a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="b01ffe5b766249f69faacc12e5a68700"> Although self-interest motivated tech companies to create new power supplies, they have their sights set on residential consumers. Fortunately, Big Tech is already welcome in the home. Amazon evolved from delivering brown boxes of books to answering questions with Alexa and recording doorbell activity with Ring cameras. </p>
<p data-line-id="eef8f15fdaa24b07abc8e730c566cd5c"> Google recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-14/google-backed-company-merges-with-software-firm-to-help-electric-grid">merged</a> Nest Renew, its service to help users optimize their electricity usage, with the software business OhmConnect to align the energy consumption of households across the country. The new company, Renew Home, will pay people to lower their thermostats and turn off their lights during peak hours or even, when combined with artificial intelligence-enabled weather forecasting, before lightning storms strike. </p>
<p data-line-id="eb1f7b2db969495d9a39b5113a0b9182"> Executives at traditional electric utilities should respond to these free-wheeling, free-spending technical wizards by rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>The Godfather, Part II</em></a>, and heeding mob boss Michael Corleone’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfHJDLoGInM">advice</a>: “keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” At the same time, they should focus on communicating better with their customers. Has your utility ever sent you a newsletter, a movie link, or a dozen roses? Or does it come to mind only when you have a complaint, whether about the lights going off or a meter reader skulking in the backyard? </p>
<p data-line-id="b43dc7352e2b471584e17a6227c1fc9b"> Lastly, utilities should work with Big Tech to boost efficiency. A few weeks ago, Southern Company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-collaborate-samsung-smartthings-163000522.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC-umvmyeot9ZpbiehyKM5f_0CB0iJXppk__ogq4THscRpnTrCMz9FLiuRv8IIzQj-CKL0QmOwVaLEnQZer8Id9f7Te4nlUCHR8CvMbcQNqH3MUzvTYLG0GSZt7h4UqUDhKSYZsM7EIN7o9KgVirj_R55WkLxi8BxIAJrnz365NL">announced</a> a deal with Samsung SmartThings to create an innovation laboratory aimed at prodding communication among smart refrigerators, dishwashers, and garage-door openers in an effort to save power. In San Diego, the utility company Sempra is <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/17/sdge-toyota-join-forces-on-vehicle-to-grid-research-in-california/">partnering</a> with Fermata Energy so that electric vehicles can sell their battery power back to the grid when demand peaks. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0751893b90548cb873ae3d1b7ed57f6"> Ever since the age of Rockefeller and Thomas Edison, utilities were the Steady Eddies of investments, the clichéd favorite of dividend-seeking widows and other risk-averse investors. Whether or not the climate is getting warmer, the sector is getting hotter. And as Big Tech enters, sparks are beginning to fly. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4ea29a82d184483b8fb8839a2573f60"> NEW HAVEN – Multilateralism is waning, and one of the world’s leading multilateral institutions, the World Trade Organization, is in crisis, because the United States has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1LC19N/">blocking</a> new appointments to its dispute settlement mechanism’s Appellate Body since 2018. In the run-up to the WTO’s 13th Ministerial Conference last month, some optimists hoped to see progress on specific issues, such as an agreement not to impose tariffs on digital commerce, but expectations were generally low. </p><p data-line-id="ef332c1b230a44be9e2d35c40889c476"> The pessimists were right. India led the charge against extending a moratorium on e-commerce tariffs, and only a last-minute deal prolonged it for another two years. After that, it is expected to expire. India and its allies celebrated the outcome as a victory. For the first time in years, the culprit undermining the WTO was not the US but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-08/world-trade-organization-s-death-is-a-momentous-error?srnd=opinion">developing countries</a> (including Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, and others).  </p><p data-line-id="e8c46f84261d4061b1cf2d99550a495d"> True, what happened with digital commerce is characteristic of the usual conflicts that play out during trade negotiations. Free trade always produces winners and losers. Digital commerce may be in the interest of businesses in advanced economies as well as consumers and businesses in low- and middle-income countries; users of an app, game, or other software product made in a different country may pay lower prices in the absence of tariffs. But domestic producers will reliably demand protection from imports, and governments will see tariffs as a promising way to boost revenues. </p>

<p data-line-id="a6c28659f26442ccab94e03fa58c3097"> NEW YORK – Last year, US President Joe Biden’s administration infuriated lobbyists representing Big Tech firms and others that profit from our personal data by denouncing a proposal that would have gutted domestic data privacy, online civil rights and liberties, and competition safeguards. Now, Biden’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/28/executive-order-on-preventing-access-to-americans-bulk-sensitive-personal-data-and-united-states-government-related-data-by-countries-of-concern/">executive order</a> on Americans’ data security reveals that the lobbyists had good reason to worry. </p><p data-line-id="2f0329cb5f034820841b1ff12f1562e8"> After decades of data brokers and tech platforms exploiting Americans’ personal data without any oversight or restrictions, the Biden administration has announced that it will ban the transfer of certain kinds of data to China and other countries of concern. It is a small, but important, step toward protecting Americans’ sensitive personal information, in addition to government-related data. </p><p data-line-id="4895f7854b6844a785941b0c686f6f4d"> Moreover, the order is likely a precursor to additional policy responses. Americans are rightly worried about what is happening online, and their concerns extend well beyond privacy violations to a host of other digital harms, such as mis- and disinformation, social media-induced teenage anxiety, and racial incitement. </p>

<p data-line-id="dc977491c7ab4dcd81600531493e5753"> LJUBLJANA – The way <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/haiti-gangs-seize-control-us-canada-latin-america-do-nothing-by-jorge-heine-1-2024-03">things are going</a> in Haiti, violent gangs might not only gain an official government role; they might actually <em>become</em> the government. Following the gangs’ seizure of critical infrastructure and the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, Haiti is exhibiting all the familiar features of a failed state. Its people are left with a tragic choice: continued rule by a corrupt “democratic” elite, or direct rule by gangs who present themselves as “progressive.” </p><p data-line-id="86ae9f2697db4448aa71fcf7fe53781e"> With law and order having collapsed, CARICOM, the Caribbean regional intergovernmental organization, has <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/haiti-gang-violence-rescue-plans/">announced</a> an agreement to create a transitional council aimed at representing a wide swath of Haitian political and civil-society groupings. The council would wield some powers that typically belong to the (vacant) office of the president, including the power to name an interim prime minister. The resulting government would be expected eventually to hold elections, thus achieving a complete political reset. </p><p data-line-id="a17c7cbeb0904df9960b322cc5390857"> But whom will these new arrangements include? Haiti has been under a state of emergency since armed groups attacked the country’s largest prison earlier this month, killing and injuring police and prison staff, and allowing nearly 4,000 inmates to escape. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/03/world/haiti-gang-violence-cnnphotos/">gang leader</a> Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier – himself a former police officer – took credit for the attack and called for the government to be overthrown. Gangs now control 80% of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, having seized the country’s main airport to block Henry’s return from a diplomatic mission to Kenya, where he was hoping to secure police reinforcements. </p>

<p data-line-id="bfe89aa7f3174f31b41a70846eb66bf0"> COPENHAGEN – With the approach of June’s European Parliament elections, the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/executive-education/insights/articles/can-a-centre-right-coalition-emerge-after-the-next-eu-elections">grand coalition</a> of the European People’s Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), and Renew Europe faces a watershed moment. The EPP’s recent decision to nominate European Commission President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a> for a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-von-der-leyen-commission-0fd8783553685657b2d8364f5a2a9082">second term</a>, far from being merely procedural, could have profound implications for Europe as it confronts internal and external challenges of unprecedented magnitude. </p>
<p data-line-id="3256381a89e54d07b4791d6b958f60bc"> Together with its coalition partners, the EPP has steered the EU through multiple shocks over the past five years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened tensions with China, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent energy crisis. The EU’s achievements during this period have highlighted not only the bloc’s resilience of the European community but also the crucial role of unity and the need to preserve the current coalition. </p>
<p data-line-id="01739420b9f24e969aa66774e636e4f5"> Moreover, these challenges have underscored the importance of upholding the intergenerational contract and foundational values that underpin the EU. This is particularly important in the face of mounting pressures from extremists and populists who advocate simplistic, short-term fixes instead of tackling long-term, complex challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="8fde870dfd214544947fd5fbfe921c2c"> Looking ahead, the EU’s agenda will likely remain dominated by persistent crises, necessitating a unified and thoughtful approach. The EPP-led coalition could play a crucial role, fostering stability and economic development while navigating the challenges Europe must face. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="7f0ff87080ff4bbd91aa5906cdfe2711"> One of the main challenges will be the fight against climate change. Over the past few years, European leaders have worked together to protect the environment for future generations while striving to boost economic competitiveness.<strong> </strong>This collective effort has led to a significant reduction in transport-sector emissions and the adoption of the ambitious <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/green-deal/fit-for-55-the-eu-plan-for-a-green-transition/">Fit for 55</a> plan, a comprehensive legislative package aimed at reducing the EU’s net greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030. The plan includes binding targets for boosting renewable-energy production, reducing energy consumption, and lowering emissions in key industries. </p>
<p data-line-id="0e6543f36d3b4005927ca425f3b9e633"> Moreover, today’s geopolitical crises have brought security back to the top of Europe’s agenda, with EU member states aiming to <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/international-cooperation/global-targets-renewables-and-energy-efficiency_en">de-risk energy value chains</a> by focusing on renewables and efficiency measures. This strategic pivot reflects a broader commitment to sustainability that resonates beyond Europe’s borders, influencing energy policies around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="34c48795108d477d93ff23e7842b375c"> But this shift is not just about achieving climate goals. By focusing on renewable energies and de-risking supply chains, the EU also aims to shield European citizens and industries from the volatility of global energy markets, which are often influenced by geopolitical uncertainties. The bloc’s commitment to renewables is exemplified by Germany’s <a href="https://www.bmwk-energiewende.de/EWD/Redaktion/EN/Newsletter/2015/01/Meldung/topthema-the-energy-transition.html#:~:text=%22Energiewende%2C%22%20the%20energy%20transition,power%2C%20towards%20renewable%20energy%20sources."><em>Energiewende</em></a> (energy transformation) policy, as well as robust government investments in renewable energy in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden. These strategic investments have also bolstered the competitiveness of these countries’ energy industries. </p>
<p data-line-id="319436974a174058b4476406de4ecff2"> This is important because Europe is not alone in pursuing a sustainable future. Following the establishment of the EU’s <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en">Emissions Trading System</a>, countries like <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/equities/carbon-credit/index.html">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a7b017a-c54e-48e8-8c86-0654ed63979b">Brazil</a> have set up their own carbon markets. This global sustainability drive, while commendable, also means increased competition, again highlighting the need for unity as European countries seek to capitalize on the opportunities created by the green transition while striving to meet ambitious climate targets and tackle the complex challenges that come with implementation. </p>
<p data-line-id="1fc7b895e7e44a85a6f25eab4013f9c0"> While unity is the EU’s greatest asset in the fight against climate change, the EPP’s leadership, in particular, must continue to play a central role in advancing the EU’s climate agenda. This is no time to backtrack. The expansion of the EU carbon market into new sectors like maritime transport, and the bloc’s prominent role in international climate negotiations, are prime examples of its proactive approach. Faced with the existential threat of climate change, EPP, S&amp;D, and Renew leaders must draw on their experience, knowledge, and ambition to defend the bloc’s core values against rising populism and guide Europe through the challenging times ahead. </p>
<p data-line-id="c90cda5a9df34b33901ae24402394d16"> Far from a distant threat, climate change is already wreaking havoc across Europe. At this critical juncture, Europe requires unity, vision, and bold leadership more than ever. The future of the bloc, the welfare of its citizens, and the success of its industries are in our hands. For responsible political parties, now is no time to make Europe a victim of partisan paralysis. </p>

<p data-line-id="cee2d79562884f4096bab70e875b051b"> CHICAGO – It is becoming increasingly apparent that immigration will be a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">major issue</a> for voters in this year’s US presidential election. Since President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> took office in 2021, more than <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters">6.2 million</a> people who did not have permission to enter the United States have attempted to cross the border from Mexico, and more than <a href="https://cis.org/Arthur/Bidens-Released-Least-2020522-Southwest-Border-Migrants">two million</a> have been allowed to remain while they await an immigration hearing. </p><p data-line-id="315071d4df1c4f51898c1523f7b04a04"> This marked <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/02/11/trump-biden-immigration-border-compared/">increase</a> from previous years has become a major source of controversy. While Biden’s critics <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-claims-migrant-crime-wave-are-not-supported-national-data-rcna140896">claim</a> – <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/29/truth-about-illegal-immigration-crime/">dubiously</a> – that immigrants are driving up crime rates and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/03/06/trump-warns-gop-on-immigration-theyre-taking-your-jobs/">taking</a> Americans’ jobs, some Democrats are doubling down on calls to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/border-crossing-decriminalization.html">decriminalize</a> illegal border crossings altogether. The first group accuses the second of undermining <a href="https://lamborn.house.gov/issues/illegal-immigration">national security</a>, while advocates of decriminalization accuse immigration hardliners of <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democrats-border-bill-wrong/">racism</a> and xenophobia. With Americans arguably more divided than at any time <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/10/politics-stress-swing-states-elections/671729/">since the Civil War</a>, US politicians are peddling simplistic rhetoric about an immensely complex issue to stoke fear and anger, deepening the country’s political polarization. </p><p data-line-id="cf9f514940bc47a492a59d8c2ff7ee2b"> But there is good news for the American people: The truth about immigration is far less frightening than what some politicians and media figures want you to believe. For starters, immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than US citizens. Nationwide, illegal immigrants tend to be incarcerated at a much <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep24844?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">lower rate</a> than native-born Americans. In Texas, for example, illegal immigrants, in 2018, were <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-10/working-paper-60.pdf">45%</a> less likely to be convicted of a crime than native-born Americans. And the crime and incarceration rates for legal immigrants are even lower. </p>

<p data-line-id="7ff3fde717694fab9e274eda52bc4a7b"> PRINCETON – Among her final acts as chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel requested that her colleagues endorse the two people <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/08/rnc-trump-allies-leadership-2024">handpicked</a> by Donald Trump to replace her. Following loud cheering, she announced that she would not even bother to ask if there were any “nays.” It was a telling moment: procedures meant to ensure a democratic process within the party were entirely replaced by acclamation. </p><p data-line-id="5bd8ab32285e40c5a981cdeff22bdf28"> Trump is hardly the only far-right populist leader to have subjugated a political party to his will. The hijacking of a party’s machinery is a common pattern among populists and would-be autocrats, and history shows that it can have truly dire consequences for a democratic political system. After all, turning your party into an autocracy is a logical first step toward turning your country into one. </p><p data-line-id="674c3a4804f24f7ab6b1cb04bb474333"> True, appeals for democracy and pluralism within political parties can sound like idealism. Endless, exhausting, pedantic debates usually result in a “victory” for the most eloquent party hack – or perhaps for the person with no childcare responsibilities the next morning. Moreover, internal democracy – like primary elections in the United States – may be <a href="https://shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu/publications/books/responsible-parties">structurally favorable</a> to ideological purists who prefer extreme candidates, or it may elevate people who treat politics <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Politics-Is-for-Power/Eitan-Hersh/9781982116798">like a hobby</a> and prioritize the process over the results. </p>

<p data-line-id="2ffed1ab4a55437e8eea241073b703fd"> NEW YORK – The way people navigate traffic can tell us a lot about their respective cultures. Recently, while walking to my office in midtown Manhattan, I stopped at a red light when an elderly woman with a walking stick caught my attention as she cautiously looked both left and right. When she saw that no car was close enough to hit her – assuming they adhered to New York’s speed-limit laws – she gave me a puzzled look and crossed the street. I must admit, I felt a bit foolish. </p><p data-line-id="6f1e15b0884d4b5a95c4ba1a686b71ab"> Such an incident would be unthinkable in Japan. Years ago, on the first night of a weeklong visit to Tokyo, my young, jet-lagged children, who had lived only in India and the United States, were amazed by the law-abiding Japanese. Peering out of our apartment window at midnight, they observed a man standing alone at a crosswalk. Even with no cars in sight, he waited patiently for the light to turn green. </p><p data-line-id="9e2413eb2d20401b93ebc66dab6a0f3a"> While these normative differences may seem trivial, societal attitudes toward the law can significantly affect a country’s economic performance. Whereas the New Yorker’s actions could be interpreted as aligning with the spirit of the law, the Tokyo pedestrian adhered to its letter. </p>

<p data-line-id="9ddf449013754b87aec2edb8af981bc5"> EDINBURGH – Last Thursday, more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nigeria-mass-kidnapping-children-girls-kaduna-borno-states-isis-boko-haram/">280 Nigerian students</a> were kidnapped from their school in Kuriga, a town in the northern state of Kaduna – the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nigeria-mass-abduction-boko-haram-girls-kidnapped-reports-isis/">second mass abduction</a> of young Nigerians in the span of a week. The international community must urgently act to secure the release of these children, some of whom are as young as eight years old. But equally important is creating safer schools for students throughout Nigeria’s 36 states, so that all children can pursue an education without fear of abduction or violence. </p><p data-line-id="fe891b09fb674e778cbe397435242a1c"> The kidnapping in Kuriga was even larger than Boko Haram’s infamous raid on a girls’ secondary school in Chibok, a town in northeastern Borno State, in 2014. The Islamic militants kidnapped 276 girls; a decade later, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/04/nine-years-after-chibok-girls-abducted/">nearly 100</a> of them are still missing. Armed groups have targeted many schools in the intervening years, although not on the scale seen in the Kuriga attack, which took place only days after militants seized dozens of displaced people, reportedly including many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68490001">young women and girls</a>, in the Borno town of Gamboru Ngala. </p><p data-line-id="231f679307cf40288329880d63377831"> The international community can and must help. First and foremost, the Nigerian government needs surveillance support to locate the abducted pupils. As the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, I am in contact with governments and urging them to help determine the students’ whereabouts, with a view to their quick release. </p>

<p data-line-id="824fb8e1ac484dc3b05f434b9083959e"> ACCRA – It is well known that women in developing economies have fewer educational and employment opportunities than their male counterparts, leading to higher rates of poverty. In Ghana, for example, men have higher employment rates and incomes than women, and are <a href="https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/AHIES%202022%20Q1%20and%20Q2%20Labour%20Force%20Report.pdf">less likely</a> to be engaged in vulnerable jobs. Less widely recognized is that, by some metrics, the gap is not narrowing quickly enough: women in developing economies continue to account for a <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures">significant share</a> of the economically disadvantaged. Add disability to the mix, and the challenges facing women are even greater. </p><p data-line-id="f6e5883284ca42d3a786eb8adf3d0b07"> There are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">over one billion</a> people living with disabilities worldwide, some <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/challenges-facing-people-with-disabilities-in-sub-saharan-africa-in-5-charts#:~:text=About%20one%20billion%20people%20globally,of%20them%20in%20developing%20countries.">80%</a> of whom reside in developing countries. While there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK378951/">many models</a> for measuring disability, some conclusions are indisputable: disability is <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/10/Making-SDGs-count-for-women-with-disabilities.pdf">more prevalent</a> among women (19%) than men (12%); people with disabilities face high barriers to education and employment, leading to higher rates of lifelong poverty; and outcomes for women with disabilities are even worse than those for their male counterparts. </p><p data-line-id="d0959f6ceddc4de6a3735b1c3ce28583"> Ghana’s experience is a case in point. Women are disproportionately represented among the 8% of the population who face <a href="https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/2021%20PHC%20General%20Report%20Vol%203F_Difficulty%20in%20Performing%20Activities_final_161221.pdf">functional limitations</a> related to sight, hearing, mobility, cognition, self-care, and/or communication. And, as the chart shows, 68% of men with disabilities are in <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_631497.pdf">vulnerable employment</a>, compared to 80% of women with disabilities, while 40% of men with disabilities have attained secondary and post-secondary education, compared to just 31% of women with disabilities. </p>

<p data-line-id="937a901ed2ca46699e76c11ee3604b76"> STANFORD – Does free-market capitalism buttress democracy, or does it unleash anti-democratic forces? This question first emerged in the Age of Enlightenment, when capitalism was viewed optimistically and welcomed as a vehicle of liberation from the rigid feudal order. Many envisioned an equal-opportunity society of small producers and consumers, where no one would have undue market power, and where prices would be determined by the “invisible hand.” Under such conditions, democracy and capitalism are two sides of the same coin.  </p><p data-line-id="d1cf9f7545b74221921505f7034e2c67"><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/big-myth-9781635573572/">Domestic</a> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215462/dark-money-by-jane-mayer/">propaganda</a> in the United States has pushed the same optimistic vision over the past century, aiming to convince voters that free-market capitalism is essential to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way">American Way</a>,” and that their liberty depends on supporting unfettered free enterprise and distrusting government. But economic developments in recent decades suggest that we should re-examine such beliefs. </p><p data-line-id="bb72135b4a6e4cbdb9ec84cdaeefd13c"> To see why, allow me first to clarify some background <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/technology-innovation-how-monopolization-and-anticompetitive-market-power-work-by-mordecai-kurz-2023-12?utm_source=Project+Syndicate+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=89908e346e">ideas</a> about what I call <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-market-power-of-technology/9780231206532">technological competition</a> among innovating companies seeking to amass market power. Such competition differs from conventional price competition by producing only one or a few winners, rather than permitting all firms to survive with lower profits. </p>

<p data-line-id="b8e962ff6f5f403d8e193bea1e60cd63">In 2015, world leaders pledged to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” over the subsequent 15 years, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And yet, according to an estimate by the World Economic Forum, it will take another <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2023/">131 years</a> to reach gender parity.</p><p data-line-id="512c319bc4404940bada7fe52456c5c4">As European Investment Bank President <strong>Nadia Calviño</strong>, International Monetary Fund Managing Director <strong>Kristalina Georgieva</strong>, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development President <strong>Odile Renaud-Basso</strong> explain, pursuing gender equality is “not just about social justice or correcting current and past wrongs.” Rather, “inclusion is good for business,” with “greater gender balance on bank boards,” for example “associated with greater <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2017/wp17199.ashx" target="_blank">financial stability</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/15/Women-in-Fintech-As-Leaders-and-Users-520862" target="_blank">better performance</a>.” It is also good for the planet: “a one-percentage-point increase in female managers at a firm” leads to a “0.5% drop in carbon dioxide emissions.”</p><p data-line-id="6033ffe665c240eb98c487062cf353ef">But, as the World Bank’s <strong>Indermit Gill</strong> and <strong>Tea Trumbic</strong> show, recent progress toward gender equality has been significantly overestimated. For example, women now enjoy “just two-thirds of the legal rights that men do – not 77%, as was previously believed.” And even where legislation has been enacted, say, “mandating equal pay for women for work of equal value,” a lack of supportive policies and enforcement mechanisms limits its impact, resulting in a “colossal waste of human capital.”</p><p data-line-id="e9b6168e81b94d93bc27d74979c00b73">We know how to boost women’s economic prospects, points out <strong>Rudo Kayombo</strong> of BRAC International. In Africa, for example, “research and experience have shown the effectiveness of providing women and girls living in extreme poverty with a productive asset, support to meet their basic needs, and long-term coaching and training.” But while countries have “the resources, the evidence, and the technical knowledge,” they often lack “the political will to act.” </p><p data-line-id="620f1e57ee704590bd28aa9ef1804764">But there might be another key reason why economic policies are failing to empower women adequately: the underrepresentation of women in the economics profession. And as former Greek Finance Minister <strong>Yanis Varoufakis</strong> shows, “the field’s dearth of female <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/business/economy/economics-women-gender-bias.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank">role models</a>” is only part of the problem. The bigger issue is that the discipline is centered on <em>Homo economicus</em>: a “male chauvinist rational idiot” in whom “no sensible woman” recognizes herself.</p>

<p data-line-id="9b8000690918453fbba37bda028721d1"> BOGOTÁ/NAIROBI – Last month, the International Energy Agency’s ministerial gathering took place in Paris, while the African Union, which recently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/african-union-g20-world-leaders/#:~:text=The%20African%20Union%20(AU)%20has,prior%20to%20the%20AU%20joining.">joined the G20</a>, held its annual summit in Addis Ababa. Both fora recognized the urgent need to fulfill the commitments made at last December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, not least to <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">triple</a> installed renewable-energy capacity by 2030. But the challenges ahead are substantial. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f1cc458322c438c8d94ec5a53606471"> COP28 identified many actions that are crucial to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Beyond the sharp increase in renewable-energy capacity, these include <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_6053#:~:text=This%20initiative%2C%20first%20proposed%20by,of%204%25%2C%20by%202030.">doubling</a> the rate of energy-efficiency improvements by 2030, phasing down the “<a href="https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/cop28-ends-call-%E2%80%98transition-away%E2%80%99-fossil-fuels-un-chief-says-phaseout-inevitable">unabated</a>” use of fossil fuels, and providing financial support to developing countries as they work to expand energy access and advance economic development. </p>
<p data-line-id="8dcbb5033f33445483dad250e2167e63"> Africa and Latin America have a central role to play in fulfilling the world’s net-zero ambitions. Both regions boast abundant renewable-energy potential, thanks to vast solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources. By leveraging these, Africa and Latin America can make rapid progress in reducing their carbon emissions, enhancing energy access, and stimulating sustainable economic growth. </p>
<p data-line-id="9211638cf47049aa968c0776c0662f7d"> Our countries, Colombia and Kenya, are already making significant strides toward a cleaner energy mix. Though Colombia has massive oil and gas reserves, hydropower generation accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/lng/010424-colombia-imported-its-highest-annual-lng-volume-ever-in-2023">70%</a> of its electricity production. And the government is committed to increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix further by 2030. By harnessing wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal, Colombia can diversify its renewable-energy portfolio and further reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="d5e0bd405ba348c2845b57b13369e78a"> Colombia is also taking direct action to accelerate the phaseout of fossil fuels. The government recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/colombia-stop-new-oil-gas-exploration-davos">announced</a> a ban on the issuance of new licenses for oil and gas exploration, and has signaled its intention to address the negative effects of fossil-fuel extraction. These measures will not only curb carbon emissions, but also help protect the country’s vulnerable ecosystems and rich biodiversity. </p>
<p data-line-id="5169b166db9345b49b8e51d2b07095da"> As for Kenya, it is emerging as a renewable-energy success story in Africa. Using its vast geothermal, wind, solar, and hydroelectric resources, Kenya has raised the share of renewables in its electricity generation to a whopping <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/country-case-kenya-taps-the-earth-heat">94%</a>. Its geothermal sector has achieved remarkable growth, making it Africa’s leading producer of <a href="https://african.business/2023/11/energy-resources/africa-set-to-overtake-europe-on-geothermal-capacity-says-consultancy#:~:text=Kenya%20has%20led%20the%20way,world's%20seventh%2Dlargest%20geothermal%20producer.">geothermal power</a>. And now, Kenya is helping its neighbors, Ethiopia and Djibouti, to harness their own geothermal resources as well. </p>
<p data-line-id="0b4c2b2415624742bf70eecb9d3c866d"> Underpinning Kenya’s progress are government efforts to implement supportive policies and create an enabling environment for private investment. The Kenyan government’s forward-thinking approach has not only resulted in expanded energy access for its people; it has also created jobs and local industries, thereby advancing economic development and opening up opportunities to collaborate with others. Kenya is a <a href="https://www.irena.org/Events/2024/Jan/Accelerated-Partnership-for-Renewables-in-Africa-Country-Consultations-Zimbabwe#:~:text=Founded%20at%20the%20African%20Climate,to%20accelerate%20energy%20transitions%20in">founding member</a> of Accelerated Partnerships for Renewables in Africa, an initiative that aims to bolster the energy transition in African countries, with support from Denmark, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p data-line-id="5cc1fad5efbd4be895927dfe79b12b11"> Colombia and Kenya’s achievements should be highlighted and celebrated to motivate and guide other countries in their own clean-energy transitions. Those with fossil-fuel resources, for example, must follow Colombia’s example in limiting oil and gas exploration. </p>
<p data-line-id="e542841231c440cf823a2f340c6f088d"> But Colombia and Kenya are not only passive models for others to follow; they are also active global leaders. If their clean-energy transitions didn’t already make their commitments apparent, their recent decision to join the <a href="https://beyondoilandgasalliance.org/who-we-are/">Beyond Oil &amp; Gas Alliance</a> – an international coalition of governments and partners working to facilitate the fossil-fuel phaseout – should make them so. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a465706c95c4772b28353e4a0491216"> Still, financing is key if the world is to realize its clean-energy ambitions. Low investment in Africa is a major challenge. A recent BloombergNEF <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/scaling-up-renewable-energy-in-africa/">report</a> shows that in 2021, just 0.6% ($2.6 billion) of the $434 billion invested in renewable-energy projects went to African countries. A sharp increase in funding flows from rich countries to clean-energy sectors in both Africa and Latin America is urgently needed. </p>
<p data-line-id="6be9c224d46846cd94fe55e6db4d066f"> Beyond direct financial support from rich countries, the global financial system – including the International Monetary Fund and multilateral development banks – must urgently be reformed, so that it is fairer and more efficient. Only then can this system deliver enough financing to meet the growing needs of developing economies. Coordinated action to ease the debt burdens on developing economies is also vital. </p>
<p data-line-id="66098f294a404d6baeb66f2f21db2917"> At COP28, the Global South demonstrated solidarity and a commitment to cooperation. By sharing knowledge and best practices, developing economies can drastically accelerate the clean-energy transition. But, if the world is to succeed at combating climate change and safeguarding our collective future, bold action to ensure adequate financing is essential. </p>

<p data-line-id="50622587205845ecba190e70e4292018"> BERKELEY – In the United States, the long-term real safe interest rate – the inflation-adjusted return on low-risk investments such as Treasuries – is, in addition to “financial conditions,” the key mechanism influencing both the incentive to build and the balance of net exports (owing to its effect on the exchange rate). </p><p data-line-id="66b3aba458734401a78ea0243be16d3d"> From early March to mid-May 2022, this <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REAINTRATREARAT10Y">metric</a> jumped by more than one percentage point as the bond market realized that the US Federal Reserve would soon curtail its efforts to promote a speedy recovery in employment following the pandemic. Then, from late August to early October 2022, it jumped again, this time by an annualized 1.5 percentage points, as bond traders speculated that the Fed might have to tighten monetary policy to avert persistent inflation in an economy that had returned to full employment. </p><p data-line-id="f92d42a6c4354fc897e95702cbf6cc4b"> It was these two spikes that created the current interest-rate configuration.

<p data-line-id="2427d0b3343f4eb9bee1f6b260ff0f12"> BUENOS AIRES – Health is much more than a personal matter; it is essential to a society’s well-being and productivity. But achieving equitable health outcomes for all remains a challenge. This is especially true in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a region beset by <a href="https://lacir.lse.ac.uk/en-gb/about">extreme</a> and <a href="https://scioteca.caf.com/handle/123456789/2072">persistent</a> inequalities. </p><p data-line-id="1b4ec9c3a72940fb8df06fd99bac42fc"> To be sure, when it comes to its biggest health concerns, LAC is far from an outlier. Whereas three decades ago the region dealt primarily with maternal, neonatal, and communicable diseases, it is now <a href="https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/51802">confronting</a> – like much of the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136832">rest of the world</a> – a rising tide of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular conditions, cancers, diabetes, and mental-health disorders. But this shift presents unique challenges in a region where the disease burden is disproportionately <a href="https://lacir.lse.ac.uk/en-gb/publications/health-inequalities-in-latin-american-and-the-caribbean-child-adolescent-reproductive-metabolic-syndrome-and-mental-health">borne by the most disadvantaged</a>. </p><p data-line-id="ed534ac6a4e245eba38b7920cf6a222f"> The region’s large health disparities are particularly pronounced in childhood. Infant mortality, for example, is nearly <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/tasas-de-mortalidad-en-menores-de-5-anos-2000-y-2017-o-el-ano-mas-cercano_bd991c37-es">four times higher</a> in LAC than in OECD countries. Our study found that, in Bolivia, Guatemala, Haiti, and Peru, mortality is roughly <a href="https://lacir.lse.ac.uk/en-gb/publications/health-inequalities-in-latin-american-and-the-caribbean-child-adolescent-reproductive-metabolic-syndrome-and-mental-health">three times higher</a> for infants whose parents completed at most a primary education compared to those whose parents completed secondary school. Moreover, in Colombia and Paraguay, infant mortality is more than five times higher for households in the lowest wealth quintile compared to those in the highest. </p>

<p data-line-id="0d1b8e8929dc4d23a9383cc30412740e"> NEW YORK – While we are all paying a steep price for climate change already, today’s children and young people will have to endure far worse conditions, and for far longer. In fact, climate change will only continue to intensify for the rest of their lives if we remain on our current path. That is why a group of young Americans filed a lawsuit against the United States in 2015, demanding that climate change be responsibly considered in government decisions. </p><p data-line-id="274ff5b83c1544b5826b146bdeb8e412"> I will be gone well before the full effects of climate change are felt, but each of the 21 young people who filed the suit, <em>Juliana v. US</em>, will see their lives altered in fundamental ways. When it is their future at stake, asking American children to wait until they are old enough to vote for change is not a viable option. </p><p data-line-id="b28c7e4d4e8d4b8bb8324eb9f52d0ae4"> The judicial system (when it works) is an important mechanism through which the public can hold elected leaders accountable. And for children, at this late hour, it is their <em>only </em>remedy. Climate change, now a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9359205/">major cause</a> of youth anxiety and depression, is already affecting their physical and mental health. </p><p data-line-id="8a997be8774f4e25b9dc70c815b71de4"> The “<em>Juliana</em> 21” are making the case for all Americans. We all have a right to a livable climate, with clean air and water. But rather than proceeding with the lawsuit, the federal government seems adamantly opposed to the young plaintiffs having their day in court. In the nine years since <em>Juliana </em>was filed, the <em>Juliana</em> 21 and their legal team have fought 14 attempts by the US government to stop it in its tracks. (Full disclosure: I have been a <em>pro bono </em>expert witness in this case.) </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="465b063b4bba45258504aa15571fcaa7"> Just last month, for the seventh time in the <em>Juliana</em> lawsuit, the federal government filed for a writ of mandamus, an extreme legal tactic in which a higher court orders a lower court not to hear a case (rather than following the usual process, where the higher court rules on a case only after it has been heard by lower courts). The new move subverts the judicial process and keeps the <em>Juliana</em> 21 from having their evidence heard and considered in open court. </p><p data-line-id="83cafd43d0e64dc7a3d98e896f309b70"> The government’s actions are puzzling, considering that courts around the world and in the US have been allowing young plaintiffs to bring similar suits. For example, in another case brought by the non-profit Our Children’s Trust (which also filed the <em>Juliana</em> case), a Montana court recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/us/montana-youth-climate-ruling.html">determined</a> that every additional ton of greenhouse-gas emissions would exacerbate the already grave constitutional injuries to the young plaintiffs. The judge therefore ruled that government officials must consider these harms carefully when reviewing applications for fossil-fuel permits. With Montana’s Supreme Court having rejected an effort by the state to pause implementation of this landmark ruling, state agencies are now already working to apply the new standard. </p><p data-line-id="8e8c4fd7dde74971addaf8b145ec5b2f"><em>Juliana</em>, in its own way, has also made legal history: No other case in the US has had seven petitions for writ of mandamus against it. As the plaintiffs <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.123110/gov.uscourts.ord.123110.574.0.pdf">note</a>, “of the more than 40,000 civil cases in which the US is a defendant represented by the Department of Justice,” only in <em>Juliana</em> “has the Solicitor General sought to stop the development of an evidentiary record at trial…purely on the basis that it costs the government too much money to proceed.” </p><p data-line-id="6b1635a321814f7a8656f9ee7453e5ca"> As the Montana court recognized, the climate crisis grows more grave by the day. Every day, more carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere; and every day, the US government <a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs">spends</a> tens of millions of dollars subsidizing the fossil-fuel industry. This costs us doubly, because we are paying both for the subsidy itself and for the environmental and health damages caused by drilling and powering our energy sectors with highly polluting fuels instead of clean and available renewable energy. </p><p data-line-id="37d5d87c3b2540a185c13065a2460b10"> If the price of litigating the case is too high for the government, that is partly because the government has waged a nine-year battle to stifle the <em>Juliana</em> 21’s voices. Indeed, another delay would merely add to the overall expected litigation costs. Moreover, my own assessment of the environmental costs incurred over these past nine years of delays shows that they are overwhelmingly higher than the financial costs cited by the government. </p><p data-line-id="adf14112aaba47e9a90b57dd100b665f"> This is not a matter of the administration saying, “We don’t interfere with the Department of Justice.” In this case, the <em>administration</em> is the defendant, and it has full responsibility for the actions of its solicitor general. </p><p data-line-id="449ff8eb5a1043ad8ae9f675142e1fde"> The best outcome – morally, economically, and environmentally – would be to settle with the children. All they want is for the government to consider the effects of climate change on them and later generations when making policy decisions. That seems like a no-brainer. </p><p data-line-id="4f640d31c27b4425b41473ddaa7942cb"> If, for some peculiar reason, the administration does not want to settle, then it should at least allow the matter to go to trial. The US Constitution and judicial system are powerful vehicles for shaping what our democracy delivers for young people who have no vote on a life-threatening, long-term issue such as the climate crisis. </p><p data-line-id="bcba32fd223f44348b3e3491b77df256"> The <em>Juliana </em>21 understand that if the Solicitor General succeeds again in delaying their trial, they will remain powerless to curtail their government from making the problem worse. Just as there is urgency in addressing the climate crisis, there is urgency – right now – in stopping the Solicitor General from resorting to the extraordinary tactic of asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to dismiss the case, effectively denying the young plaintiffs their right to a trial. </p><p data-line-id="6ef3677eee27493fbb20e19a0c454246"> We must stand behind the <em>Juliana </em>21. In this case, justice delayed truly is justice denied. </p>

Yet hovering over the occasion are questions about the future of Indian democracy itself. </p><p data-line-id="2460465d55064a52917ba49d0cfaada2"> After a decade of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holding power, the country’s democratic culture and institutions have been substantially eroded. BJP rule has featured frequent threats to dissent and a cultural shift away from pluralism. Civil liberties and press freedoms have visibly come under strain, with the party repressing and intimidating political opponents, student protestors, media organizations, individual journalists, and human-rights organizations. </p><p data-line-id="dd3cc647a19b4d1ab2c7a77069d4c7bd"> Among other things, the authorities have targeted and arrested journalists and activists on <a href="https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/resource/threats-to-democracy-in-india/">charges of sedition</a>, simply because they covered farmers’ protests or exposed abuses of power. They have pressured <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/elon-musks-x-claims-modi-government-issued-executive-orders-to-withhold-specific-accounts-and-posts-2905165">social-media platforms</a> and mainstream newspapers to remove critical content.

<p data-line-id="d6745e9d9f3349fbad54c8dd3d37b4d6"> STANFORD – As the world splits into rival geopolitical and military blocs, economic ties are fraying, and political, military, and business leaders worldwide are growing increasingly anxious about America’s presidential election this fall. As is usually the case, the outcome will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-05/what-economic-models-say-about-the-2024-presidential-election?embedded-checkout=true">be heavily influenced</a> by voters’ perception of economic conditions and the incumbent’s economic policies. </p><p data-line-id="ce13bf6859b14cbca3aa91d12e819df3"> In 1980, a recession and high inflation gave rise to the “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-30/americans-like-sharing-bad-economic-news-way-too-much">misery index</a>” (reflecting the inflation rate plus the unemployment rate) and allowed Ronald Reagan to crush the incumbent president, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/jimmy-carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. But US Federal Reserve Chair <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-volcker">Paul Volcker’s</a> aggressive policies to rein in inflation then caused a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/12/14/reagans-recession/">deep recession</a>, dooming Republicans to large losses in the 1982 midterm elections. By 1984, however, the annual growth rate had <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/996758/rea-gdp-growth-united-states-1930-2019/">reached 7%</a>, and Reagan was handily re-elected. </p><p data-line-id="3fc3fcb5cd16443b8683155053e850a1"> In the looming contest between former President Donald Trump and President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> (both of whom have very high <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/biden-may-be-losing-his-favorability-advantage-over-trump-new-polls-suggest.html">disapproval ratings</a>), the economy, once again, is voters’ leading <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-trump-hedge-biden-potential-2024-rematch">concern</a>, followed by illegal immigration and abortion. On abortion policy, the Supreme Court’s decision overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em> kicked the issue back to the states, some of which have enacted stringent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">prohibitions</a>. Democrats thus believe that the issue will weigh in their favor, particularly among suburban women. </p>

<p data-line-id="8b357dc5dce34efbb695a3237b13317c"> BERKELEY – Frontier markets are back. Several African countries have recently returned to global financial markets, placing foreign-currency bonds with international investors. The question is whether they are back for good, or whether someone or something – namely, the US Federal Reserve – will throw a wrench in the works. </p><p data-line-id="2d77f2623cb148b4b462613c27dcfb4d"> Let’s start with the facts. In January and early February, <a href="https://www.cnbcafrica.com/2024/ivory-coast-says-it-raised-2-6-bln-in-oversubscribed-eurobonds-issuance/">Côte d’Ivoire</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-06/benin-s-debut-dollar-bonds-oversubscribed-by-more-than-six-times">Benin</a> were able to place $3.35 billion of bonds with international investors. Côte d’Ivoire’s issue was more than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eurobond-oversubscription-eases-pressure-c%C3%B4te-divoire-6agye#:~:text=C%C3%B4te%20d'Ivoire's%20three%20times,hope%20for%20under%2Dpressure%20African">three times</a> oversubscribed, and Benin’s more than <a href="https://dabafinance.com/en/news/benin-republics-first-ever-eurobond-oversubscribed-over-six-times#:~:text=Benin's%20inaugural%20dollar%20bond%20offering,to%20finance%20Benin's%202024%20budget.">six times</a>. Kenya followed with a $1.5 billion Eurobond that attracted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/kenya-s-eurobond-attracts-more-than-5-billion-in-orders">more than $5 billion</a> in orders. This activity marked the end of a two-year dry spell when African borrowers were locked out of international capital markets. </p><p data-line-id="eb3d1147e1cb449dbe7c2104e1f65a2d"> In several cases, the revenue raised will be used to buy back debt maturing this year or next. The fact that investors are willing to participate suggests that they are confident in governments’ ability to service their debts. They are not seeking to exit once their holdings mature. </p>

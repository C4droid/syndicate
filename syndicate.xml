<p data-line-id="e20129d95b2d4ebb9dfc88bb53139f6f"> CAMBRIDGE – Last June, during French President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a>’s Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, Kenyan President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/william-ruto">William Ruto</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df7f68b1-8362-4895-9d24-c8483a9c2ee5">warned</a> that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are “hostage” to the world’s wealthiest countries and unable to meet the development challenges facing the Global South<a>.</a> Echoing United Nations Secretary-General <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a>’s <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sgsm21486.doc.htm">call to reform</a> the “morally bankrupt global financial system” that “perpetuates poverty and inequalities,” Ruto <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankvangansbeke/2023/07/14/kenya-president-rutos-call-for-a-new-green-global-bank/?sh=7ba11e57e503">proposed</a> creating a new multilateral institution that is fit for purpose and treats all member countries as equals. </p><p data-line-id="3bee831192e84960ba0da71a8d2d35da"> More than any other region, Africa has borne the brunt of the dysfunction embedded in the world’s financial architecture. Despite decades of engagement with the Bretton Woods system, the continent suffers stubbornly high unemployment and poverty rates, even as living standards have improved elsewhere in the developing world. </p><p data-line-id="88634429340749018eb81c8d01d555cd"> The latest reform push for the Bretton Woods institutions creates an opportunity to build a more inclusive global financial system that matches Africa’s aspirations, accelerates the transition to a net-zero world, and advances development objectives more broadly. Such a transformation has become essential as the world economy contends with the mounting effects of climate change, and as major geopolitical shifts threaten to accelerate global fragmentation. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly On Point newsletter" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-onpoint-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><h2 data-line-id="f8f5fb4cbdfb4d819ff154e2893838d1"><strong>On the Losing End</strong></h2><p data-line-id="fde3b39d607a4ee0b33dce56208ca0b4"> Africa has long been in a vulnerable position within the multilateral system, owing to a constellation of destabilizing forces and policies. The asymmetry of subsidies, which powerful countries with greater fiscal space are more able to deploy, has been a significant constraint on the ability of African countries to diversify sources of growth and competitiveness. The developed world’s recent embrace of industrial policy in response to the escalating climate crisis and volatility of global supply chains is a clear example of this. </p><p data-line-id="51390fe64a984cd29ce691ce324d64f6"> Moreover, financial repression, in conjunction with a chronic technological deficit, has further curtailed African countries’ economic development and limited their participation in global value chains to providing raw materials. Given the growing role in global trade of intermediate and manufactured goods with higher technological content, the stickiness of the colonial development model of resource extraction has been very costly for Africa, inexorably shrinking its share of global trade and exacerbating its exposure to global volatility and recurring balance-of-payment crises. </p><p data-line-id="a9ad4338be25432a92ad50428ee32983"> Multilateralism has thus failed to narrow the prosperity gap between Africa and the rest of the world. Africa’s <a href="https://press.lse.ac.uk/site/books/e/10.31389/lsepress.hat/">share of world trade</a> has declined steadily over the last few decades, falling from around 5% in the 1970s to less than 3% in 2022. And even though the continent accounts for around 17% of the global population, it is home to <a href="https://www.ispionline.it/en/publication/is-poverty-growing-again-in-sub-saharan-africa-trends-and-measures-137866">more than 60%</a> of the world’s extreme poor – which could rise to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-09/africa-may-have-90-of-the-world-s-poor-by-2030-world-bank-says">90%</a> by 2030, according to the World Bank. By contrast, countries in Asia have capitalized on labor-intensive, export-led development models to narrow the income gap with advanced economies and lift <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/asia-global-poverty-reduction-report/">hundreds of millions of people</a> out of poverty. </p>
<p data-line-id="e5b4eb0a22da4b5e9416ac7c4ed4f8c0"> As a result of financial repression, the process of structural transformation has continued to elude Africa, and the region is not well integrated into the current two-tiered global financial system, which privileges wealthy countries in the deployment of capital and the issuance of reserve currencies. This is at the root of the “perception premiums,” the overinflated risks perennially assigned to Africa, and the default-driven interest rates that have put many African countries into a debt trap.  </p><p data-line-id="85083874f9e34ac3846904cb776a50a3"> In particular, these rates raise the fiscal cost of servicing sovereign debt – more than 50% of government revenues in the most vulnerable countries, such as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ghana-economy-debt-idAFL1N32V0IE/">Ghana</a>. And yet, the external debt stock of African countries accounts for <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Seminars/Conferences/2023/09/13/back-to-the-trend-global-debt-evolution">less than 1%</a> of global sovereign debt. </p><p data-line-id="d0b9959b1b6748279b4ddb358236555f"> Risk perceptions of Africa have been elevated for decades, with credit-rating agencies assigning sub-investment-grade scores to an overwhelming majority of African countries. With capital scarce, the continent has been unable to invest in other major drivers of economic growth, most notably human resources and physical and digital infrastructure. For example, so acute is the continent’s energy crisis that most African businesses spend a sizable portion of their revenues operating <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/oxfam-us/www/static/media/files/oxfam-RAEL-energySSA-pt1.pdf">diesel generators</a>, which, aside from exacerbating external imbalances and the climate crisis, inhibits investment and undermines growth. </p><p data-line-id="9edf5ba67534443e9a2c67b351910463"> Africa’s chronically insufficient infrastructure has also widened the global digital divide, which poses a further impediment to development, because technology has overtaken organizational change as the primary driver of economic growth. In the US, for example, the tech sector contributed nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1239480/united-states-leading-states-by-tech-contribution-to-gross-product/">$2 trillion</a> to GDP in 2022, accounting for 9.3% of total output. By contrast, nearly <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2023/06/26/from-connectivity-to-services-digital-transformation-in-africa">70%</a> of Africa’s population does not have broadband internet access, and persistent policy constraints, most notably shrinking fiscal space, make it almost impossible to build more robust infrastructure. As a result, African countries have been unable to reap <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/World_Development_Report_2016/MquKCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover">digital dividends</a> in the form of higher productivity, faster growth, and expanded employment opportunities. </p><p data-line-id="da69e653bf844d0384f02f65022ba665"> In much of the world, the private sector is expected to play a central role in driving innovation-led growth. But Africa faces a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-needs-more-entrepreneurship-supportive-governments-by-hippolyte-fofack-2023-11">shortage of entrepreneurs</a>, owing largely to the difficulty of <a href="https://www.su.org/blog/challenges-for-africas-entrepreneurial-leaders-in-the-digital-era">accessing finance</a>. And, faced with massive debt-service costs – projected to have risen 35% in 2023, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/opinion/climate-change-africa-debt.html">$62 billion</a>, owing to rapid tightening of global financial conditions – African governments lack the capacity to expand productivity-enhancing public investment, crowd in private capital, and attract foreign direct investment. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, <a href="https://unctad.org/news/foreign-direct-investment-developing-economies-fell-9-2023">FDI flows</a> to Africa were a paltry $48 billion in 2023, whereas Asia received $584 billion. </p><p data-line-id="4ef52ca92b9a45fca91211f9bf135fa6"> At the same time, a series of procyclical downgrades by credit-rating agencies pushed more African countries into junk status and further curtailed their access to global finance. In 2022, only three African countries (Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa) were able to tap capital markets, raising a total of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/silver-lining-for-african-countries-of-silicon-valley-banks-demise/">$6 billion</a>, down from $19.6 billion in 2021, at default-driven borrowing rates. This led <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/zainab-shamsuna-ahmed">Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed</a>, Nigeria’s then-finance minister, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-has-no-plans-issue-eurobonds-2023-finance-minister-2022-12-14/">announce</a> in December 2022 that her country would not issue Eurobonds in 2023 unless market conditions improved. </p><h2 data-line-id="19f968e9c4454b6a89fae82bf848023f"><strong>Industrialization, Interrupted</strong></h2><p data-line-id="4da6800129f24d7d9f3e4a4efd0cd11c"> The Bretton Woods institutions further limited Africa’s development options by implementing structural adjustment policies during the post-1990s era of hyper-globalization. The Washington Consensus – the pro-market policy cocktail of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization espoused by the IMF and the World Bank – gave rise to costly austerity measures, with public investment being among the first casualties. </p><p data-line-id="ffac75c672174507a0529df1f90f343d"> For starters, these structural adjustment policies contributed to the dismantling of Africa’s nascent manufacturing base, which consisted mainly of state-led enterprises that had been established after achieving independence. This put the continent on the path toward premature deindustrialization, with African countries <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w20935">running out of industrialization opportunities</a> sooner and at much lower levels of income compared to early industrializers. </p>

<p data-line-id="df178f6c5531494996d58fd426458fab"> The Washington Consensus also undermined investment in human capital. For example, African countries continue to suffer from a serious shortage of skilled engineers and scientists, with a ratio of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-022-00474-5">198 scientists per million inhabitants</a>, compared to the world average of 1,150 per million. The chronic lack of technical capacity has hindered African governments’ ability to develop the infrastructure needed to attract private capital and expand Africa’s industrial base, and, crucially, to capitalize fully on the continent’s abundant natural resources to develop robust regional value chains and unlock endogenous growth potential. </p><p data-line-id="08f48c6b837e417a8cd53799a23627f5"> Consider that Africa is home to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings">60% of the best solar resources</a> globally, but only 1% of installed solar generating capacity. Without the human capital and financial resources to harness its energy resources (renewable or non-renewable), Africa has become the world’s most energy-poor continent. Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) uses <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-africa-can-show-the-world-the-way-to-a-low-carbon-future-10-facts-10-actions/">less electricity than Spain</a>, and <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings">600 million people</a> on the continent – nearly 43% of the total population – lack access to power. </p><p data-line-id="055911f72cce43f69bed8a8d60a97d66"> Given that industrialization is energy-intensive, Africa’s energy poverty has left the continent increasingly dependent on <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-needs-more-entrepreneurship-supportive-governments-by-hippolyte-fofack-2023-11">imported manufactured goods</a>. Over the long term, this has undermined the growth of intracontinental trade, which remains dismally low, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Digital-Journeys-Africa-freeing-foreign-exchange-wellisz">accounting for</a> around 15% of total African trade, compared to 60% in Asia and 70% in the European Union. Thus, the imported cars clogging city streets in many African countries represent a massive hole in the balance of payments – even though the continent possesses all the raw materials to <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Regional_Value_Chain_Integration_Automotive_Case_Study_2021.pdf">manufacture automobiles domestically</a>. </p><p data-line-id="7c436130f59a4b5bb62b703e0e80daaf"> The enduring colonial development model of resource extraction has only perpetuated the unhealthy correlation between growth and commodity-price cycles, resulting in increased exposure to adverse global shocks and the amplified perception premiums that are behind Africa’s default-driven borrowing rates. This, in turn, constrains refinancing options, turning liquidity challenges into solvency problems and raising the risk of sovereign-debt crises.  </p><p data-line-id="60f83e76e60740b695d7fe33f2a8300b"> So far, the only four countries that have applied to the G20’s Common Framework for Debt Treatment are African, even though the continent has the lowest share of global public debt. Spreads on Eurobonds issued by these countries (Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia) were in the double digits, putting them on the path toward failure from the outset and making the perceived high risk of default a self-fulfilling prophecy. </p><p data-line-id="55f8e178ec6d4af792fef2decf3908ea"> In addition to fueling the risk of debt default and undermining the expansion of growth-enhancing public investment, the vicious cycle of recurrent balance-of-payments crises is also keenly felt at the household level. The unemployment rate is at Great Depression-levels – above 30% in <a href="https://norvanreports.com/nigerias-unemployment-rate-to-hit-37-in-2023/">Nigeria</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-unemployment-rate-down-slightly-326-q2-2023-08-15/">South Africa</a>, two of the continent’s largest economies. This fuels migration pressures, as more and more young Africans seek opportunities elsewhere, and exacerbates intergenerational poverty. </p><h2 data-line-id="8b767e6ff6b1480593418843055ec9a9"><strong>Bretton Woods to Blame?</strong></h2><p data-line-id="6bc4e22ae5cf46eebad55aae3d763afb"> While no single entity is solely responsible for Africa’s dire situation, it is fair to say that the continent’s sustained engagement with the Bretton Woods institutions has narrowed African countries’ economic policymaking capacity to the management of balance-of-payments crises. Africa’s international partners have done nothing to promote industrialization on the continent. Worse, many wealthy countries have made use of subsidies to bolster their domestic industries and competitiveness, adding to the burden on African entrepreneurs and business leaders, who are already contending with the high costs of financial repression and a chronic infrastructure deficit. This misalignment of development priorities became even more important after the World Bank, at the height of the Washington Consensus, shifted to offering balance-of-payments support. </p><p data-line-id="62ade5a12ea54770aeea8325b1dbb513"> As a result, Africa has been confronting crises with increasing frequency. In addition to security, energy, debt, and migration crises, the continent is currently experiencing the devastating effects of climate change: water stress, food insecurity, extreme weather events, and violent conflict, all of which ultimately lead to lower economic growth. And yet, Africa’s share of global climate financing is currently just <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/09/POV-climate-financing-that-puts-people-first-rania-al-mashat">5.5%</a>. </p><p data-line-id="8336377e59a74223a6db5d31233e02ad"> It was not supposed to be this way. The continent’s outlook following the wave of decolonization of the 1960s was bright. In his 1968 book <em>Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations</em>, Nobel laureate economist Gunnar Myrdal <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Asian-Drama-An-Inquiry-into-the-Poverty-of-Nations">predicted</a> that Africa would enjoy better growth prospects than Asia. </p><p data-line-id="cb9a8c6fb6a8444ebf5c9a52028fabd7"> The opposite happened. Asia, unlike Africa, benefited from access to affordable and patient capital, which helped it close its yawning gaps in human and physical capital and led to economic diversification and successful demographic transitions. This has yielded significant dividends in knowledge production, for example, with Asia accounting for 66.8% of the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_941_2019-chapter1.pdf">world’s patent applications</a> in 2018 (only 0.5% came from Africa). Bolstered by sustained investment catalyzing export diversification and effective integration into the global economy, Asia entered a long and virtuous cycle of robust economic growth, whereas <a href="https://unctad.org/publication/state-commodity-dependence-2023">more than four-fifths</a> of African countries remain dependent on commodity exports and therefore highly vulnerable to global volatility and terms-of-trade deterioration. </p><p data-line-id="c290af12f01f453c802ce0ffc9a2288a"> In their rush to promote free markets and trade liberalization, the Bretton Woods institutions failed to consider African countries’ individual circumstances and their positions on the economic-development ladder when prescribing austerity measures. Speaking at a news conference after the opening of the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa in February 2023, Guterres remarked that realizing Africa’s potential requires overcoming a series of challenges. Chief among them, he <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/un-secretary-general-guterres-advocates-more-debt-relief-for-africa/6969355.html">stressed</a>, is the “dysfunctional and unfair global financial system that denies many African countries the debt relief and concessional financing they need.” </p><p data-line-id="705b93394a4d43d398e62eb5fdd1d64c"> But to the extent that Africa faces the perpetual threat of debt overhang, owing to the twin problems of financial repression and a chronic technological deficit, reforming this “dysfunctional and unfair” system requires channeling affordable and patient capital toward the continent. Similar to the postwar Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe, this financing would accelerate the structural transformation of African countries and the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Such an approach could reduce the unhealthy correlation between growth and commodity-price cycles and, eventually, mitigate correlation risks (one of the main drivers of perception premiums), which would help to leverage more private capital. </p><p data-line-id="485218d4703b460fb3952e6538fdcba4"> In other parts of the world, trade integration has spurred structural transformation and the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/REO/SSA/Issues/2019/04/01/sreo0419">development of new products</a>, suggesting that, under the right conditions, the AfCFTA would accelerate the diversification of the sources of growth required to boost both extra- and intra-African trade and sustain robust economic growth. Preliminary estimates show that intra-African exports would <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/trade/publication/free-trade-deal-boosts-africa-economic-development">increase by 109%</a>, led by manufactured goods, especially if the implementation of the AfCFTA is accompanied by robust trade facilitation measures. This is important in a region where the consequences of non-tariff barriers, equivalent to an <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/09/Straight-Talk-the-drive-for-trade-integration-azour-aemro-selassie">import tariff of 18%</a>, have been just as costly for trade and endogenous growth as market fragmentation has been. Corporations could take advantage of economies of scale and the gains in productivity and competitiveness associated with <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0055/004/article-A015-en.xml">investing in smaller markets</a>. </p><p data-line-id="d888c54cad5746c8ad60766da2e88d47"> The rules of origin underpinning the AfCFTA would stimulate industrialization, as championed by African leaders, in a region where industrialization and intra-African trade are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-future-of-african-trade-in-the-afcfta-era/#:~:text=World%20Bank%20estimates%20show%20that,between%20111%25%20and%20159%25.&amp;text=The%20AfCFTA%20has%20brightened%20African%20trade%20and%20growth%20prospects.">mutually reinforcing</a>.

How can we create a new system that has Africa’s best interests at heart and realizes the tremendous growth and development potential that Myrdal recognized nearly six decades ago? </p><p data-line-id="f0faf3e27a4d46f2b630e2ff1e6ad398"> Some important proposals have already been advanced. In its “<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2023/01/13/world-bank-group-statement-on-evolution-roadmap">evolution roadmap</a>” released last year, the World Bank outlined a wide range of options to revamp its business model and boost its lending capacity to help its member countries deal with climate change and other global challenges. These include an injection of new capital, changes in the Bank’s capital structure, a higher statutory lending limit, lower equity-to-loan requirements, and deployment of callable capital. They also include innovative financial instruments such as guarantees for private-sector loans, and a new concessional lending trust fund to attract financing from bilateral shareholders and private foundations in support of growth and the green transition in middle-income countries. But for low-income African countries, which have remained highly vulnerable to global volatility and recurrent adverse commodity terms-of-trade shocks, the scale of development challenges calls for a massive injection of patient and affordable capital. </p><p data-line-id="7ffa4f8741ea496a90b676cb61721853"> In the short term, Guterres has called on the IMF to redirect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/opinion/climate-change-africa-debt.html">$100 billion</a> a year in special drawing rights (SDRs, the Fund’s reserve asset), to pay for investments in sustainable development and climate action. Meanwhile, the Bridgetown Initiative, championed by Barbadian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/mia-amor-mottley">Mia Amor Mottley</a>, has <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/04/press-release-with-clock-ticking-for-the-sdgs-un-chief-and-barbados-prime-minister-call-for-urgent-action-to-transform-broken-global-financial-system/">proposed measures</a> to channel more credit and investment into strengthening climate resilience. That includes providing debt relief and restructuring to climate-vulnerable countries, increasing official-development assistance to $500 billion annually, and making international financial institutions more representative, equitable, and inclusive. </p><p data-line-id="82aac1af14b34081afe8b9c2489aa20f"> But any meaningful reform should address the entrenched inequalities that are largely responsible for recurrent debt crises in low-income countries. Policymakers must devise a new and improved credit-rating system to account for countries’ growth prospects and long-term debt sustainability, while remaining consistent with the IMF’s assessment of macroeconomic stability. This would ensure that any improvements in macroeconomic fundamentals are credit positive and would provide equal access to reliable and affordable capital. At the same time, this system should be underpinned by an inter-temporal approach to fiscal deficits that enables countries to mobilize funds for structural transformation – measures that increase deficits in the short and medium term may be necessary to put countries on the road toward long-term fiscal and debt sustainability. </p><p data-line-id="39cba21078904edebe2c3902d0f8d34b"> It will also be necessary to support the development of Africa’s digital infrastructure, as this would accelerate the transition to a multipolar monetary system and the use of local-currency settlement (LCS) arrangements. In addition to cutting transaction costs and boosting efficiency, the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/making-global-monetary-system-work-for-global-south-by-hippolyte-fofack-2023-02">use of LCS</a> for cross-border trade would boost intra-African trade, help ease the balance-of-payments constraints associated with dollar funding, and deepen regional integration. </p><p data-line-id="1d02d6de881a477db18472fc6a064622"> Considering that <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Digital-Journeys-Africa-freeing-foreign-exchange-wellisz">more than 85%</a> of intraregional trade payments in Africa are rerouted offshore for clearing and settlements, adding an estimated $5 billion per year to transaction costs, the increased use of LCS would yield significant benefits for the continent. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, launched in 2022 as a complement to the AfCFTA, could be essential to achieving this goal. </p><p data-line-id="09893c044e2c479898520d9370765e39"> At the same time, a multipolar world requires a more democratic system for reserve-currency issuance, drawing on advances in digitalization. This would make the international monetary system more stable and mitigate the perennial shortage of safe assets, which drives capital outflows from the Global South, often at inopportune times, with significant consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth. </p><p data-line-id="1bd2fc0c0545483f8328f133f3ea538c"> Many African countries have recently experienced currency gyrations because of these outflows, with an index combining depreciation against the US dollar and reserve depletion showing that exchange-rate pressures were at a <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/REO/AFR/2023/April/English/ExchangeNote.ashx">six-year peak</a> in Africa in 2022. To help drive the transition toward a multipolar monetary system, a reformed IMF could strengthen the global financial safety net, which would promote the growth of reserve-sharing arrangements and facilitate the multilateralization of LCS arrangements. </p><p data-line-id="7e71989921c94eada73f6264c6967eff"> Lastly, the new international financial system must support the development of liquid secondary markets for sovereign and corporate bonds, which would provide investors with flexibility, security, and a steady stream of income. Given that African countries’ external debt is largely denominated in dollars or euros (the “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/613c7dac-6adf-11e2-9670-00144feab49a">original sin</a>” of sovereign-debt markets), such markets could mitigate foreign-exchange risk and help prevent the sudden stops in capital flows that have pushed African countries experiencing liquidity problems into debt distress, which imposes <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/price-fragmentation-global-economy-shock">huge welfare costs</a>. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/a02dc531-6bd3-5b6d-bdd7-910e3325365d">poverty levels increase by 30%</a>, on average, after a country defaults on its external obligations and remain elevated for a decade. </p><p data-line-id="76641ffd485c4c8fbb862e8a7cff9cae"> But debt need not be a path to default, persistent inequality, and intergenerational poverty. It can be a blessing, as evidenced by the key role it has played in the reconstruction and development of economies around the world. An oft-cited example is the perpetual bond that the United Kingdom issued in 1932, when the government realized that debt-service payments were reducing fiscal space and undermining post-World War I reconstruction. The debt was finally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/03/treasury-repay-war-debts-bonds-uk">redeemed</a> in 2015. </p><p data-line-id="f05af0424a4146258032dd49ff991992"> To be afforded the same opportunity, African sovereigns and corporate entities must be able to borrow reliably on reasonable terms, leaving behind the costly default-driven interest rates to which they have long been subjected. Any reform of the international financial system that does not provide equal access to capital, especially affordable and patient capital to invest in human resources, infrastructure, and the green transition, would be a facelift unacceptable to Africans. </p><p data-line-id="2a82b5a1ceb3455d88d1390bc094e95c"> The good news is that Guterres’s call to reform the global financial system is being well received, even by one-time apostles of the Washington Consensus. In fact, many of these former proponents now acknowledge that one-size-fits-all austerity measures are not appropriate if they ever were. In a much-praised <em>Foreign Affairs </em><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/price-fragmentation-global-economy-shock">article</a>, IMF Managing Director <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/kristalina-georgieva">Kristalina Georgieva</a> deplored the fact that “many countries lack the technology, financial resources, and capacity to successfully contend with economic shocks on their own.” </p><p data-line-id="bd13645afa6d4506975fac47fb4cc7b2"> Ongoing efforts by the World Bank to boost its lending, together with the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/12/18/pr23459-imf-board-governors-approves-quota-increase-under-16th-general-review-quotas">recent decision</a> to increase <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2022/IMF-Quotas">IMF quotas</a> by 50% are steps in the right direction. But more must be done to create an inclusive global financial system that works for all countries and builds climate resilience. Such a system must address the twin problems that prevent Africa, and the Global South more generally, from devising solutions to new development challenges: financial repression and a chronic technological deficit. In today’s “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/can-democracy-survive-polycrisis-artificial-intelligence-climate-change-ukraine-war-by-george-soros-2023-06">polycrisis</a>” world, ensuring that all countries have access to green technology and affordable financing will be essential to combating climate change and providing hope to all who aspire to a fair share of global prosperity. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="b324bd0b2d984c3e93d4d23b65831889"> MILAN – How to strike the right balance between the state and the market, and ensure the proper functioning of both, has been debated for centuries. But Indian author and philanthropist Rohini Nilekani offers an answer that focuses on neither. As the title of her 2022 book, <a href="https://www.samaajsarkaarbazaar.in/"><em>Samaaj, Sarkaar, Bazaar (Society, State, Markets): A Citizen-First Approach</em></a>, suggests, society comes first. </p>
<p data-line-id="8d84e83451c04611afb2346d28bfe7e5"> For Nilekani, a stable, well-functioning, and inclusive society is essential, first, as an end in itself. But it is also crucial for another reason: a healthy civil society is a prerequisite to effective governance and beneficial market outcomes. As she explains, the state and markets carry out important functions but are vulnerable to errors, imbalances, inefficiencies, and failures, such as capture by special interests. This can result in myriad problems, from rising inequality to shortfalls in the provision of public goods. </p>
<p data-line-id="fabdd2bc48cc4f859b42789cfd9ea8df"> That is where society comes in. According to Nilekani, the only effective responses to government or market deficiencies come from civil society, including the values, relationships, and organizations that underpin it. When society is “malfunctioning” – for example, owing to deep polarization or fragmentation – that response mechanism is disrupted, and can even stop working altogether. </p>
<p data-line-id="e346b1053ec141bbbcd288a74e6f7401"> Nilekani’s argument evokes insights from two other thinkers: the economist Albert O. Hirschman and the political scientist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/robert-d-putnam">Robert D. Putnam</a>. Hirschman’s influential 1970 book <a href="https://hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674276604"><em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States</em></a> argued that actors express their dissatisfaction with underperformance in two main ways. They can “exit” (in favor of an alternative) or use their “voice” to apply pressure for change (such as by highlighting their concerns, proposing solutions, or even threatening to take action that would undermine performance further). </p>
<p data-line-id="31cb08d9952b4e1080e86d76afc428ce"> But while it is probably relatively easy to “exit” a firm that is not meeting one’s needs as a consumer – especially if alternatives are readily available – exiting a country is not always a realistic or attractive option, nor equally available to all. More affluent or educated citizens generally have an easier time leaving their country and entering another. People without such advantages might also try to exit a bad situation, but it is likely to be much more difficult; in certain cases, they might even have to risk their lives. </p>
<p data-line-id="bae03a81d02e4bc4b6d408af584869ca"> This might help to explain Nilekani’s focus on the fine detail of the institutions whereby civil society exercises its influence over the state and markets. In her view, one can assume, voice is a more powerful, effective, and broadly accessible response to organizational underperformance than exit. </p>
<p data-line-id="65994309de0c4770a72eecd53505e6cb"> Likewise, Putnam focuses on civil society and community in America. In <a href="http://bowlingalone.com/"><em>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</em></a> and <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Upswing/Robert-D-Putnam/9781982129156"><em>The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again</em></a>, he analyzes the multidimensional decline of community in the United States, providing a detailed account of the deterioration of civil-society institutions in the Gilded Age (from the late 1800s to the early 1900s), their reconstruction in the interwar period, and their decline again 2-3 decades after World War II. These institutions, Putnam argues, must be built from the ground up yet again. </p>
<p data-line-id="2a606519c03d46c3af9a614066372a3a"> Despite their differences, Nilekani, Hirschman, and Putnam all seem to share the belief that a healthy and cohesive civil society, supported by effective institutions, is a prerequisite for effective governance, market regulation, and necessary reforms to the state and the economy. For this mechanism to produce truly effective governance, however, citizens must also understand their own civic responsibility, as well as what it takes for the state (or other organizations) to deliver on their priorities. And, as Nilekani’s work shows, this is far from guaranteed. </p>
<p data-line-id="be6f7f0eae17429daace9fcfb09afd8d"> When Nilekani surveyed Indian voters about what they wanted from their elected representatives, their responses always focused on local-level outcomes, especially with regard to reform and service delivery. Not one person mentioned anything about legislation. But well-crafted, forward-thinking legislation is essential to promote the kind of long-term inclusive growth that benefits all citizens. </p>
<p data-line-id="6d7ad75b8acc463ab67b4aa1a13d2311"> Indians, in particular, should recognize this. India’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/15/indias-supreme-court-delivers-a-rare-setback-for-narendra-modi">activist</a> Supreme Court has used its authority to enforce citizens’ rights to advance consequential <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/the-indian-supreme-court-as-environmental-activist/">environmental</a> and other reforms. Moreover, its public sector has created what many (including me) regard as the world’s best <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/indias-digital-economy-financial-architecture-is-the-best-in-the-world-nobel-laureate-spence-2892278#:~:text=India%20has%20successfully%20developed%20by,finance%20architecture%20in%20the%20world.">digital financial architecture</a>, comprising a biometric identification system and a “unified payments interface,” administered by the <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview">National Payments Corporation of India</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="61ce3d6f65334bbc8d326425eb4dd897"> This architecture – accessible to all citizens – enables not only instant payments, but also direct financial transfers from the government to poorer segments of the population in real time with no intermediaries and thus no “leakage.” It also provides for data mobility across multiple entities, from banks to digital wallets. This process is guided by legislation dictating that all data flows require permission from individuals who are the subjects of the data. Once permission is given, all data must flow, by law, directly from their location to their intended destination. This explains why there are no significant monopolies in India based on control over data. </p>
<p data-line-id="94be9e047b25461a896112b690cfaf5f"> The lesson is that laws and regulatory structures are critical to state activities that produce local-level benefits. If citizens are to push for reforms and interventions that increase efficiency, promote inclusion, and enable entrepreneurship, innovation, and long-term growth, they need to recognize this. The kind of effective civil society Nilekani envisions thus requires civic engagement, empowerment, and education, including an understanding of the rights <em>and </em>responsibilities implied by citizenship. </p>
<p data-line-id="1bb44abe3f514702a72c0bee543874ee"> In a world that is becoming fragmented within and across countries, it is easy to lose hope for social and economic progress. Nilekani does not, and her thoughtful, realistic, and cautiously optimistic blueprint for a healthy society is worthy of attention, reflection, and debate. </p>

<p data-line-id="ff7ff9aa9d1c4609875659d8f15ac9ea"> CAMBRIDGE – The world was stunned, though perhaps not surprised, by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-dead.html">death</a> this month of <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/alexei-navalny">Alexei Navalny</a>, the Russian opposition politician and Kremlin critic, in an Arctic penal colony. The converted gulag in which he died, called “Polar Wolf,” reserved for hardened criminals rather than political prisoners, was known for its <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/polar-wolf-penal-colony-prison-navalny-death-b2499680.html">harsh conditions</a>, and Navalny had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/23/the-last-days-of-alexei-navalny-russia-prison">tortured</a> extensively. </p><p data-line-id="e714b35f377045f1b73642f24c1f85b1"> Still, the circumstances of the sudden death of Navalny – who had made a cheerful <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexey-navalny-video-appears-healthy-day-before-reported-death-in-prison/">court appearance</a> the previous day – were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68318742">mysterious</a>. At 47, Navalny was still young, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/europe/navalny-letters-russia.html">plans</a> he was actively making suggested that he remained hopeful for the future. So, the signs don’t point to a death from “natural causes,” as the Russian authorities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/22/navalny-body-secret-burial-yulia/">claimed</a>. </p><p data-line-id="ac2c21ad799e4865aa204d32bd53f4c7"> Navalny was, of course, living on borrowed time after years exposing the corruption of President Vladimir Putin’s regime. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/chemical-burns-poisoning-prison-alexei-navalny-persecution">most serious attempt on his life</a> – a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/world/europe/navalny-poison-novichok.html">near-fatal poisoning</a> with a military-grade nerve agent, Novichok – failed when he was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-53871617">flown to Germany</a> for emergency treatment. Aware of the fate that awaited him in a country where the line between a prison sentence and a death sentence is dangerously thin, he nonetheless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-alexey-navalny-returned-to-russia">chose to return</a> to Moscow, where he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/alexei-navalny-detained-at-airport-on-return-to-russia#:~:text=Police%20detained%20Navalny%20shortly%20after,Sheremetyevo%2C%20away%20from%20waiting%20media.">arrested on arrival</a> and ultimately handed a 19-year <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/russias-navalny-loses-appeal-against-19-year-jail-term">prison term</a>.  </p>

<p data-line-id="ce4fdf9ae9a04f9fa524c82194ed493c"> WASHINGTON, DC – For about 1,500 years, high-value goods were moved from China (and perhaps other parts of Asia) to Europe and the Middle East via the <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/silk-road/">Silk Road</a>. The precise route varied over time, but it always ran through and involved local traders in parts of what we now call Central Asia.  </p><p data-line-id="be236281f67c4327808de70d78c156e6"> Today, trade through Central Asia is bustling again, with the Caucasus also getting in on the act. But now the boom is in goods moving from the United States, Japan, Western Europe, and China to Russia, via countries such as Armenia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. </p><p data-line-id="744a0ce63418450c89cbcaff05e31d5c"> The G7 democracies are well aware that this trade bolsters Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime and makes it easier for him to sustain his brutal war of aggression in Ukraine. But their governments are doing little to stop it for fear of upsetting domestic industrial interests. As a result, the world’s leading democracies – aided and abetted by intermediary countries – are effectively supporting Russia’s ability to kill Ukrainians. The G7 and the European Union need to strengthen their export controls and ensure meaningful enforcement. </p>

<p data-line-id="75f1ce80e76a48c38e2cbd32457b8473"> MUNICH – In Christopher Nolan’s 2010 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/"><em>Inception</em></a>, the line between reality and illusion becomes increasingly blurred. When it comes to fossil-fuel subsidies, life imitates art. Distinguishing between their perceived benefits and actual impact has proven to be a critical global challenge. </p><p data-line-id="1aef8b2a26fa42a2946873f2848005d1"> While such subsidies may appear beneficial in the short term, they mask the profound environmental and economic consequences of our dependence on fossil fuels. Given the interconnected threats posed by climate change, the question remains: Can we come to terms with reality and make decisions that genuinely benefit both ourselves and our planet? </p><p data-line-id="5e9e3671685f408283a6cbd2a4a00e6f"> Despite the international pledges made at the G20 summit in 2009 and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021 (COP26), along with the European Union’s Green Deal and its eighth <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/environment-action-programme-2030_en">Environment Action Program</a>, fossil-fuel subsidies remain entrenched. According to the European Environment Agency, annual subsidies in the EU hovered <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/fossil-fuel-subsidies">around €56 billion</a> ($61 billion) between 2015 and 2021, with only a few member states taking steps to phase them out. </p><p data-line-id="5e0e7f555982491c8618adccb3000c02"> To be sure, the lack of action is not limited to the EU. The International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/fossil-fuels-consumption-subsidies-2022">recently reported</a> that global fossil-fuel subsidies skyrocketed to more than $1 trillion in 2022, a spike largely attributed to geopolitical shocks like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which significantly disrupted energy markets. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="3c9d3f7875ba43b7a8f3297979ca945b"> The International Monetary Fund paints an even bleaker picture: accounting for the insufficient taxation of carbon dioxide emissions implies that fossil-fuel subsidies surged to a <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/08/22/IMF-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Data-2023-Update-537281">record $7 trillion</a> in 2022. This figure, the equivalent of <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/08/22/IMF-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Data-2023-Update-537281">7.1% of the world’s GDP</a>, surpasses global spending on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/8/back-to-school-which-countries-spend-the-most-on-education-2">education</a> and nearly matches worldwide <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240064911">health-care expenditures</a>. </p><p data-line-id="b2da81c93e95421387c4c1f66307f346"> While subsidies are often viewed as a means to address social inequalities and offer relief to poorer households through reduced food and energy prices, they often have the opposite effect. In reality, these subsidies <a href="https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/publications/specials_fmo/2021_05_19_FuelSubsidies.html">disproportionately benefit</a> wealthier households and perpetuate unequal access to energy. Moreover, they divert crucial public funds from more effective investments that could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and improve infrastructure, social protection, and health-care services, all of which offer greater benefits to low-income communities. </p><p data-line-id="1661270f36b8494dbf406f4898292ad6"> By contrast, the IMF estimates that eliminating these subsidies could prevent 1.6 million premature deaths annually, generate $4.4 trillion in revenues, and accelerate progress toward global climate goals. By maintaining energy subsidies initially designed as temporary measures, we risk perpetuating our dependence on fossil fuels. </p><p data-line-id="35c7a7f04faa43849d078e4383ed2efa"> But given that tackling social inequalities requires a phased approach, a balanced long-term climate strategy must include targeted financial support to vulnerable populations. This could involve expanding welfare programs, retaining universal subsidies for essential goods, and boosting investment in public services that primarily benefit low-income households, such as health care, education, and infrastructure. Means-tested transfers and energy rebates could also facilitate a smoother climate transition. </p><p data-line-id="a27ce1493d164c5583dad68432fcd392"> Similarly, low- and middle-income countries must pursue <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2023/10/10/global-financial-stability-report-october-2023">structural reforms</a> to enhance economic stability, deepen financial markets, and strengthen their institutions, thereby improving their credit ratings and reducing their borrowing costs. Transparent sustainable investment disclosures and strategic use of guarantees could also help these countries mitigate investment risks. </p><p data-line-id="9a33b90705ed42b59cac2f9b15828b29"> The <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/">Green Climate Fund</a> underscores the crucial role of <a href="https://www.allianz.com/en/press/news/commitment/environment/231108-allianz-daring-to-do-more-blended-finance-book-chapter-by-oliver-baete.html">blended finance</a> in helping developing countries decarbonize. Created under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Fund currently manages 216 projects with a <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/gcf-1-progress-report">combined value of $12 billion</a>. When accounting for co-financing, its overall assets exceed $45 billion. </p><p data-line-id="3b40148fb4ec4f86b4a6c81a7ae4ff6f"> The next few years will be critical for the global transition to net-zero emissions, with technological innovations playing a vital role. The EU’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_588">plan</a> to achieve energy independence and a 55% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, for example, depends heavily on the development of a thriving <a href="https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/publications/specials_fmo/climate-technology.html">climate-tech sector</a>. </p><p data-line-id="8960fe2543184c2094604275d9c39208"> But despite the need for rapid emissions reductions, Europe lags behind the United States and China. Our discussions with leaders from European climate-tech companies such as <a href="https://stabl.com/">STABL</a>, <a href="https://www.proximafusion.com/">Proxima Fusion</a>, <a href="https://claimscarbon.com/">Claims Carbon</a>, and <a href="https://www.go-electra.com/en/">Electra</a> underscored the urgency of the situation, which the EU must address by adopting supportive policies to stimulate the sector’s growth. </p><p data-line-id="ab495496d28549f798f545aa351b643c"> A future of sustainable growth is within reach if we acknowledge the real costs of fossil fuels and adjust our financial and political priorities accordingly. To this end, global policymakers must outline their plans for the energy sector, transportation networks, and information systems. By redirecting funds currently allocated to fossil-fuel subsidies, governments could meet their climate targets by 2030 and accelerate the shift to a net-zero economy. </p><p data-line-id="595cb10d01ab48a5a47e6a7a12d485a8"> As climate change worsens, it is increasingly evident that ignoring the devastating consequences of our dependence on fossil fuels is no longer an option. Achieving net-zero emissions requires bold policies such as the phaseout of fossil-fuel subsidies, as well as investment in technological innovation and a global commitment to a fair and equitable energy transition. </p>

<p data-line-id="83c9eac667ac4c1cb3e5882d81a353cb"> WASHINGTON, DC – Amid a cascade of intertwined challenges, including public-health emergencies, climate change, and violent conflict, that threaten to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report">reverse</a> decades of hard-won development progress, the World Bank has introduced an <a href="https://www.devcommittee.org/content/dam/sites/devcommittee/doc/statements/DC-S2023%200068%20DC%20Chair%20Fall%20Statement%20final.pdf">Evolution Roadmap</a> to boost efforts to reduce poverty and inequality. Crucially, the unified and scaled response <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-vision-for-world-bank-by-ajay-banga-2023-07">called for</a> by Bank President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-banga">Ajay Banga</a> includes leveraging knowledge to help countries make more informed and effective decisions. </p><p data-line-id="c0277c6e0a4b4503b3c562c11b342192"> While best known for its financial services, the World Bank has a long history of researching and disseminating the lessons of development. In 1996, then-President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/james-d-wolfensohn">James D. Wolfensohn</a>, recognizing the potential of the information-technology revolution, <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/135801467993234363/pdf/People-and-development-annual-meetings-address-by-James-D-Wolfensohn-President.pdf">urged</a> the institution to function as a “Knowledge Bank.” He emphasized that the World Bank’s relationships with governments and international organizations would allow it to play a leading role in new global partnerships for creating and sharing knowledge. So long as it invested in the necessary systems, the Bank would be able to make more and better information available to its client countries. </p><p data-line-id="bdf9996465134a71b318697d5efef095"> Since then, the World Bank has offered both financial support and knowledge services, including technical assistance, training, capacity-building, policy advice, and data analysis. In fact, many clients consider these services – which capitalize on the Bank’s vast experience, sectoral expertise, and wide array of data sources – to be as valuable as the financial assistance provided by the institution, if not more so. </p>

<p data-line-id="7370da96a7124ae4ae5dd1ccd1e7ee76"> LONDON – Day by day, week by week, courts are increasingly becoming the front line in the struggle to preserve democracy from populists and authoritarians. In the United States, the Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments on a decision by Colorado’s highest court that Donald Trump is ineligible to appear on the state’s presidential ballot, owing to his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. And an appellate court has ruled against Trump’s claim that presidents enjoy immunity for any action taken while in office. </p><p data-line-id="a1fe2536f5bd4a2aa0e00398e52fcbae"> Moreover, a state court in New York has just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/16/donald-trump-financial-fraud-case">imposed</a> a $354 million penalty on Trump for financial fraud. That comes on top of $83 million awarded by the jury in a case where Trump was accused of defaming a woman who had successfully sued him for sexual assault. In addition to barring him from holding any senior role in a New York-based company for the next three years, these two rulings will likely strip Trump of almost all his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/nyregion/trump-civil-fraud-trial-ruling.html">available cash holdings</a>. </p><p data-line-id="c8b877ec0b1c4da5baaa2694f6e25752"> Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom’s Conservative government has been trying to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/uk-lawmakers-pass-a-bill-to-send-migrants-to-rwanda-but-hurdles-remain-before-any-flights-take-off">pass a migrant-relocation bill</a> that is intended to bypass a UK Supreme Court ruling late last year overturning similar legislation. In Israel, the country’s highest court recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-netanyahu.html">struck down</a> an amendment to the Basic Law that would have curtailed its own authority. And in Germany, the Constitutional Court recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-can-cut-funding-far-right-party-rules-court-2024-01-23/">ruled</a> that public funding can be denied to the far-right, anti-democratic Die Heimat party, leading to speculation that it could consider a similar case involving the increasingly popular Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). </p>

<p data-line-id="a024417628184ff88e44071dbded8aa2"> LOMÉ – For decades, the international community has grappled with the challenge of ending extreme poverty, which is the leading Sustainable Development Goal for 2030. Despite some progress, we remain far off track, with an estimated <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview">700 million</a> people still struggling to survive on less than $2.15 per day. Unlike in previous decades, however, we now have a solution that can be scaled up rapidly to accelerate the end of extreme poverty: direct cash transfers to the poorest households. </p><p data-line-id="6623549b44034321b59b3e7dccdfa311"> The concept itself is not new. Cash aid has proven effective, especially in the face of emergencies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of every six people in the world <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/7cdbc28a-22ce-5e86-a4bc-640442d46ef8">received</a> some cash assistance. Direct transfers are powerful tools for helping individuals to take control of their lives and invest in their families’ well-being. That is why high- and middle-income countries are increasingly incorporating cash aid as a central part of their social safety nets. Still, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-cash-transfers-should-be-the-default-not-just-the-benchmark-106220#:~:text=But%20it’s%20easy%20to%20mistake%20coverage%20about%20cash%20transfers%20with%20adoption.%20It’s%20likely%20less%20than%205%25%C2%A0of%20official%20development%20assistance%20goes%20to%20cash%20programming%20—%20though%20no%20one%20is%20tracking%20the%20exact%20amount.">less than 5%</a> of the $200 billion spent annually on international development is allocated to cash transfers. </p><p data-line-id="70830f4534384f1eb6e9fa6944c109e9"> The positive impact of cash transfers is well-documented and undeniable. The upshot from more than <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/cash-evidence-explorer/">300 randomized control trials</a> is that transfers can boost incomes more than twofold; increase school enrollment and entrepreneurship; decrease skipped meals, illness, and depression; and reduce domestic violence. Importantly, they neither reduce hours worked nor increase spending on temptation goods like tobacco and alcohol. Better still, every $1 transfer has a spillover effect of around $2.50 in the local economy. Three years after the transfer, recipients are still earning more and are better educated. Recent <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/">research</a> from Kenya showed that a $500 lump-sum cash transfer was particularly effective in empowering families to make income-generating investments. </p>

Front-page <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/us/politics/fbi-director-china-wray-.html">coverage</a> by the<em> New York Times</em> added to the sense of urgency. </p><p data-line-id="a159b203b96c425088c8391a98a5cf02"> A few days after Wray’s testimony, a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a">joint report</a> from the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) provided detailed documentation of the Volt Typhoon threat. More front-page <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/business/china-leaked-files.html">coverage</a> by the <em>Times</em> duly followed. And then came the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cellular-outage-us-hits-att-t-mobile-verizon-users-downdetector-shows-2024-02-22/">outage</a> of a major cellular network on February 22. Suddenly, cyber fears have taken on a life of their own. </p><p data-line-id="c8064f637d3d41caacc7be306f887e57"> Largely ignored in this frenzy is an important conditionality to Wray’s warning. China, he alleged, was “prepositioning” for future conflict. That is not the same as Russian President Vladimir Putin massing troops on Ukraine’s border in late 2021 and early 2022. In Wray’s words, Volt Typhoon could be expected to attack US critical infrastructure, “<em>If or when</em> China decides the time has come to strike” (my emphasis). </p>

<p data-line-id="d9e06bedb44a4ba38b8a385e91402fe4"> TOKYO – Harvard Professor Ezra Vogel’s 1979 book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Japan_as_Number_One.html?id=lQ1oAAAAIAAJ"><em>Japan as Number One: Lessons for America</em></a>, became an instant bestseller in Japan. The flattering title certainly helped sales, but it was the book’s central argument – that the Japanese approach to governance and business were superior to others – that really made a splash. </p><p data-line-id="d9ce5a0fec924c8daeb62c28c613b2e8"> At the time, Japan was riding high. Its GDP had grown by about 10% annually for most of the 1950s and 1960s, and 4-5% during the second half of the 1970s – a <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538244/the-japanese-economy/">trend</a> that would continue throughout the 1980s. But Japanese businessmen and political leaders were not sure whether Japan had succeeded economically <em>because</em> of its unique system or <em>despite</em> it. For them, Vogel’s book amounted to a kind of seal of approval and reinforced the belief that Japan could soon surpass the United States to become the world’s largest economy. </p><p data-line-id="b4774e589ddf4b978f95af9d8c18b9b6"> In the years that followed, Japan appeared to be progressing toward this goal. In the second half of the 1980s, Japanese <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/book/9781557754622/ch06.xml#:~:text=on%20economic%20growth.-,In%20the%20second%20half%20of%20the%201980s%2C%20Japan's%20stock%20prices,prices%20from%20mid%2D1990%20onward.">stock prices</a> tripled, and real asset prices rose fourfold. In 1988, Japan’s GDP amounted to <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/October">60%</a> that of the US (in current dollars), and, with a population about half the size at the time, its GDP per capita was significantly higher. In 1995, following a sharp appreciation of the yen, Japan’s economy was about <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/October">three-quarters</a> the size of the US economy. </p>

<p data-line-id="671c2031c29346868e4f732d9d8d6a4f"> BERLIN – Since global financial stability ought to be considered a public good, many international institutions devote themselves to establishing the conditions to sustain it. Geopolitical conflict, however, often brings a change in thinking: suddenly, instability becomes a useful tool for protecting one’s own interests in a zero-sum global competition. In our current era of trade wars, cross-border supply chains, and restrictions on access to key technologies – call it “geotechnopolitics” – a newer version of this old dynamic is emerging. If history is any guide, financial war is around the corner. </p><p data-line-id="c8cae5701d9c4d3c8dc1393e5c5b4ed8"> In the twentieth century, both world wars were preceded by the formation of rival blocs and an increase in targeted financial attacks. As diplomatic tensions escalated, each side tried to undermine the other’s capacities through a financial war of attrition. Hence, financial mobilization preceded military mobilization in the run-up to 1914. </p><p data-line-id="33e70cc6e1b7494088ccd6510fd1fbe8"> For example, during the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911, France responded to Germany’s deployment of a gunboat to the coastal city of Agadir by orchestrating a rapid selloff of German securities, triggering financial panic in Germany. At the same time, Austria-Hungary, whose businesses wanted to tap the French capital market, abandoned its German ally and lined up with Paris. As a result, Germany felt less secure about Austrian support and more determined to invent economic issues that would force the Habsburg Empire back to its side. </p>

<p data-line-id="39ad505489d5443e98841de30e783a14"> HONG KONG – The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) are working to establish a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in the territory as soon as possible. Asset managers and fintech firms are reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-29/hong-kong-stablecoin-sandbox-attracts-china-s-harvest-global">following the effort very closely</a>. Other governments should do so as well. </p><p data-line-id="920a9b0c08c04645a4b84d665f254075"> Stablecoins are a type of cryptoasset that is supposed to maintain a value relative to a target currency. “<a href="https://medium.com/@ergoplatform/stablecoins-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work-265c5cf6d53e">Collateralized</a>” stablecoins are backed by a pool of reserve assets, whether fiat currencies, other cryptoassets, or commodities. But not all stablecoins are backed by reserve assets: <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap141.pdf">unbacked</a> stablecoins seek to maintain a stable value by other means, such as through algorithms that limit their supply, creating a market value. </p><p data-line-id="260bd2f3d7b74abd93b63fa673c139c0"> There is currently no universally agreed standard for stablecoins, let alone a regulatory framework governing them. But the market is large – and growing fast. Since the beginning of 2020, the estimated <a href="https://assets.coingecko.com/reports/2023/CoinGecko-2023-Q3-Report-CN.pdf">total market value</a> of stablecoins <a href="https://assets.coingecko.com/reports/2020-Year-End-Report/CoinGecko-2020-Report-CN.pdf">skyrocketed</a> from $5.9 billion to about $130 billion. Stablecoins pegged to the US dollar dominate the market, owing to the US dollar’s enduring global dominance as a means of payment, store of value, and unit of account, as well as the liquidity and convenience of the US dollar asset market. </p>

Together with his success at normalizing the war in terms of Russians’ daily lives – the standard of living is not declining (at least economically) – this allows him to play a long game. </p>

<p data-line-id="14c216bd7050487fad0b5c764a3364db"> OXFORD – In a year when some of the world’s largest democracies are holding elections, all too many are riven by deep political divisions. The headline of a 2020 study of “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe1715">political sectarianism</a>” in the United States warns that a “poisonous cocktail of othering, aversion, and moralization” is corroding collective and civic engagement and causing government dysfunction. And the <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2023-01/2023%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report.pdf">2023 Edelman Trust Barometer</a> documents similar trends in severely polarized countries such as Argentina, Colombia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and the US. </p><p data-line-id="c1e3145d13a54dfbbecb64b68fee0ef5"> The US study found that where people once felt fondly toward fellow party members and merely neutral toward those in the opposing camp, they now fear and hate their opponents. Moreover, Americans today are more opposed to dating, marrying, and even living near someone with different political views, and are more likely to discriminate on the basis of politics in the workplace. Similarly in Turkey, almost <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/10/01/how-to-understand-global-spread-of-political-polarization-pub-79893">eight out of ten people</a> would not want their daughter to marry someone who votes for the party they most dislike. Astonishingly, the US study suggests that political orientation has become so important that people will change their self-identified religion, class, and sexual orientation to align with it.  </p><p data-line-id="a9a45bec95234c3eabf52e81bddbd486"> The results of the Edelman survey are especially worrying. A mere 20% of 32,000 respondents in 28 countries said they would be willing to work with or live in the same neighborhood as a person who strongly disagrees with them or their point of view, while only 30% said they would help such a person if they were in need. </p>

<p data-line-id="cdedfc8e0cd243208b59c60f276a6da1"> CHICAGO – The concentration of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan has raised fears in the United States about the vulnerability of this supply chain should China blockade or invade the island. The US CHIPS and Science Act seeks to address that vulnerability with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/">$52 billion</a> in subsidies to encourage semiconductor manufacturers to relocate to America. But the legislation, as designed, will fall short of its objective; it may even weaken Taiwan’s most important industry, further threatening the island’s security. </p><p data-line-id="7f20eaf46d5b445194a1b802dc3bbcd2"> Today’s semiconductor industry is dominated by specialized companies located around the world. TSMC in Taiwan focuses only on <a href="https://time.com/6102879/semiconductor-chip-shortage-tsmc/">contract manufacturing</a>, primarily of high-end chips, whereas other equally important parts of the semiconductor ecosystem include US companies such as AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm (which only design chips), the lithography specialist ASML in the Netherlands, Japan’s Tokyo Electron (which makes chip-manufacturing equipment), and Britain’s Arm (which produces software used to design chips). </p><p data-line-id="8b97092442ce4dee98f8d07e42716a47"> All this specialization offers two main benefits. First, it means that each part of the global supply chain can focus and improve on what it does best, which benefits other parts of the supply chain. Second, global capacity has increased in all segments of the supply chain, which has made the industry more resilient to demand shocks. </p>

<p data-line-id="b281760fd7354799844ef524954d97db"> CAMBRIDGE – What happens in the United States does not stay in the United States. The global economy depends on America to act as a main engine of growth, and global financial markets depend on US investors’ outsize appetite for risk. This became particularly evident in 2023 when major economies like Japan and the United Kingdom slipped into recession, Germany <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-15/germany-s-economy-shrank-last-year-for-first-time-since-pandemic">narrowly avoided one</a>, and China grappled with obstacles to growth and pockets of high debt. </p><p data-line-id="d3de7fcda5ad454bb13156fa054d261d"> But whether the US economy can drive global growth in 2024 depends on the answers to three key questions. First, can the domestic economy maintain its current growth momentum and achieve the softest of soft landings? Second, can it remain resilient in the face of domestic political divisions and geopolitical uncertainties around the world? And lastly, will investors be able to secure sufficient liquidity to refinance debts accumulated during the era of artificially low interest rates and exceptionally high liquidity injections by central banks? </p><p data-line-id="de5cabaaacab47ab988bf463069d74e7"> Based on current market prices, investors believe the answer to all three questions is a solid yes. Similarly, many economists are optimistic about the US economy, albeit with slightly less enthusiasm than that exhibited by capital markets. </p>

<p data-line-id="f0cf880f75934efdb0c24a33d5052c5f"> WASHINGTON, DC – Last October, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/october/ustr-statement-wto-e-commerce-negotiations">abandoned</a> its longstanding demand for World Trade Organization provisions to protect cross-border data flows, prevent forced data localization, safeguard source codes, and prohibit countries from discriminating against digital products based on nationality. It was a shocking shift: one that jeopardizes the very survival of the open internet, with all the knowledge-sharing, global collaboration, and cross-border commerce that it enables. </p><p data-line-id="f036b8b9e0584703b594e17274d01c4a"> The USTR says that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/">change was necessary</a> because of a mistaken belief that trade provisions could hinder the ability of US Congress to respond to calls for regulation of Big Tech firms and artificial intelligence. But trade agreements already include exceptions for legitimate public-policy concerns, and Congress itself <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32528">has produced research</a> showing that trade deals cannot impede its policy aspirations. Simply put, the US – as with other countries involved in WTO deals – can regulate its digital sector without abandoning its critical role as a champion of the open internet. </p><p data-line-id="fe54679f36f545869ece3ca4d173a5f5"> The potential consequences of America’s policy shift are as far-reaching as they are dangerous.

Now, those who have heard the siren song of supposed “<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2022/navigating-digital-sovereignty-and-its-impact-on-the-internet/">digital sovereignty</a>” as a means to ensure their laws are obeyed in the digital realm have less reason to resist it. The more digital walls come up, the less the walled-off portions resemble the internet. </p>

<p data-line-id="88c26f83e229432caec69fc38cbd70d0"> CAMBRIDGE – On-campus activities at Senegal’s Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD), one of Africa’s largest institutions of higher education, have been <a href="https://africasacountry.com/2024/02/elections-on-university-off">suspended</a> since last June, when students protested violently against the jailing of the country’s main opposition leader. The prolonged closure has made life difficult for UCAD students, many of whom normally reside on campus, and disrupted operations, because online classes are not widely available. </p><p data-line-id="a889d1512b4340d0b1c86e5a1de90e3a"> The learning gaps that have become visible are exacerbating inequities, fueling social tensions, and threatening the reputation of Senegal’s higher-education system. Calls to reopen UCAD have grown louder, but worsening political conditions – led by the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240222-senegal-s-macky-sall-leaves-date-open-for-delayed-presidential-election">postponement</a> of the presidential election – all but preclude it. </p><p data-line-id="93bab85c08db4fb297c756a448462c6d"> UCAD is far from the only African institution of higher learning in crisis. Recent strikes by students and teacher unions have affected public colleges and universities in <a href="https://theconversation.com/17-strikes-in-23-years-a-unionist-explains-why-nigerias-university-lecturers-wont-back-down-190170">Nigeria</a>, <a href="https://thebftonline.com/2024/01/30/gaua-nationwide-strike-continues/">Ghana</a>, <a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/striking-university-of-pretoria-employees-allegedly-deny-students-access-to-campus-20240219">South Africa</a>, and other countries. These strikes reflect diverse agendas, from political activism to demands for better pay, higher cost-of-living allowances, improved working conditions, and more financial aid for students. </p>

<p data-line-id="668ee7a695d34a7c95ac91b6dcdfe4c4"> SINGAPORE/LONDON – The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) concluded with a <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era#:~:text=UN%20Climate%20Change%20News%2C%2013,cuts%20and%20scaled%2Dup%20finance.">landmark agreement</a> to shift away from fossil fuels and triple the world’s renewable-energy capacity. While this is a step in the right direction, how can we ensure that emerging economies have the necessary resources to achieve a just clean-energy transition?  </p><p data-line-id="6c8d70932a1b43a78aeb305a4e616749"> That question has become a pressing one in Southeast Asia. In 2021, at COP26 in Glasgow, eight of the ten ASEAN countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – unveiled their updated emissions-reduction plans, <a href="https://accept.aseanenergy.org/aseans-emerging-mission-for-a-low-carbon-energy-transition/">setting</a> ambitious decarbonization targets for 2030 and pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a decade sooner than they originally planned. But the past two years have highlighted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/renewable-energy-costs-affordable-enough-asean-the-business-times-ofxxc">massive investments</a> required to build green infrastructure in these developing economies. The International Renewable Energy Agency <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2022/Sep/IRENA_Renewable_energy_outlook_ASEAN_2022.pdf?rev=ef7557c64c3b4750be08f9590601634c">estimates</a> that the bloc’s member states will require an average annual investment of $210 billion up to 2050 to meet their climate goals. </p><p data-line-id="fe7b7bbcf727449188da24458a9921c8"> It is now abundantly clear that no single country or bloc can achieve net-zero emissions on its own, and that a just energy transition will require robust public-private partnerships. According to a <a href="https://www.ifc.org/content/dam/ifc/doc/2023-delta/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-edmes-summary-en.pdf">2023 report</a> by the International Finance Corporation and the International Energy Agency, Southeast Asian countries need $9 billion in concessional financing per year until 2031-35 to mobilize the necessary private capital to decarbonize their economies. </p><p data-line-id="ef99f9e81b4e474f8047ee92ae396072"> Southeast Asia, with its numerous island communities and vast coastal areas, is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. Its carbon dioxide emissions <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/asia-global-transition-net-zero-asian-development-outlook-2023-thematic-report-april-2023">doubled</a> between 1990 and 2020, reflecting rapid economic growth, and energy demand is expected to <a href="https://seads.adb.org/solutions/asean-energy-outlook-calls-accelerated-transition#:~:text=Energy%20demand%20in%20Southeast%20Asia,Centre%20for%20Energy%20(ACE).">triple</a> by 2050, underscoring the need for innovative and cost-effective technological solutions. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="15dded01090d4ce182b36ff8336539a2"> At the same time, the growing frequency of extreme weather events, reduced agricultural yields, deteriorating health conditions, and declining tourism underscore the devastating impact of climate change on Southeast Asian economies. The Asian Development Bank <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/178615/sea-economics-global-climate-stabilization.pdf">projects</a> that global warming could erode the region’s GDP by 11% by the end of the century, while Swiss Re estimates that GDP losses could be <a href="https://www.swissre.com/risk-knowledge/mitigating-climate-risk/economics-of-climate-change-impacts-for-asia.html">as high as 37%.</a></p><p data-line-id="f3a1a203519b4677a35dc63fdf7ebec1"> Recognizing the urgent need for climate action, several Southeast Asian countries have recently announced a series of climate partnerships with international organizations and investors. During COP28, for example, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company, signed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/indonesia-state-power-firm-pln-signs-14-clean-energy-deals-during-cop28-2023-12-15/">14 strategic agreements</a> to accelerate the integration of renewable energy into the country’s power grid, shut down coal-fired power plants, and develop worker training programs. </p><p data-line-id="665bef77fec1402f9abc18c70911d5b8"> Vietnam, acutely aware of its vulnerability to climate change, has taken steps to promote equitable climate solutions. In May 2023, the country approved its new power development plan, <a href="https://greenfdc.org/vietnams-eight-national-power-development-plan-pdp8/">PDP8</a>, which aims to boost wind and gas capacity and reduce reliance on coal. It also joined the <a href="https://poweringpastcoal.org/news/cop28-opens-with-remarkable-international-actions-on-coal-phase-out/">Coal Transition Accelerator</a>, in which Indonesia, Malaysia, and several Western countries share knowledge, develop new policies, and unlock public and private financing to facilitate its shift away from coal. </p><p data-line-id="b4bdd1cfbac943f98321863797868b46"><a></a>While Southeast Asian governments have endorsed numerous clean-energy initiatives on their own, a coordinated approach is the key to ensuring a just energy transition that stimulates economic growth. By fostering cooperation between the public and private sectors, ASEAN countries could gain access to the capital and expertise necessary to mitigate perceived risks and transform capital-intensive projects into viable, investible ventures. </p><p data-line-id="ab773e9d6c464c2aa5ebcbff6557cf48"> But Southeast Asia’s shift to renewable energy requires a concerted global effort as well. By 2050, relatively energy-poor emerging economies are expected to account for <a href="https://energyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GEAPP_P3_PDF_report_120122.pdf">75% of global emissions</a>. To meet the world’s climate targets, the international community must support these countries’ decarbonization efforts. </p><p data-line-id="0f98e2696cd645599900b28c7f494335"> Historically, large corporations and state-owned enterprises have received the lion’s share of climate finance in Southeast Asia. But the clean-energy transition enables ASEAN countries to redirect capital flows toward small and medium-size enterprises, thereby supporting the region’s burgeoning startup ecosystem, creating green jobs, and fostering sustainable prosperity. </p><p data-line-id="86ab15b5fa4e45faae75996a37e8ebc6"> Given that concessional capital is a finite resource, especially when it comes to funding energy-transition projects, it is crucial to establish appropriate financing structures capable of mobilizing early-stage capital. Fortunately, this scarcity offers a unique opportunity to mobilize private-sector participation by leveraging philanthropic capital. Bridging the gap between philanthropy and investment could help promote the development of new technologies and business models that are on the cusp of commercial viability. </p><p data-line-id="822930d117d54ca2bfb7e844fa586f68"> Philanthropic investors with the ability to mobilize private capital have a crucial role to play in advancing Southeast Asia’s energy transition. Through blended finance, they could help demonstrate the viability of emerging technologies, businesses, and projects. To be sure, this approach goes beyond philanthropy’s conventional scope. But by endorsing and structuring transactions that attract development finance, philanthropic funds could catalyze private financial flows. </p><p data-line-id="8168120f01c242c09612ca9ea0e6b540"> The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Fund II (SEACEF II) is a prime <a href="https://energyalliance.org/clime-capital-announces-first-close-of-seacef-ii/">example</a>. In December, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet invested $10 million in SEACEF II, taking a junior equity position and agreeing to cover the first losses. With $127 million in commitments, it is the first blended investment fund dedicated to providing early-stage, high-risk capital to clean-energy startups in Southeast Asia. Its innovative approach highlights the potential role of catalytic, risk-tolerant financing in advancing an inclusive net-zero transition. </p><p data-line-id="58489f1980574c65bef0406371925f83"> Closing the climate-financing gap is crucial to achieving net-zero emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/solving-the-climate-finance-equation-for-developing-countries">McKinsey report</a> estimates that developing countries must invest roughly $2 trillion annually by 2030 to meet their climate targets. By adopting a radically collaborative investment approach, philanthropic funds, governments, financial institutions, and private investors could foster an equitable and economically viable transition to clean energy – in Southeast Asia and around the world. </p>

<p data-line-id="5abecdf988214ede9050bcf73c30fc10">At a recent campaign rally, Donald Trump told his supporters that, during his presidency, he had warned a leader of a “big” NATO country that, if the alliance’s European members did not meet their military-spending obligations, the United States would not defend them from attack. On the contrary, it would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell” it wanted to them.</p><p data-line-id="9ee8b2aa2d344f939496a7e7660a3ff6">For former German vice chancellor <strong>Joschka Fischer</strong>, the message is clear: “the end of NATO and the American security guarantee” may be near, so Europe “no longer has any choice but to become a military and political power in its own right.” To this end, it needs “a common foreign policy, a joint military capability, a European nuclear umbrella, and everything else that forms the basis of meaningful sovereign power in the twenty-first century,” though Europeans remain “unwilling to accept this fact.”</p><p data-line-id="3dc8e45526674d8985c3ca57d68de8a8"><strong>Philippe Legrain</strong> of the London School of Economics’ European Institute agrees: “Instead of merely hoping for a best-case scenario” – that is, the re-election of President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>, who would continue to “support Ukraine and uphold America’s defense commitments” – “Europe must prepare for the worst.” While “European rearmament may seem drastic,” he notes, “the stakes are existential.”</p><p data-line-id="b38a80583cc845d9986a286990b25da3">In European Council on Foreign Relations Director <strong>Mark Leonard</strong>’s view, Trump might be doing Europe a favor. In fact, by forcing Europeans “finally to rethink the core assumptions that have been hamstringing them with regard to the war in Ukraine, Europe’s own defense, and European political unity,” Trump “could end up becoming the European project’s unwitting savior” – but only if Europeans get their act together.</p><p data-line-id="d4a94ee3ee7f45cd8064e55fa7c79ab4">Unfortunately, laments <strong>Daniela Schwarzer</strong> of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, that has not yet happened. At this year’s Munich Security Conference, “European leaders missed yet another opportunity to show how they plan to strengthen NATO’s European pillar and develop a robust European defense industry.” If Europe does not “pull itself together on defense” before this July’s NATO summit, “2024 may be remembered as the year when Ukraine was abandoned, and the transatlantic alliance shattered, with dire consequences for Europe and the world.”</p>

<p data-line-id="4a7032c867474655a5cca125579eadeb"> SEOUL – Few experts doubt that foreign direct investment can bolster economies by bringing in critical know-how, expanding local production, and creating jobs. It is no surprise, therefore, that attracting FDI has long been a top priority for developed and developing economies alike, as reflected in the generous incentives included in the United States’ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. But, when it comes to driving economic growth and development, FDI has a mixed record. </p><p data-line-id="0b9fcc5ab5e74eb69a74be0b76ab68c7"> To understand why, it is worth looking at the contrasting experiences of Penang, Malaysia, and Shenzhen, China. Thanks to its strategic location, low labor costs, and favorable taxes, Penang was among the first Asian cities to attract investment from multinationals, including through its Free Industrial Zone, established in 1972. Later, Shenzhen also began courting FDI, establishing its Special Economic Zone in 1980 – and quickly became a hub of labor-intensive manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="8e5c96e051ac440ea24666a00dbabab0"> But, when it comes to converting that early FDI into income growth and technological upgrading, Shenzhen has been far more successful than Penang. As the chart shows, in 2017, Shenzhen’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162521007058">per capita GDP</a> stood at $39,245 in purchasing-power-parity terms (72% that of the US), compared to just $27,569 (about 50% that of the US) in Penang. Whereas Penang has been slow in growing out of low-value-added manufacturing, Shenzhen has cultivated a thriving high-tech sector. The <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040162521007058">number of US patents</a> registered to inventors with an address in Shenzhen increased from zero in the 1990s to about 2,500 in 2017, whereas Penang had reached just 100. </p>

<p data-line-id="6a30a942c1504530a439d612fc9e7a53"> CAMBRIDGE – The United States is in unusually good economic shape nowadays – no recession in sight. But it seems to be enduring a “vibecession”: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">public-opinion surveys</a> show broad dissatisfaction with the economy and US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s stewardship. What explains this disconnect between performance and perception? At least six answers – some far more credible than others – have been advanced. </p><p data-line-id="31e7be46ceb24c248e8a06467b14cb4f"> The first is that there is <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1665007599224516609?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">no disconnect</a> at all; the positive economic indicators are wrong or misleading, and the true state of the US economy is as poor as public opinion indicates. This explanation is simply wrong. While any given number can be subject to measurement error, a wide variety of statistics – covering <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product#:~:text=Real%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP,in%20consumer%20spending%20and%20exports.">economic growth</a>, labor-market strength (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">jobs created</a> or <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">unemployment</a>), and inflation (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi">consumer price index</a> or <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change">personal consumption expenditures</a>, either headline or <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate">core</a>) – have been collected, largely separately. And they overwhelmingly paint a very positive picture. </p><p data-line-id="024cc115ee6845bc895220c25e81cce0"> The second possible <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1756304442276602225">explanation</a> – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/opinion/economy-survey-republicans.html">offered</a> by economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-krugman">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href="https://www.briefingbook.info/p/asymmetric-amplification-and-the">others</a> – is that the negative <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=75026">survey results</a> reflect Republican partisanship. Though one might assume that Democrats and Republicans are equally partisan, Republican poll respondents actually tend to be much more heavily influenced by which party controls the White House. When Republican Donald Trump succeeded Democrat Barack Obama, Republicans were suddenly reporting far higher satisfaction with the economy. When Democrat Biden took over, they again became fixated on the supposed economic deprivation of American households. Poll responses by Democrats tend to follow economic indicators more closely. </p>

<p data-line-id="87ebb1277f2f4d8a90a6d1cb6a354608"> CAMBRIDGE – One of the defining economic challenges of our time is how to distribute the value generated by groundbreaking technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence and recent innovations in biomedicine and manufacturing, which rely on massive computing power. To improve living standards, the benefits of transformative technologies must be widely shared. So far, however, these benefits have been monopolized by a small cadre of tech billionaires. </p><p data-line-id="6b0a263c24e146fc86842de04bcac017"> Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a prime example. Most people recognize that Musk did not deserve the $56 billion in annual compensation that the company’s board of directors attempted to give him in 2018, given Tesla’s relatively modest profits and years of losses. Nevertheless, the board <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/case-against-elon-musks-56-billion-pay-package-2024-01-30/">argued</a> that this enormous sum was necessary to incentivize Musk to remain at the company – an argument so baseless that a Delaware judge recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-rules-favor-plaintiffs-challenging-musks-tesla-pay-package-2024-01-30/">invalidated</a> the board’s “unfathomable” compensation package. </p><p data-line-id="db1b045676694c61bcc65660c6eb953f"> But Musk is hardly alone. Other tech behemoths, such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/22/alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichais-compensation-topped-200-million-in-2022.html">Alphabet</a> (Google’s parent company), have similarly lavished their CEOs with hefty salaries and stock options under the guise of retaining top talent. In reality, however, the actual contribution of star executives is often unclear. Notably, a <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/1991%20JLEO%20Holmstrom%20Milgrom.pdf">classic 1991 study</a> by Nobel laureate economists Bengt Holmström and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-milgrom-1">Paul Milgrom</a> suggests that incentive pay works only with simple tasks that have measurable outcomes and are executed by a single worker; in such cases, compensation can be directly linked to individual performance. </p>

<p data-line-id="f99cfd7144dc4ed484ac4586170c2822"> NEW YORK – Every country is eager to attract foreign direct investment – and for good reason. FDI facilitates capital inflows, creates jobs, drives skills development, and facilitates technology transfers, accelerating economic growth and enabling recipient countries to access global markets. </p><p data-line-id="fe025a8b01a548b491d6af8a5d074fa4"> But global competition for FDI is fierce. To attract it, governments around the world have liberalized their foreign-investment policies, established investment-promotion agencies, and provided multinational firms with numerous incentives. Now, the World Trade Organization is on the verge of introducing a new mechanism to facilitate FDI flows: the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/archive_e/infac_arc_e.htm">Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement</a> (IFDA). </p><p data-line-id="4e21fd18dcd741b0b3c13304d2980119"> The concept of an investment-facilitation mechanism was <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3842713">first proposed in 2015</a>. After years of preparations, WTO members began negotiations in September 2020, with developing countries taking the lead. More than 120 member countries endorsed the IFDA’s text in November 2023 – an accelerated timeline underscoring developing countries’ urgent need to attract FDI to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>

<p data-line-id="c070689308c04b3986d889cd43c2337e"> KYIV – February 24, 2022, when Russia marched hundreds of thousands of troops into Ukraine, marked the beginning of a major geopolitical earthquake. For two years, Europe has been living with the grim reality of the continent’s largest war of aggression since World War II, and with widespread, horrifying atrocities. </p><p data-line-id="5b90a41b6b91478c93b38416725ed8b6"> What Russia is doing is a classic example of nineteenth-century-style imperial and colonial aggression. Ukraine is enduring what many other countries have cruelly suffered in the past. For Russia, this war has never been about Ukraine’s neutrality, NATO enlargement, protecting Russian-speakers, or any other fabricated pretexts.  </p><p data-line-id="8e49e336cdaa404eb54d51ae2f052bc4"> Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine does not exist as a nation and that Ukrainian identity is artificial. The war is solely about annihilating an independent country, conquering land, and re-establishing dominance over a people that decided to be masters of their own destiny. Russia’s imperial ambition is doubtless familiar to many nations around the world that were previously subject to colonial rule and oppression. </p>

<p data-line-id="d9588768d3184b08a067b6b40a3bb6a2"> CAMBRIDGE – As the crypto winter thaws, and financial institutions renew their interest in digital assets, an old debate has re-emerged over whether blockchain is truly a “trust machine,” as <em>The Economist </em><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/31/the-trust-machine">described</a> it in 2015. </p><p data-line-id="45429e5136fb439ca0670f2d39b78d36"> A figure from fifteenth-century Venice can help answer that question. Though he was neither a technologist nor a banker, the friar Luca Pacioli is remembered today for developing the <a href="https://www.stptax.com/luca-pacioli-the-father-of-accounting/">double-entry bookkeeping accounting system</a> that underpins much of the modern economy. It was his ingenious model that introduced debits and credits to the method of recording transactions in two separate accounts. </p><p data-line-id="ec978a52aa54454c9e0f57197e1e2cf6"> This seemingly boring and cumbersome tweak to a core business function didn’t just ensure accuracy and curb fraud; it also gave owners new insights into how to run and improve their businesses and cut costs. Under Pacioli’s system, efficiencies soared, commerce accelerated, and the Renaissance took flight. Double-entry accounting became a <a href="https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/2019/4/26/how-double-entry-bookkeeping-changed-the-world">cornerstone</a> of economic activity because it was simple, easily shared, and undeniably useful. Centuries later, financial statements based on Pacioli’s work became mandatory for any business. Such is the power of a basic infrastructure upgrade. </p>

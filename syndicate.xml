<p data-line-id="63392522b4fe4f628b256bc12d08daba"> WASHINGTON, DC – As the world continues to experience a prolonged period of unanticipated inflation caused by economic and non-economic shocks over the past four years, it is time for a frank reassessment of central banking and monetary policy. It is time to acknowledge what we got right and where we went wrong, to recognize the limits of our data and understanding, and to own up to the weaknesses of our models and frameworks. Above all, it is a time for humility – and for a return to core goals. </p><p data-line-id="f8784fff89424951b4f140e9fc4f7a5e"> Central banks cannot solve all that ails our economies. They should not be expected to solve problems that other actors can better address, such as collective global goals outside their competence. Instead, central banks and their leaders should focus on three objectives: price stability, financial stability, and macroeconomic stability. Achieving these three goals is hard enough. We should dial back public expectations that central banks can or should do more than this. </p><p data-line-id="c79ac88b22cb408e8310a889fe394fd0"> What does a humble approach to central banking mean in practice? For starters, central banks need to be more realistic about their ability to forecast macroeconomic outcomes with great precision. Their recent track record has demonstrated this. If we look at the Federal Reserve Board and the “hair” diagram, as inflation jumped, staff economists repeatedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-registers-gains-powell-may-take-lay-low-approach-2023-08-25/">projected</a> a return to 2% inflation from wherever the current estimate stood. Again and again, the forecasts were wrong – and in both directions. </p><figure data-line-id="1386833fc00c4e4ea2b3e0d180a67226"><img data-image="ab7npy1mij6o" src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/995306c06b37ed27695f8c3ddc56f7b4.png"/></figure><p data-line-id="ad0023ba5b484b00a57f190e21fb199d">Other central banks have suffered similar forecasting failures as the return to the inflation anchor of 2% is “baked in” in most forecasting models. Advanced-economy central banks and their leaders misread the early indications of the inflationary spike with which we are still grappling, owing to the wrongheaded belief that the emerging price hikes were transitory. This led to a lag in monetary-policy responses, which exacerbated the height of the inflationary spike and the economic pain that ensued, and ultimately required historically steep interest-rate hikes.<br/></p><p data-line-id="0247fee9a7ee475fb336b9249f69db79"> Policy planning and decision-making were muddied further by the adoption of new or adjusted monetary-policy frameworks during the previous prolonged period of low inflation. These models contained assumptions that slowed responses when exogenous shocks (the pandemic), supply shocks (the trade impacts), and fiscal shocks (the size and persistence of the stimulus that was triggered) adversely impacted inflationary pressures and outcomes. </p><h2 data-line-id="038f7940bb9c4509b6bfa3ca9e364198"><strong>First Things First</strong></h2><p data-line-id="c512e9387db94809b1cf093fd140cdd0"> A key part of adopting a humble approach to central banking would require policymakers to return to fundamental, time-tested principles of macro- and monetary economics. In particular, policymakers must avoid overreliance on specific predictive models of inflation. Ideally, central banks should develop frameworks that achieve reasonable forecast results, regardless of the nature of the shock hitting the economy, and they should communicate the degree of uncertainty to the markets and the public. In doing so, they can preserve the option of shifting policy stances as circumstances change, rather than promising long periods of policy stasis based on problematic assumptions. </p>
<p data-line-id="99361cd377874a2da31713ab33f60332"> A humble approach would also require that central banks’ preserve future policy space. In this recent suboptimal policymaking cycle, we all witnessed leading central banks locking themselves into policy stances that constrained their ability to act swiftly via long-term policy commitments when the economic situation shifted suddenly, particularly when inflation reared its head. We believe central banks should tilt toward simpler and more transparent rules, rather than implementing drastic long-term discretionary measures that threaten to undermine their ability to act in the future. </p><p data-line-id="fa80ceecefd24bfab36f38445328c390"> Crucially, embracing the humble approach requires central banks to maintain their focus on the inflation anchor, typically set at 2%. All major central banks – the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and others – have converged on the 2% target. Now is not the time to question or lose sight of that objective. Suggesting doctrinal flexibility or raising inflation targets at a time of higher price growth and ongoing worries over long-term expectations is the wrong answer. Central banks must remain committed to preventing inflation from spiraling out of control, and their credible commitment to an inflation anchor is central to achieving that objective. </p><p data-line-id="0652ca6fc6494a22bb736bf5173d9836"> Reputation is like a capital stock. The central bank can temporarily let inflation run above target if it fears the consequences of raising rates will be too severe, but its reputation for competence will be eroded. If the public’s view of the central bank becomes sufficiently negative, inflation expectations could stray from the target, possibly leading to price spiral. That would be a terrible outcome, and one that can and must be avoided. </p><h2 data-line-id="611761e778de4a059902b264f1a3f602"><strong>Avoiding Financial Dominance</strong></h2><p data-line-id="e1454cee21d6412a8f32229a0d905803"> Some pundits now believe that the worst is behind us, and that we can relax. We do not agree. Around the world, public debt levels are high, and with interest rates rising and payments growing, issues of debt sustainability have come to the fore. Tensions between the necessity for tighter monetary and fiscal policies and governments’ desire to relieve the pain will thus emerge and grow. </p><p data-line-id="ba21e0b090ad4654a84ebcd837693e41"> Governments may be encouraged to put political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates low or lower than is needed. As costs loom for the public and governments, a “blame game” will surely arise, in which policymakers attempt to avoid culpability for inflation. We must be clear on the absolute necessity of controlling inflation, even in the face of political brickbats and attacks. Only by doing so can central banks ensure their public support and continued credibility. </p>

<p data-line-id="d04178ad3fb84ff0b3bdaf712b189d67"> Given high private debt and leverage levels, we worry about the emergence of a new regime of “financial dominance.” In this situation, central banks may be loath to tighten monetary policy because of worries about the risks to the stability of financial markets, which have become perhaps too reliant on central-bank support. The <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/snapshot-the-ripple-effects-of-2023-bank-failures">bank failures</a> in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2023 demonstrated this link, and the prolonged nature of central-bank support may still hide sources of financial instability when policymakers finally withdraw support from addicted firms and sectors. </p><p data-line-id="658314cc46d4425ca38f49c4dbcd3f21"> Central bankers are right to worry about such risks, which partly reflect their own past actions. Looking ahead, to avoid succumbing to financial dominance, central bankers will need to turn to their supervisory staff to deal with the negative spillover effects of past monetary-policy largesse as rates tighten. </p><h2 data-line-id="2a8048e0e091409c83f17bff9f6824b2"><strong>Independence Is Everything</strong></h2><p data-line-id="bf9c65ae162642b3ace274e89572a31d"> To achieve their core goals, central banks require independence from political interference. With independence comes a heavy burden of responsibility, and this is a key reason why central bankers must accept the deliberately narrow mandate that the humble approach implies. </p><p data-line-id="c582c6f1011442b8a2024c4fdfa4d6ec"> Independence is also best served when central banks communicate their policies clearly and effectively, and there has been progress in this domain in the US, Europe, and elsewhere. It is appropriate that central-bank governors testify to legislators and answer questions raised by elected officials. The public and other market participants need to understand why and when central bankers decide to act. </p><p data-line-id="6a28d272ef7d4921bd005c09c8036c51"> The real test for central-bank independence comes when necessary monetary-policy tightening causes public-debt levels and payments to rise. As governments confront hard fiscal decisions, the danger to central-bank independence increases. We know what a lack of independence looks and feels like. Ask any resident of <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">Argentina</a> or <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/inflation-cpi">Turkey</a> about the sky-high inflation that has become a painful fact of daily life. The economic effects are real, impoverishing, and socially devastating. Those of us from small open economies (like Israel) can remember the corrosive economic effects of inflation, as well as the dramatic positive effects of the return to price stability. </p><p data-line-id="526ba68f61bc413bb45ad826cf3351fe"> Crucially, once inflation is allowed to take hold, if independence and credibility are lacking, people’s inflationary expectations for the future are adversely affected, and the results can be deeply harmful. Only with operational independence can central banks continue to fulfill their price stability and other related mandates, learn from policy mistakes, address ongoing inflationary pressures, and chart a way forward, mindful of emerging and morphing risks. </p><p data-line-id="b8b1c70a5f8a4b848e9d1ac46b396355"> Here, we can learn a valuable lesson from emerging-market central banks. The improved resilience and performance of emerging markets is due in part to the lessons learned from their severe debt and macroeconomic crises in previous years. While advanced-economy central bankers delayed responding to the recent bout of inflation, believing that it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/transitory-inflation/#:~:text=The%20Fed%20Promised%20Inflation%20Would%20be%20Transitory&amp;text=Fed%20Chair%20Jerome%20Powell%20and,when%20economies%20were%20shut%20down.">transitory</a>, (and thereby raising the cost and monetary-policy pain needed in the end), emerging-market central banks <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/423dbe48-5b0b-4998-b206-8ba8e3392d12">acted early</a> as the inflationary impulse was becoming visible, hiked rates aggressively, and quickly halted and reversed inflation. </p><p data-line-id="93b6767cf189415a96b135b9a2ca270b"> As advanced-economy central bankers assess their recent policy responses, failures, and lessons learned, they should recognize where others got it right and where they got it wrong. Humility requires nothing less. </p><p data-line-id="5e7e0cd7cdcb4c12a8c7567553ec8a7d"><em>The commentary draws on a recent </em><a href="https://group30.org/images/uploads/publications/G30_Monetary-Policy_Report_Final.pdf"><em>G30 study</em></a><em>, </em>Central Banking and Monetary Policy: Principles and the Way Forward<em>.</em></p><p data-line-id="a6e8247726bc420da8c3b74cb825b141"><em>Markus Brunnermeier, Professor of Economics at Princeton University, contributed to this commentary.</em></p>

    <br/> <span itemprop="abstract">
<p data-line-id="dbe4fdc6abb04ac89eb9be38bd4a9537">Before last October’s parliamentary election in Poland, hopes were high that the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which had spent the previous eight years building an “illiberal democracy,” would be defeated. But few expected that <a href="https://www.ndi.org/publications/major-voter-turnout-poland-s-2023-parliamentary-elections">more than 74%</a> of voters would show up at the polls – the highest turnout in the country since the fall of communism in 1989 – to deliver victory to a pro-democratic coalition of opposition parties.</p><p data-line-id="0d57db569ee14d69ae327b1eafd4f3b1">According to former Polish Deputy Prime Minister <strong>Jacek Rostowski</strong>, the mobilization came just in time, because “the longer authoritarians are in power, the more likely they are to stay in power by implementing policies and procedures to make it less likely that ordinary people will challenge their authority.” But PiS – and its “soon-to-be-deposed little ‘Big Man,’” Jarosław Kaczyński – has seen its authority to use violence or force “evaporate,” even before the formal transfer of power takes place.</p><p data-line-id="5c6ab9aef4634daaaf0533a07a1376fe">But whereas Polish opposition parties “united around a common cause,” writes <strong>Soňa Muzikárová</strong>, a former senior adviser to Slovakia’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, “Slovakian centrists failed to connect with rural voters, older voters, and those disillusioned with the status quo.” This allowed the left-populist party Smer-Social Democracy to eke out a narrow victory in parliamentary elections and return to power Robert Fico, whose previous government was riddled with corruption and ties to organized crime.</p><p data-line-id="e5158499f7ff435cb74f936a719313e8">Europe has another populist problem. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ far-right Freedom party rocketed to victory in last month’s general election. For <strong>Chris Patten</strong>, Chancellor of the University of Oxford, this experience demonstrates that the “allure of populist authoritarianism” grows “when governments fail to deliver moderate and sensible responses to immigration,” as well as “in periods of economic stress, particularly when democratic governments are unable to improve living standards.”</p><p data-line-id="c54ef07939e84158a5783419464e6ba6">But <strong>Ian Buruma</strong> sees a different lesson in Wilders’ victory. Like many ultra-nationalists, Wilders is an outsider, whose grandparents “left the Dutch East Indies under a cloud of financial malfeasance.” These “Eurasians, or Indos as they were called, were never fully accepted by the Indonesians or their Dutch colonial masters,” Buruma explains. “Wilders may not be a fascist, but his obsession with sovereignty, national belonging, and cultural and religious purity has a long lineage among outsiders.”</p><p data-line-id="b18bb7173e104433b502d4ff536b730d">All of this holds lessons for the United States. For starters, MIT’s <strong>Daron Acemoglu</strong> argues, preventing Donald Trump – a “<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/09/politics/analysis-donald-trump-indictment/index.html" target="_blank">twice-impeached</a> former president who now faces <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictments-details-guide-charges-trial-dates-people-case/" target="_blank">four separate indictments</a> for serious crimes” – from returning to the White House will require the Democrats to start “reconnecting with working-class voters and supporting their long-neglected interests.” The stakes are high, Acemoglu says, because a “second Trump presidency would be a much greater threat to democracy than the first.”</p><p data-line-id="fca8667b207f45d38b70a482fcd28b1e">But the University of Chicago’s <strong>Eric Posner</strong> suggests that we should not exaggerate the threat Trump poses. He “was not a fascist when he was president, and he would not become a dictator if elected again,” owing to the “power of constitutional and bureaucratic hurdles” and a “dearth of sympathetic right-wing radicals.” A “second Trump term won’t be pretty,” but “anarchy is more likely than tyranny.”</p>

<p data-line-id="50dc0de05f764bc79feb23adbe4729f4"> BOGOTÁ – The global economic agenda has been packed in 2023. There was the <a href="https://hlpf.un.org/2023">United Nations High-Level Political Forum</a> in July, dedicated to monitoring progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. The second <a href="https://migrationnetwork.un.org/events/2023-sdg-summit#:~:text=Headquarters%2C%20New%20York-,The%202023%20SDG%20Summit%20took%20place%20on%2018%2D19%20September,General%20Assembly%20high%2Dlevel%20week.">SDG Summit</a> was held in September, as was the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2023)751474">G20 summit</a> in New Delhi, followed in October by the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/meetings/splash/annual#:~:text=the%20full%20statement.-,Schedule,Global%20Action%2C%20Global%20Impact%E2%80%9D.">annual meetings</a> of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Marrakesh. In November, the UN adopted an <a href="https://taxjustice.net/press/un-adopts-plans-for-historic-tax-reform/#:~:text=22%20November%202023,-UN%20tax%20convention&amp;text=Countries%20at%20the%20UN%20have,global%20tax%20rules%20are%20decided.">important decision</a> on international tax cooperation. Now, leaders are meeting in Dubai for the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP28). </p><p data-line-id="f20bf4c37a164638baeb9c2d739fb0e5"> One obvious lesson from the meetings so far is that the world is taking far too long to achieve the SDGs – especially ending poverty and ensuring food security – and to make meaningful progress in the fight against climate change. Another is that the global economy is confronting policymakers with multiple risks: in 2022, a surge in inflation led to rapid interest-rate hikes in many countries, which, together with soaring public debt, limited governments’ ability to use expansionary fiscal policy to counter slowing growth. Although inflation is coming down, high interest rates and slower growth persist. </p><p data-line-id="bc60570edd274d4e862b6ca9f381e9bd"> Among the measures that have been proposed at and around this year’s meetings, three stand out. First, international development financing must be expanded significantly. Second, developing countries need more support to enable them to contribute to the provision of global public goods, particularly the fight against global pandemics and climate change, and manage the effects of international economic disruptions. Third, some form of relief must be provided to countries at high risk of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/dsa/dsalist.pdf">debt distress</a> – a group that includes at least one-third of developing economies. </p>

<p data-line-id="f71b798ca03e4ffe957f05352107f3b1"> SÃO PAULO/WAGENINGEN – This year has been the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/topping-charts-september-2023-was-earths-warmest-september-in-174-year-record#:~:text=September's%20temperature%20also%20helped%20propel,Chief%20Scientist%20Dr.%20Sarah%20Kapnick.">warmest on record</a>, with climate change causing more frequent and intense heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and droughts. The Amazon, home to more than <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chapter-2-Bound-May-9.pdf">10% of the world’s known biodiversity</a>, has not been spared. The return of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1af534b-52f4-4ef8-88e4-c54b3dcae8fc">El Niño</a>, a band of warm water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and record-breaking <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/record-breaking-north-atlantic-ocean-temperatures-contribute-extreme-marine-heatwaves">North Atlantic Ocean temperatures</a> have contributed to one of the most <a href="https://www.portodemanaus.com.br/?pagina=niveis-maximo-minimo-do-rio-negro">severe droughts</a> recorded in the region’s history, affecting at least <a href="https://www.unicef.org/documents/brazil-humanitarian-situation-report-no-1-amazon-drought-24-october-2023">600,000 people</a> and countless plants and animals. </p>
<p data-line-id="4cc15e479083417a98bd4716c15f1194"> At this critical moment, it is in the interest of all countries to view the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), currently underway in Dubai, as an opportunity to agree on the future of the world’s largest tropical rainforest. The Amazon plays a crucial role in shaping the global climate: it stores <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230803-SPA-Policy-Brief-EN_approved.pdf">150-200 billion tons</a> of carbon; cycles <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chapter-7-Bound-May-9.pdf">large amounts of water vapor</a> from the soil to the atmosphere, like a massive air conditioner; and <a href="https://rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/amazon_importance.htm">influences rainfall</a> across South America and beyond. Its conservation is fundamental to any realistic climate mitigation or adaptation agenda. </p>
<p data-line-id="bc296b00291b4538aa98f9dbfc6f6c1d"> Such an agenda is incompatible with business as usual. Deforestation, land degradation, and global warming are increasing tree-mortality rates, in turn reducing the capacity for <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-deforestation-affecting-global-water-cycles-climate-change">moisture recycling</a>, exacerbating wildfires, and diminishing forest resilience. This is pushing the region toward a catastrophic <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/221115-PB-tipping-point-en.pdf">tipping point</a>, which would result in a large-scale forest dieback, the release of between 110 and 275 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, a global temperature rise of 0.1-0.2° Celsius, and destabilization of other parts of the Earth system. If this tipping point were crossed, it would be almost impossible for the world to keep global warming below 1.5<sup>o</sup>C, the target set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. </p>
<p data-line-id="82509552913044e8b4a0019a8a7a4a3f"> Moreover, the belief that standing forests do not contribute to socioeconomic development has <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230811-PB-Bioeconomy-EN-approved2.pdf">exacerbated</a> <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chapter-18-Bound-May-11.pdf">non-environmental pressures</a> on the Amazon, including severe social inequality, conflicts over land rights, widespread poverty, illicit extractive activities, and weak governance institutions. These conditions have resulted in the destruction of ecosystems, chronic violence, and the displacement of indigenous peoples and local communities. Worse, the groups being displaced are among the most effective stewards of the Amazon, forming a <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PB-Indigenous-en.pdf">bulwark against climate change</a> that safeguards 10-20% of the global forest carbon stocks. </p>
<p data-line-id="d94b170e8b1441449a0bbf6d38c75d0e"> To protect and prevent the Amazon from reaching ecological and socioeconomic tipping points requires a paradigm shift at both the global and national levels. A <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/spa_publication/amazon-assessment-report-2021/">report</a> published by the <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/">Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA)</a>, a group of more than 250 scientists convened under the auspices of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, outlines what is needed. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0b85ff1df7844b8aab7b55e7bb1edea"> The report calls for conserving, restoring, and remediating terrestrial and aquatic systems; strengthening Amazonian governance by using participatory processes of engagement; and developing a <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230811-PB-Bioeconomy-EN-approved2.pdf">new </a><a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/230811-PB-Bioeconomy-EN-approved2.pdf">socio-bioeconomy</a> of healthy standing forests and flowing rivers. Only by reconciling economic and ecological security and prosperity with social justice can we create a new roadmap for socioeconomic development that <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/new-economy-brazil-amazon">improves</a> indigenous communities’ living standards while protecting the environment that sustains their existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="4163bbbbda5f45969f294f6a92c765b1"> Conserving the Amazon demands immediate action. While world leaders have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59088498">promised</a> to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, little progress has been made, beyond establishing intergovernmental <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leaders-launch-forests-and-climate-leaders-partnership-to-accelerate-momentum-to-halt-and-reverse-forest-loss-and-land-degradation-by-2030">partnerships</a> and making lofty promises. But the developed world <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/aggregate-trends-of-climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-in-2013-2020-d28f963c-en.htm">has yet to deliver</a> on its promise to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance to the Global South, and few countries have <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/11/cop27-what-was-achieved-and-what-needs-happen-now">followed through</a> on increasing their nationally determined contributions (emissions-reduction targets). </p>
<p data-line-id="55f594bb94e54cab9d8caa182cd8ce61"> At the regional level, this summer’s Amazon Summit ended with Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela <a href="http://otca.org/en/get-to-know-the-belem-declaration-signed-by-the-amazon-countries-at-the-summit/">declaring</a> their commitment to strengthening cooperation to protect the region’s forests and promote sustainable and inclusive development. But they <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/amazon-rainforest-nations-gather-forge-shared-policy-brazil-2023-08-08/">failed</a> to set a deadline for ending deforestation, illegal gold mining, and oil exploration in the Amazon. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a8ce669c52b472db920e761d3e48b8e"> All hope is not lost. Brazil, Peru, and Colombia have reported <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/?mainMap=eyJzaG93QW5hbHlzaXMiOnRydWV9&amp;map=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&amp;mapMenu=eyJtZW51U2VjdGlvbiI6ImRhdGFzZXRzIiwiZGF0YXNldENhdGVnb3J5IjoiZm9yZXN0Q2hhbmdlIiwic2VsZWN0ZWRDb3VudHJpZXMiOlsiUEVSIl19&amp;mapPrompts=eyJvcGVuIjp0cnVlLCJzdGVwc0tleSI6InJlY2VudEltYWdlcnkiLCJzdGVwc0luZGV4IjowfQ%3D%3D">declining deforestation rates in 2023</a>, and recent political developments <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230803-SPA-Policy-Brief-EN_approved.pdf">indicate</a> that there is growing momentum to conserve the Amazon. Moreover, Amazonian countries, indigenous people, and global supporters have high expectations for COP28. The <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/spa_publication/policy-brief-contribution-to-the-amazon-summit/">Amazon Summit</a> and the resulting <a href="https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/declaracao-presidencial-por-ocasiao-da-cupula-da-amazonia-2013-iv-reuniao-de-presidentes-dos-estados-partes-no-tratado-de-cooperacao-amazonica">Belém Declaration</a><a href="https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/declaracao-presidencial-por-ocasiao-da-cupula-da-amazonia-2013-iv-reuniao-de-presidentes-dos-estados-partes-no-tratado-de-cooperacao-amazonica"> </a>laid out what the region <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk8794">aims to achieve</a> at COP28 – goals that are closely linked with <a href="https://www.cop28.com/thematic-program">this year’s themes</a> – and how it can benefit from the annual summit. The SPA has also launched a series of <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/spa-reports/">policy briefs</a> for COP28 that synthesize the region’s key priorities and opportunities for action. </p>
<p data-line-id="8b1ce8e6aa8e47ceb626d7a4206cf558"> Chief among these goals is an immediate moratorium on deforestation and degradation in areas already approaching a tipping point, and an end to deforestation and degradation by 2030. This will help preserve the integrity of the Amazon’s biodiversity and ecosystems and ensure that it can continue to regulate the global climate. It will also be necessary to invest in and expand conservation and monitoring efforts, sustainable-forest management, <a href="https://www.theamazonwewant.org/spa_publication/transforming-the-amazon-through-arcs-of-restoration-policy-brief/">large-scale forest restoration</a>, and landscape remediation; to combat illicit activities; and to preserve indigenous land rights by bolstering collaborative efforts and enhancing public policies. </p>
<p data-line-id="766025e355114cb9b9ca6850d4b3f55e"> To secure a sustainable future, we must shift to a socio-bioeconomy based on healthy standing forests, flowing rivers, and empowered local communities. Such a model would recognize the importance of safeguarding frontline environmental defenders, and promoting inclusive decision-making processes. To achieve these goals, it will be crucial to mobilize financing, attract technology investments, and forge partnerships at COP28. </p>
<p data-line-id="8e58cb2c1d964b099a864d843d2cd6ea"> COP28 is a major opportunity to ensure the Amazon’s survival and well-being. But as the world’s largest forest, critical for climate regulation and global biodiversity, comes perilously close to environmental tipping points, we need to take drastic and immediate action. </p>

<p data-line-id="942d65fcf91d46adabde2d8b5cffbe46"> PRINCETON – Following the end of the recent weeklong ceasefire, Israel has resumed its war in Gaza, and dropped leaflets <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/israel-gaza-war-south-khan-younis/">urging</a> Palestinians to head toward the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. That has raised concerns that Israel is taking preliminary steps toward expelling Palestinians fully from the enclave, despite a stern American <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/politics/harris-cop28-israel-gaza/index.html">warning</a> not to do so. </p><p data-line-id="2a5435574cd74a8f9c8ebaf1ab18ce9c"> Whether it is intended or not, expulsion would have catastrophic consequences for regional security and stability. The United States and its Arab partners urgently need to step in to compel the Israeli leadership to halt the war and think more strategically. Perhaps the trauma of Hamas’s attack on October 7 has blinded Israeli leaders to the effects of their decisions. They should be reminded that Israel – along with the US and its other allies – have much to lose if the region descends into chaos and radicalization. </p><p data-line-id="df8467eaf67640419506f365e7232c23"> After all, an expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza would likely unravel the longstanding peace agreements between Israel and Egypt, and between Israel and Jordan. Those neighboring governments would be unable to withstand the public outcry and accusations of collusion with Israel. It would be the end of the US-led effort, launched by the late Henry Kissinger just after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, to create a Middle East security architecture and work toward regional peace.  </p>

<p data-line-id="6bef306b276646df8bc23e8536fb52db"> CHICAGO – Americans have worried about their presidents becoming dictators (or, in the old days, tyrants) ever since the Unites States was founded. The framers of the US Constitution understood that in classical democracies and republics, leaders often tried to seize power from legislatures and other assemblies. That is why they created a system of checks and balances on government power. </p><p data-line-id="c72a417348d5430c930273605f0eec3b"> So far, so good. No US president has ever been a dictator. Nonetheless, accusing the other side’s candidate of seeking dictatorial powers has become a quadrennial ritual, one that has started early this time around. In a widely circulated <em>Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/30/trump-dictator-2024-election-robert-kagan/">commentary</a> last week, Robert Kagan, repeating his <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/this-is-how-fascism-comes-to-america/">earlier prediction</a> that former President Donald Trump would become a fascist leader, warned that he would become a dictator if he is elected again in 2024. Kagan likens a Trump victory to an asteroid crashing into the earth, echoing the widely ridiculed <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/">commentary</a> by Michael Anton, who likened a Hillary Clinton victory in 2016 to a suicide attack on an airliner. </p><p data-line-id="bc5fed3ba0bb420999279e5ef4a72c04"> Trump was and is many things, most of them bad. But he wasn’t a fascist when he was president, and he won’t be a dictator if he is elected a second time. Far from a strongman, Trump was weak throughout his previous term. His main accomplishments – a tax cut, a stimulus package during the pandemic, and appointments of conservative (but largely mainstream) judges – all went through normal constitutional procedures, with Congress fully involved. Meanwhile, Congress thwarted Trump’s promises to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/senate-rejects-repealing-obamacare-without-replacement-trump.html">repeal</a> the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/us/politics/senate-vote-trump-national-emergency.html#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20A%20dozen%20Republicans%20joined,border%20wall%20over%20Congress's%20objections.">build</a> a wall on the border with Mexico. </p>

<p data-line-id="613e9192bd1349419aede12f2e48b401"> WASHINGTON, DC – This week, representatives of donor and borrower countries have been meeting in Zanzibar, Tanzania, to review the current funding cycle of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s concessional lending arm. They are taking stock of the IDA’s ongoing programs and the needs of the world’s poorest people. But the choice of venue is significant, because it enables participants to witness the extraordinary impact of IDA funding, while reflecting Africa’s central role in development, now and in the future. </p><p data-line-id="9c8ff17375bc4f798815baa690558ba4"> By 2050, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/20/by-2050-a-quarter-of-the-worlds-people-will-be-african-this-will-shape-our-future">one in four people</a> on the planet will be African, and the continent will have the world’s largest and youngest workforce, as well as vast consumer markets. Currently, however, African countries – many of which are fragile and conflict-ridden – are among the world’s poorest. Around <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/overview">462 million</a> people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) live in extreme poverty, while many governments are grappling with catastrophic weather, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and high levels of debt and unemployment. </p><p data-line-id="7a1437e6e66049d9aa0e1b769e7356d0"> To realize Africa’s tremendous potential, governments must focus on increasing employment opportunities. Currently, only <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/africa-pulse">one in six workers</a> in SSA has a salaried job, compared to one in two in high-income countries. In the absence of a stable income, many Africans cannot thrive or plan for the future. Creating new and better jobs for young people would drive inclusive growth and turn the continent’s demographic wealth into an economic dividend. </p>

<p data-line-id="7d9311d33eb9481e82ffdd33586a8c3a"> WASHINGTON, DC – The largest antitrust trial of the modern internet era, which wrapped up last month, has pitted the world’s most popular search engine, Google, against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/google-trial-big-tech-lobbying-shows-why-antitrust-enforcement-needed-by-eric-posner-2023-11?barrier=accesspaylog">case</a> hearkens back to the DOJ’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/business/google-antitrust-microsoft-precedent.html">landmark lawsuit</a> against Microsoft in the 1990s, but with a critical difference: most of it was held behind closed doors. This unprecedented secrecy meant that only journalists and observers who were <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/law-geeks-exposing-google-secretive-antitrust-trial/">physically in the courtroom</a> had access – albeit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/29/google-antitrust-trial-limited-public-access">limited</a> – to the proceedings. </p><p data-line-id="c5d5b5d8dd814b9d91c317ab78947b0d"> Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-approach/">stated mission</a> is to make the world’s information universally accessible. But Google’s actions during the trial, in which it was accused of illegally maintaining a search and advertising monopoly, stand in sharp contrast to that credo. They also set a dangerous precedent: a private company, in an effort to protect its core business and reputation, persuaded a court to limit transparency and public access to information, eroding press freedom and constraining news coverage of the trial in the US and abroad. </p><p data-line-id="9c421d06e15f45a5944db865c6860da1"> From the start, Google went to great lengths to keep as much information as possible away from the public. The company successfully <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1699194522385760399">objected</a> to the court providing a live audio feed of the proceedings and managed to convince the judge to <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2023-09-07-google-protect-monopoly-cover-of-darkness/">sequester key witnesses’ testimony</a>, arguing that trade secrets could be revealed in open court. As the trial wound down, Google also challenged the DOJ’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/case/us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc">posting of evidence</a> on its website, which led to the material’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-21/google-googl-emails-memos-hidden-from-web-as-doj-caves-to-pressure?sref=ZvMMMOkz">removal</a> for a full week. <em>The New York Times</em>, with the support of other publications, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.731.1_1.pdf">filed a motion</a> demanding that the court give reporters <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2023-11-28-google-secret-trial/">access to admitted trial exhibits</a>. </p>

<p data-line-id="7490f615880c4c00ac70ac2fd2d130af"> PARIS – In recent years, many policymakers thought they had found the perfect formula for implementing climate-friendly policies without facing difficult political tradeoffs: massive subsidies. This strategy, often associated with US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)<em>,</em> has influenced several Western countries. </p><p data-line-id="20faf836c18e40989c76cdad9cc44eee"> Historically, mainstream economists believed that the best way to facilitate a green transition was to establish a carbon price through taxation or quotas and then leave the relevant economic decisions to private actors. Unsurprisingly, many economists have criticized the IRA as a less efficient method of allocating resources. But they missed important aspects of policies based on green industrial subsidies. </p><p data-line-id="6bd245354a6441d7bd0eeeded7cd0861"> Such policies managed to overcome some of the political obstacles that have hindered climate policymaking. They raised hopes that industrial interests, security concerns, and environmental priorities could be aligned. They balance voters’ deep concerns about climate change and workers’ demands for reindustrialization, and even serve some purely economic objectives. </p>

But the fossil-fuel industry is doubling down with investments in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/3/oil-giants-invest-in-exploration-as-profits-trump-climate">new oil and gas projects</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-11/exxon-s-historic-shale-deal-signals-new-wave-of-oil-mergers">major corporate mergers</a>, <a href="https://grist.org/economics/bp-exxon-shell-backing-off-climate-promises/">walking back</a> climate pledges, and making <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/oil-majors-carbon-capture-plans-dubbed-a-dangerous-delusion?embedded-checkout=true">false promises</a> that they can <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/oil-companies-want-to-remove-carbon-from-the-air-using-taxpayer-dollars/">keep pumping</a> without polluting. We need to ditch fossil fuels. But how? </p>
<p data-line-id="757afab1689b41c393c9375d491f30d9"> The answer is unlikely to emerge from this year’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/25/cop28-uae-oil-climate-sultan-al-jaber/">petrostate-hosted</a> United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, which could deliver a political commitment to phase out fossil fuels but won’t chart the pathway to a fossil-free future. To address what UN Secretary-General <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a> has called “<a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-encounter/2023-11-20/secretary-generals-press-conference-unep-emissions-gap-report-launch">the poisoned root of the climate crisis</a>,” we must look beyond the <a href="https://unfccc.int/">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) to forge new forums fit for this purpose. </p>
<p data-line-id="fd634f76e7e74718a3ceb06d9c0e6a9a"> The good news is that Guterres, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/enough-with-fossil-fuels-pope-says-latest-climate-appeal-2023-05-25/">pope</a>, numerous <a href="https://unclimatesummit.org/17-high-ambition-coalition-world-leaders-call-for-faster-stronger-climate-action/">national governments</a>, and bodies like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/12/beginning-of-the-end-of-fossil-fuel-era-approaching-says-iea">International Energy Agency</a> have joined the <a href="https://fightfossilfuels.net/">growing global </a><a href="https://fightfossilfuels.net/">call</a> for a phaseout of coal, oil, and gas. At the UN <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-ambition-summit">Climate Ambition Summit</a> in September, governments <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/fossil-fuel-companies-climate-change-political-leaders-1.6977578">acknowledged</a> that the climate crisis is a fossil-fuel crisis. The question is not whether to move beyond oil and gas, but how. </p>
<p data-line-id="e549130f056042688ce4baca39b50b6e"> The bad news is that the fossil-fuel industry, buoyed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/big-oil-rakes-in-record-annual-profit-fueling-calls-for-higher-taxes.html">record-breaking profits</a> in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, seems impervious to such pressure. Worse, these colossal profits are being <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/oil-giants-drill-deep-profits-trump-climate-concerns-2023-07-03/#:~:text=The%20International%20Energy%20Agency%20forecasts,reach%20a%2010%2Dyear%20high.">reinvested</a> in <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/worlds-biggest-fossil-fuel-firms-projected-to-spend-almost-a-trillion-dollars-on-new-oil-and-gas-fields-by-2030/">more oil and gas</a> development. As climate disasters intensify before our eyes, the industry responsible for <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change">nearly 90%</a> of carbon dioxide emissions is betting that its dirty products will be a mainstay of the global economy for decades to come. </p>
<p data-line-id="d3c18586b6af44738c94dcba81a41d77"> To force a change, we must expose the economic fragility that fossil-fuel dependence creates and its broader toll on <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/7382/2023/en/">human rights</a>. Reliance on oil, gas, and coal makes communities more vulnerable to supply <a href="https://news.un.org/pages/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GCRG_3rd-Brief_Aug3_2022_FINAL.pdf">disruptions</a>, affecting everything from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01209-8">heating and transportation</a> to <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-the-energy-crisis-is-exacerbating-the-food-crisis">food prices</a>. Such disruptions <a href="https://www.undp.org/energy/blog/three-trends-will-shape-energy-sector-2023">fall hardest</a> on the most impoverished populations while boosting the industry’s profits. </p>
<p data-line-id="19d9ff64842941ea9180c0c89f1df612"> It is worth recalling that fossil-fuel companies <a href="https://ieefa.org/financial-case-fossil-fuel-divestment#:~:text=Fossil%20fuel%20companies%20have%20underperformed,of%202.0%25%20of%20the%20index.">underperformed</a> the market for the ten years preceding the war in Ukraine. That decade of decline reflected long-term energy-transition trends that the recent uptick in earnings has not changed. With fossil-fuel demand projected to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/world-oil-gas-coal-demand-peak-by-2030-iea-says-2023-10-24/">peak</a> globally by 2030, oil and gas remain a bad bet. </p>
<p data-line-id="719c3a060a9f41a2bff74e41e6a7225e"> Part of the problem is that governments have responded to price volatility by <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-surged-to-record-7-trillion">increasing</a> fossil-fuel subsidies, rather than imposing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/bp-profits-energy-windfall-tax-oil-gas">windfall taxes</a>. They also have continued to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/climate/oil-gas-drilling-investment-worldwide-willow.html">approve</a> new oil and gas projects, including offshore in <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2023/11/20/more-than-a-quarter-of-newly-approved-oil-and-gas-blocks-fall-in-marine-protected-areas/">protected ocean areas</a>. Planned production is <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/governments-plan-produce-double-fossil-fuels-2030-15degc-warming">double</a> what’s compatible with the target of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels; there is simply <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach/executive-summary">no room</a> for new oil and gas supply if the world is to avoid climate catastrophe. </p>
<p data-line-id="b5d78fba77554c888dae2648d7c824ad"> Fossil fuels appear competitive with <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2023/Aug/Renewables-Competitiveness-Accelerates-Despite-Cost-Inflation#:~:text=Global%20power%20sector%20saved%20fuel,the%20competitiveness%20of%20renewable%20power.">ever-cheaper renewables</a> only because their production has been subsidized and their producers insulated from the costs associated with the <a href="https://climateanalytics.org/publications/carbon-majors-trillion-dollar-damages#:~:text=Between%201985%20and%202018%2C%20we,larger%20%2D%20roughly%2030%20trillion%20USD.">damage</a> they cause. The industry’s negative externalities, long borne by frontline communities, are now being imposed on people around the world in the form of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/climate/hawaii-fires-climate-change.html">wildfires</a>, <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/hurricane-otis-causes-catastrophic-damage-acapulco-mexico">hurricanes</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-libya-flood-study-3eda9e77840d8bbd7058e494cc0a2231">floods</a>, and <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-africas-extreme-weather-have-killed-at-least-15000-people-in-2023/#:~:text=Drought%20and%20famine,-Numerous%20African%20countries&amp;text=According%20to%20Carbon%20Brief%20analysis,Niger%20and%20Somalia%20in%202023.">droughts</a>. If we compelled fossil-fuel companies to shoulder the losses they <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/01/harvard-led-analysis-finds-exxonmobil-internal-research-accurately-predicted-climate-change/">long saw coming</a>, and redirected public funds to renewable solutions, oil and gas assets would be exposed as the liabilities they are. </p>
<p data-line-id="73da9a537ce94936b7e8290965c77f96"> This points to another big problem: corporate capture. Although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/business/california-oil-lawsuit-newsom.html">climate litigation</a> is key to holding the industry accountable, the challenge is not just to make polluters pay for the harms they cause. We also must diminish their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/climate/al-gore-fossil-fuel.html">outsize influence</a> on climate policy. Despite the best efforts of movements like <a href="https://kickbigpollutersout.org/">Kick Big Polluters Out</a>, the fossil-fuel industry not only has a seat at this year’s climate talks; it is at the head of the table. </p>
<p data-line-id="391ecc547e2e4e6ba63dac89eccdea2d"> There sits <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sultan-al-jaber">Sultan Al Jaber</a>, the CEO of the United Arab Emirates’ national oil company, which is currently pursuing its own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/15/cop28-host-uae-oil-plans-data">expansion plans</a>. Al Jaber, COP28 president, is intent on portraying the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/climate/sultan-al-jaber-uae-cop28.html">fossil-fuel industry as the hero</a>, not the villain, in the fight against climate change. Yet this is a well-known survival strategy for an industry in long-term decline. So, too, is the UAE’s advocacy of an “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/climate/uae-cop28-documents-al-jaber.html">all of the above</a>” approach that promotes renewables as a complement to fossil fuels, rather than a replacement for them, and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/16/cop28-host-uae-climate-united-arab-emirates">champions</a> <a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/carbon-capture-has-long-history-failure">carbon capture</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/19/do-carbon-credit-reduce-emissions-greenhouse-gases">offsets</a>, despite abundant evidence that neither leads to significant emissions reductions. </p>
<p data-line-id="c469a2aa706046849f26de257b88e751"> Contrary to what Al Jaber <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/05/02/cop28-head-backs-fossil-phase-out-with-carbon-capture-caveat/">suggested</a> earlier this year, the problem is not just with fossil-fuel emissions; it is with fossil fuels themselves. Focusing only on carbon ignores all the <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2023/11/beyond-climate-oil-gas-and-coal-are-destabilizing-all-9-planetary-boundaries/">other negative effects</a> of fossil fuels, including their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/climate/fossil-fuels-uae-health-cop28.html#:~:text=Fuels'%20Pits%20U.A.E.-,Against%20Public%20Health%20Experts,lack%20two%20words%3A%20fossil%20fuels.&amp;text=Climate%20Forward%20There's%20an%20ongoing%20crisis%20%E2%80%94%20and%20tons%20of%20news.">impact on health</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/">eight million premature deaths</a> from air pollution annually. </p>
<p data-line-id="5913391054d840b7b111c618e408f21c"> Though fossil fuels are overwhelmingly to blame for climate change, our UNFCCC-led climate regime has failed to address them, even before the industry was handed the gavel. For decades, the international body that should be leading the fossil-fuel phaseout has conspicuously avoided the issue. Neither the 1992 UN Climate Convention nor the 2015 Paris climate agreement <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/10/fossil-fuels-mention-cop-draft-paris/">mentions</a> oil, gas, or coal. </p>
<p data-line-id="c3e0a0b866d04b239ea1349ea6594fc6"> This omission was not some casual oversight. It is a symptom of a deeper crisis in global climate governance. Because UNFCCC decisions require a <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/12/01/world/cop28-outcome-predictable/">consensus</a> among 198 members, powerful countries can block progress and assure lowest-common-denominator outcomes, or none at all. </p>
<p data-line-id="744f4a240441493d9874a738af5f1178"> COP28 further underscores the need for alternative processes to manage the decline of fossil fuels, free from the influence of those who profit from them. Every day provides new reminders of why we need to phase out oil, gas, and coal. Fortunately, initiatives like the <a href="https://fossilfueltreaty.org/">Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>, the <a href="https://beyondoilandgasalliance.org/">Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fossilfuelinquiry.org/">Global Parliamentarians’ Inquiry</a> offer new ideas about how to do it. Governments must commit to a forum dedicated to fossil-fuel phaseout so the real work of ending the fossil-fuel era can begin. </p>

<p data-line-id="3d19aebc74fb437ea677b3fb7932894d"> ABU DHABI/SALVADOR – Climate change affects every aspect of our lives, from the food we produce and our health to global peace and security. But the climate crisis is transforming not only our natural ecosystems but also our social and cultural landscapes, eroding our tangible and intangible heritage and practices, and depriving us of precious sources of resilience, meaning, identity, and knowledge. </p><p data-line-id="2102d119981c4cd7849e78c8687cff6c"> In short, the climate crisis is rapidly becoming a cultural emergency. Climate change is already damaging important sites around the world, with UNESCO reporting that <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/climate-change/culture">nearly one-third</a> of its 318 World Heritage cities are located in vulnerable coastal areas. These historic locations, which have long linked countries and communities to their cultural identities, now face gradual erosion and are in danger of being lost forever. </p><p data-line-id="cbcde3d896c046378a953dea9abc9c7f"> Moreover, climate change poses a clear and immediate threat to communities’ unique ways of life. Oral traditions, performing arts, festive events, and traditional knowledge, all of which have developed gradually over many generations, are vulnerable to the ravages of the climate crisis. </p>

<p data-line-id="979b2894764c49d2980d825387f2818e"> MADRID/BOSTON – This year’s <a href="https://www.cop28.com/">United Nations Climate Change Conference</a> (COP28), currently underway in Dubai, will be decisive for the Loss and Damage Fund established at COP27, because governments must agree on how the new fund will be operationalized and financed. But equally important is the first <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">global stocktake</a> (GST), which will assess countries’ progress toward achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. </p>
<p data-line-id="db3a86700fb543fd9f22294033f25acd"> A <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/SYR_Views%20on%20%20Elements%20for%20CoO.pdf">preliminary report</a> on the GST, released in October, is underwhelming, while the most recent <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023">World Energy Outlook</a> from the International Energy Agency found that global carbon dioxide levels have <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023/secure-and-people-centred-energy-transitions#abstract">yet to peak</a>. This implies that if we want to achieve our climate targets, we must fast-track the clean-energy transition and urgently slash greenhouse-gas emissions. But while this will undoubtedly require closing the massive <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/finance-for-climate-action-scaling-up-investment-for-climate-and-development/">climate financing gap</a>, policymakers must overcome widespread sovereign-debt distress. </p>
<p data-line-id="5b5fdc48a1c64db8a550906d5b825924"> The <a href="https://drgr.org/">Debt Relief for a Green and Inclusive Recovery Project</a>, using data from the UN Development Programme and the International Monetary Fund, <a href="https://drgr.org/news/frequently-asked-questions-debt-relief-for-a-green-and-inclusive-recovery/">estimates</a> that 69 countries need immediate debt relief, of which 61 have at least <a href="https://drgr.org/our-proposal/report-guaranteeing-sustainable-development/">$812 billion</a> in debt that must be restructured across all creditor classes. Moreover, an IMF working paper <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/08/11/Debt-for-Climate-Swaps-Analysis-Design-and-Implementation-522184">calculated</a> that only seven of 29 low-income countries that submitted estimates of their adaptation needs had sufficient fiscal space to meet those needs and achieve their emissions-reduction targets, also known as <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs). With debt-service costs set to <a href="https://drgr.org/our-proposal/report-guaranteeing-sustainable-development/">increase</a> in 2024, many countries will <a href="https://unctad.org/news/un-warns-soaring-global-public-debt-record-92-trillion-2022">spend more</a> on interest payments than on health or education. </p>
<p data-line-id="35e15b12bc2f45118a55733475c1f3d1"> As long as the debt crisis in the Global South grinds on, many emerging-market and developing economies will be unable to invest in gender-sensitive low-carbon development. This, in turn, would make these countries more vulnerable to climate shocks and fiscal instability, and would also foreclose the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius, the target set by the Paris climate agreement. </p>
<p data-line-id="bc3c386f1c7e4caaa1f0129d8e8519e6"> To address the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/debt-crisis-climate-change-developing-countries-g20-cop27-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2022-12">debt-climate nexus</a> at COP28 and beyond, policymakers should focus on three objectives: a more inclusive and efficient debt-restructuring process; more concessional finance; and expansion of the size and remit of multilateral development banks (MDBs). </p>
<p data-line-id="aa2cbc857c9f47bab5abbb7ed61cc7d1"> For starters, the G20’s Common Framework must be reformed to ensure that all climate-vulnerable countries, including middle-income countries, are eligible for debt treatment. While the Common Framework has started <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zambia-announces-debt-restructuring-agreement-with-bondholders-2023-10-26/">providing relief</a>, recent debt-restructuring deals have been modest in scope and came at the cost of protracted negotiations that only exacerbated the problem. Future deals must ensure significant relief measures that enable countries to kickstart economic growth and achieve climate goals, rather than merely returning them to previous levels of austerity or helping them stave off the next crisis. </p>
<p data-line-id="f35c13d9d4654345a2b3f79c7c84ebba"> Second, the need for more concessional finance has never been clearer. In October, at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Marrakesh, IMF Managing Director <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/kristalina-georgieva">Kristalina Georgieva</a> noted that interest rates were in a “<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/13/sp101323-md-am-plenary-speech">higher-for-longer era</a>.” This comes at the same time that countries must accelerate the deployment of renewables, which are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/00e8af58-f2b4-4d91-9c6e-bd2045c22c20">highly</a> <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230110~21c89bef1b.en.html">sensitive</a> to the cost of capital. Moreover, climate vulnerability has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20302588">found</a> to drive up the cost of debt and restrict access to financing. </p>
<p data-line-id="3aae740c0e1a41fa832ebe21054dd444"> But there is ample room to scale up concessional finance. From 2021 to 2022, low-cost project-level debt and grants accounted for only <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2023.pdf">11%</a> of total climate finance, according to the Climate Policy Initiative. The World Bank, as part of its “Evolution Roadmap” initiative, has <a href="https://www.devcommittee.org/content/dam/sites/devcommittee/doc/documents/2023/Final%20Updated%20Evolution%20Paper%20DC2023-0003.pdf">indicated</a> that it will expand concessional lending beyond the poorest countries to fund necessary climate investments. Other MDBs should emulate this approach, and their shareholders should inject more capital to facilitate it, so that governments can access affordable financing that does not crowd out other priorities. </p>
<p data-line-id="79af113a90364e48bc40fcc01077ef2c"> Moreover, MDBs must become bigger and better-equipped to supply the low-cost, long-term finance that climate-vulnerable countries need. While the World Bank has taken a step in this direction by <a href="https://www.devcommittee.org/content/dam/sites/devcommittee/doc/documents/2023/Final%20Updated%20Evolution%20Paper%20DC2023-0003.pdf">implementing</a> balance-sheet-optimization measures to increase the scale of its lending by $50 billion over the next ten years, it is not enough. Other MDBs should devise concrete plans for capital increases and, when presenting it to their boards, outline how a fresh injection of funds will enable them to provide low-cost finance to developing countries and make bolder bets on transformational investments. </p>
<p data-line-id="d336e45d666c462587be75967ac28b95"> In addition to increasing their lending capacity, MDBs must reform the debt architecture. For example, the World Bank has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/factsheet/2023/12/01/world-bank-extends-new-lifeline-for-countries-hit-by-natural-disasters">advanced</a> a debt-pause clause in new and existing lending agreements that permits 45 small islands and states facing qualifying events to postpone their interest and principal payments. But loans of all borrowing countries should include such a clause. It would also be in the interest of MDB shareholders to improve the debt-restructuring process: an extended debt crisis simply means that MDBs will need to provide concessional finance for a longer period, given that it is tied to debt indicators. </p>
<p data-line-id="99b3c6986a504a369f81af30f7d08ea8"> The GST at COP28 is sure to find that the world is falling <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/global-stocktake-moves-closer-to-a-conclusion-at-cop28">far short</a> of the Paris agreement’s targets. Accelerated action – across climate finance, global policy coordination, and renewable-energy deployment – is needed, but high levels of debt stand in the way. Tellingly, Egypt, the host of last year’s COP, explicitly <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-07/Egypt%20Updated%20NDC.pdf.pdf">noted</a> in its revised NDC that debt-service payments were limiting the country’s climate ambition. </p>
<p data-line-id="300c6e982624420491b2a961328afe33"> G20 governments and international financial institutions must acknowledge that a severe debt overhang could worsen the climate crisis. Mobilizing financial resources on an unprecedented scale, while important, should be complemented by measures to address heavy sovereign-debt burdens. One hopes that by forcing policymakers to confront the world’s dangerously slow progress toward net-zero emissions at COP28, the GST will generate the political will and trust necessary to tackle the interlocking problems of debt distress and global warming. </p>

<p data-line-id="5ccfd7c8121149da9bd6300195168a5e"> NEW YORK – Even with the recent partial retreat in long-term real and nominal interest rates, they remain well above the ultra-low levels to which policymakers had grown accustomed, and they are likely to stay at such levels even as inflation retreats. It is now past time to revisit the widely prevailing “free lunch” view of government debt. </p><p data-line-id="f6ec2ab010634bbe83e3ab39d52fd80e"> The idea that interest rates would be low forever seemed to support the view that any concern about debt was an endorsement of “austerity.” Many came to believe that governments should run large deficits during recessions and only slightly smaller deficits in normal times. No one seemed concerned with the possible risks, in particular to inflation and interest rates. The left championed the notion that government debt could be used to expand social programs, going beyond what could be generated by reducing military spending, while those on the right seemed to believe that taxes exist only to be cut. </p><p data-line-id="0291fc1e962a418daa2d6ad11d745afc"> The most misguided approach involved using central banks to purchase government debt, which appeared costless when short-term interest rates were zero. This idea is at the core of Modern Monetary Theory and “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/helicopter-money-coronavirus-response-by-willem-h-buiter-1-2020-03">helicopter money</a>.” In recent years, even prominent macroeconomists have floated the idea of having the US Federal Reserve write off government debt after soaking it up through quantitative easing, a seemingly simple solution to any potential sovereign-debt problem. </p>

<p data-line-id="8dbabcf453914301ab7e4d6a9498ae7a"> NEW DELHI – The United States has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/nyregion/sikh-assassination-plot-charges-india.html">charged</a> Indian national Nikhil Gupta, a 52-year-old narcotics and weapons trader, for plotting to murder a prominent Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US citizen, in New York City. The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/did-india-order-the-murder-of-a-us-sikh-separatist-heres-what-we-know#:~:text=The%20indictment%20alleges%20that%20CC,to%20be%20a%20criminal%20associate.">indictment</a>, which alleges that an Indian government official in New Delhi paid Gupta to arrange the killing, has cast a shadow over India’s relationship with the US as well as the country’s global image. </p><p data-line-id="60e8bcdd167540a88f624d54d2122874"> We have been here before. Just a couple of months ago, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-read-statements-from-the-prime-minister-and-opposition-leaders-on/">claimed</a> that there were “credible allegations” about a “potential link” between India’s government and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/19/who-is-hardeep-singh-nijjar-sikh-canada-killed/">fatal shooting</a> in June of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, on Canadian soil. India responded with outrage, demanding the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/10/canada-removes-41-diplomats-from-india-after-new-delhi-threatens-to-revoke-their-immunity/">withdrawal</a> of 41 Canadian diplomats from New Delhi. </p><p data-line-id="21c3c895383d47a68e6bb4cc90c7581e"> But whereas Trudeau could not prove that the Indian government was involved in Nijjar’s killing, the US Justice Department is prepared to take its evidence to court. Among the damning details is one that seems to link the two killings: Gupta’s handler in New Delhi allegedly sent him a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/us-indictment-india-assassination-attempt-sikh-activist">video clip</a> “showing Nijjar’s bloody body slumped in his vehicle,” which Gupta carelessly shared with the hitman he had hired. </p>

<p data-line-id="b975477f7b364f3ca66e6dc372cb7493"> LONDON – Irish author Paul Lynch has been awarded this year’s Booker Prize, one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the English-speaking world, for his novel <a href="https://oneworld-publications.com/work/prophet-song/"><em>Prophet Song</em></a><em> – </em>and for good reason. With its harrowing vision of Ireland descending into tyranny, Lynch’s book perfectly captures the anxiety that characterizes our current political moment. </p><p data-line-id="b863773f44ab458db198b67774d5f107"> Not all critics were impressed. One reviewer described it as a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/booker-prize-2023-winner-paul-lynch-prophet-song-6s8pthl3d">flapping turkey</a>” of a book, criticizing Lynch for his sub-Orwellian themes and prose. But most reviews have been more favorable, with many lauding the book for reflecting mounting concerns about the future of parliamentary democracy in Western Europe and beyond. Lynch’s portrayal of a country sliding into authoritarian rule would certainly resonate with far-right leaders such as the recently triumphant Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and France’s Marine Le Pen. </p><p data-line-id="de3e1fae32634d1585760d25c7e09c00"> Wilders’ stunning <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/geert-wilders-outsider-nationalism-by-ian-buruma-2023-11">victory</a> in the Dutch general election underscores the growing support for far-right parties across Europe. For more than two decades, he has been a vocal critic of the Netherlands’ immigration policies, frequently targeting the country’s Muslim community. His rise to prominence can be largely attributed to the blend of identity politics and simplistic solutions characteristic of today’s populist movements. </p>

<p data-line-id="0307ff840aca4936a12ecd6b4d7e58c5"> NAIROBI – Efforts to build the nascent green-hydrogen industry in Africa are underway, most notably in Namibia’s Tsau Khaeb National Park. In May, the Namibian government <a href="https://www.slrconsulting.com/public-documents/hyphen-project/">signed</a> a feasibility and implementation agreement with Hyphen Hydrogen Energy for a green-hydrogen production and supply project close to the coastal town of Lüderitz. In June, the government <a href="https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/namibia-agrees-to-take-up-24-stake-in-10bn-green-hydrogen-project-2023-06-21">agreed</a> to take a 24% equity stake in the $10 billion project, whose value is nearly equal to Namibia’s GDP. </p>
<p data-line-id="a286448952ce454e989a5e8a1089a5af"> Once fully operational, the project is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/dutch-firms-partner-namibia-to-create-sovereign-wealth-fund">expected</a> to produce 350,000 metric tons of green hydrogen per year and <a href="https://hyphenafrica.com/projects/">create</a> 3,000 permanent jobs (in addition to 15,000 temporary construction jobs). It could position Namibia as a major producer of low-cost green hydrogen. But important questions remain about the project’s local value addition and how to avoid the creation of another extractive industry. </p>
<p data-line-id="b5f3185983574264ad894d4180e5057d"> For decades, African countries have invested billions of dollars in fossil-fuel energy systems, and yet <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings">600 million</a> people on the continent remain without access to electricity. Even as global warming destroys ecosystems, undermines food security, and worsens water scarcity, Africa still <a href="https://ecdpm.org/application/files/2416/7422/1814/Scaling-up-African-clean-energy-Discussion-Paper-334-ECDPM-2023.pdf">relies heavily</a> on fossil fuels; renewables account for only about <a href="https://ca1-clm.edcdn.com/assets/renewable_energy_transition_in_sub-saharan_africa.pdf">21%</a> of electricity generation. But the rapidly escalating climate crisis implies an urgent need to reorient the continent’s energy system away from oil and gas. </p>
<p data-line-id="a065c80dd28c4022871432869859378d"> A rapid rollout of renewable energy could be transformative, helping Africa meet the twin challenges of climate change and underdevelopment. But to ensure electricity access for all, such systems must be environmentally sound and socially inclusive. Ironically, the continent’s limited energy infrastructure means that African countries can leapfrog past fossil fuels (thus avoiding stranded assets as the world shifts to renewable energy) and build a green economy that is based on renewables and designed to meet their needs. </p>
<p data-line-id="d00ac79330cc4a3a8687108e11a881c0"> Low-cost green hydrogen can expand energy access on the continent and accelerate the shift toward renewables. And by creating local value chains, generating green jobs, and transferring technology and knowledge, it could also contribute enormously to the development of producer countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="99fc8df879e74703b4b5e57be6e2f2fc"> But, to reap these benefits, the development of green hydrogen in Africa must primarily serve African interests. That means the processes and policies for generating and using green hydrogen must comply with the standards set out in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, the ambitious global targets introduced by the United Nations in 2015. They must also meet the objectives of the Paris climate agreement and the African Union’s <a href="https://au.int/en/agenda2063/overview">Agenda 2063</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="2cf1dcf46f284782adee8eda7055c597"> Such projects must also maintain ecosystem integrity, promote decent work and economic prosperity, boost social inclusion and cohesion, and respect human rights. Crucially, these objectives can be met only by gaining broad public acceptance: the free, prior, and informed consent and participation of potentially affected communities. </p>
<p data-line-id="a22d61cc945c4d2b98c2b68b9bbd7b01"> Good governance and transparency in developing green hydrogen could change power relations between the developed world and African countries. Instead of falling into the trap of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/23/un-indigenous-peoples-forum-climate-strategy-warning">green colonialism</a>,” these countries could build equal partnerships that address head-on issues of equity and ownership, inclusion, resource competition, and displacement. </p>
<p data-line-id="4ee70d3a8f354068a7d45a1ebb25c989"> To be sure, green-hydrogen projects pose significant risks. Chief among these are land-use conflicts, forced resettlement, expropriation, and other potential human-rights violations. There are also environmental concerns, including the fact that production requires large amounts of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01375">freshwater</a>. Given that <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-taking-bottom-approach-water-management?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab20002dbb93cc7650e9bc237f34e6d45ae0899dcb025f43755a2f24eda031ac87da2908e7b0fac114300075cf91fb9e559720c3e9f61ef6249cc7965bc480aa48ad63452a253827eccb18ed4364dd4381c8c913d6f228380eea97">one in three Africans</a> faces water scarcity, developing this energy source could compound the problem, and may even cause or exacerbate conflicts, especially in Africa’s driest regions. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f65f0bea25e400dbba3c297919fe58c"> Moreover, large-scale plants, as well as export infrastructure, could damage fragile ecosystems, destroy protected areas, and endanger marine life. This is especially true if desalinated seawater is used in hydrogen production, and the resulting brine is released, untreated, into local bodies of water. </p>
<p data-line-id="50262c07663f4255b7fedaad7a42cea7"> But the biggest concern is that green hydrogen produced in Africa could be exported elsewhere. This would defeat the purpose of developing renewable-energy capacity on the continent. Instead of expanding electricity access and boosting climate resilience, this new industry would merely be the latest in a long line of energy injustices. Moreover, it would be wasteful: converting hydrogen into derivatives like ammonia – which are more suitable for transport – can result in <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Nov/IRENA_Green_hydrogen_policy_2020.pdf">13-25% energy loss</a>, while transportation itself requires high energy inputs. </p>
<p data-line-id="b05a2af55ff048ba89e917a125087b1e"> Green hydrogen can fuel economic growth and prosperity for producer countries. But to realize the potential of a hydrogen-powered economy, African leaders must ensure that the industry is structured to achieve a just energy transition on the continent and serve the needs of local communities, not foreign interests. </p>

<p data-line-id="457baf0b92ac47e7825b916ea61e3fa6"> MILAN – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) has begun in Dubai. Depending on whom you ask, the outlook ranges from deeply pessimistic to cautiously optimistic. But there is one thing on which almost everyone agrees: effective climate action is more urgent than ever. </p><p data-line-id="b1f1c14ecd824466a34733f42483c689"> This shared sense of urgency at COP28 is crucial. Some <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/un-climate-change-conference-united-arab-emirates-nov/dec-2023/about-cop-28">70,000 delegates</a> – including representatives of all parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and a range of other stakeholders, from business leaders to climate scientists – are expected to participate. Such a vast and varied group might be unwieldy, but broad engagement – which has been on the rise in recent years – is vital to progress. Committed global action at every level of government, the economy, and society is needed to tackle such a complex, multifaceted challenge, and a growing awareness that time is running out should help to foster it. </p><p data-line-id="fbfa48cb28f544c184f7a59a0d95ee74"> While broad-based action is critical, however, the fact is that just a few key actors have the power to bring about a radical reduction in global emissions. More than 60% of all greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by just <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023">six economies</a>: China, the United States, India, the European Union, Russia, and Brazil (in order of total emissions). They must take the lead not only on reducing their own emissions, but also on advancing the development and diffusion of renewables and other technologies needed for the global energy transition. </p>

<p data-line-id="8295cbfead24498baf55f89bcfe829aa"> BERLIN – Hamas’s terrorist attack on October 7 has disabused many of us of our preconceived notions about the conditions for peace in the Middle East and the wider world. We are still reeling from the horrors of that day. In launching its attack, Hamas easily overcame Israel’s high-tech border security barriers without encountering any organized resistance. Its militants were able to slaughter more than 1,200 Israelis (mostly civilians) and take more than 200 hostages back to Gaza – broadcasting much of the carnage on social media. </p><p data-line-id="ce389ab77c9848da8f2befad75f823cd"> How could this have happened? With the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1211024508/israels-spy-agency-is-one-of-the-best-how-did-it-not-foresee-hamas-attacks">strongest army</a> and the best intelligence services in the Middle East, Israel presumably tracks all terrorist activities and threats on both sides of its borders. Yet it was caught off guard by a group operating strictly from the isolated and closely monitored enclave of Gaza. </p><p data-line-id="bd058e670eb341888a420e19edea6252"> The events of October 7 shattered many illusions. Outside observers and participants alike had come to believe that the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was irresolvable, and thus only manageable. The new hope was that Israel could make peace and establish diplomatic relations with neighboring Arab countries without resolving or even paying attention to the Palestine question. Peace in the Middle East would be achieved without involving the Palestinians or creating a Palestinian state. We now know that this was an illusory goal. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfce23fa8eb544e881748044bd75a2cf"> WASHINGTON, DC/BERKELEY/KYIV – On his recent visit to the United States, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/xi-jinping-hosted-by-u-s-business-leaders/">encouraged American companies</a> to regard his country as a close trading partner. In fact, US companies should be seeking to move their supply chains and other business away from China – while they still have the time. Through its deliberate and repeated actions, China is heading for an economic showdown with the US. </p><p data-line-id="ec708cf666db4671aef2d06c8502fbb9"> For many decades, Western governments have pursued versions of what Germans call <em>Wandel durch Handel</em><em> </em>(change through trade), hoping to achieve global stability, reduce international confrontation, and (perhaps) promote more democracy through economic interaction with authoritarian regimes. The idea is simple: countries that trade extensively with each other will not jeopardize the resulting profits and jobs by going to war; prosperity and interdependence mitigate aggression. </p><p data-line-id="73c48a38591645bca395a83256ffe894"> In the post-World War II era, this strategy has sometimes worked astonishingly well. The establishment of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/European-Coal-and-Steel-Community#:~:text=European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community%20(ECSC)%2C%20administrative%20agency%20established,%2C%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20and%20Luxembourg.">European Coal and Steel Community</a> in 1952 took the key inputs for weapons production out of the hands of national governments and <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/history-eu/1945-59_en">led to the European Union</a> today. Germany and France (and later other Western European countries) became tightly linked by mutual trade and investment, so that war between any of them would impose an unbearable cost on victim and aggressor alike. Western Europe, a region that for centuries had been the most prone to interstate violence (often with disastrous global spillovers), became a bastion of peace. </p>

<p data-line-id="574e1c4da445425582eb9d92fe2579bd"> CAMBRIDGE – Ten years ago, Eugene Fama and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/robert-j-shiller">Robert J. Shiller</a> were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2013/press-release/">Nobel Prize in Economics</a> (together with Lars Peter Hansen) “for their empirical analysis of asset prices.” Fama and Shiller, however, hold diametrically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/business/3-american-professors-awarded-nobel-in-economic-sciences.html">opposing views</a> on asset-price movements, from what drives the decisions of economic actors to whether markets are inherently efficient. Fifteen years after the global economic crisis, it is a disagreement worth revisiting. </p><p data-line-id="0a2ba7b660ed4273ba211ac1e9f5d6cb"> Fama is a member of the Chicago School of economics, both literally – he is a professor at the Booth School of Business – and intellectually. The Chicago School holds that economic actors are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/12/why-do-econ-classes-barely-mention-behavioral-economics/578092/">rational utility-maximizing agents</a>, able to deploy infinite cognitive capacity and complete information at all times, in order to make decisions that will best serve their material interests. With his highly influential “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486">efficient market hypothesis</a>,” Fama takes this further, positing that prices almost immediately incorporate all available information about future values, and thus accurately reflect economic fundamentals. </p><p data-line-id="e0473c27a0064042a5446380982d5b8f"> Shiller, a Yale-based behavioral economist, could not disagree more. Taking a Keynesian view of markets, he argues that, in markets shaped by “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691145921/animal-spirits">animal spirits</a>,” individual actors have irrational tendencies, which can be amplified by the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182292/narrative-economics">collective mood</a> of the market. This sometimes results in irrational and suboptimal outcomes, such as speculative asset bubbles. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4c8bec3b78e424c82f602f581edf3a6"> BEIJING – For millennia, natural infrastructure – such as river systems, wetlands, coastal plains, sand dunes, and forests – supported the development of human civilization. In fact, our ability to harness such infrastructure, for everything from food and drinking water to storm-surge protection and flood mitigation, has been central to our success as a species. And it will prove vital to our future survival. </p>
<p data-line-id="b6adf9002f674db9bb4c7d266dc47038"> Technological advances propelled the evolution of infrastructure. Green turned to grey, with concrete, cable, and steel delivering energy, communications, and transportation – and, with them, unprecedented growth and development. But while rapid modernization produced once-unimaginable prosperity, it has had grave unintended consequences, not least the environmental degradation and greenhouse-gas emissions that are jeopardizing our very existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="fa874c80706a4e2f93b05190b6fc52cb"> The question now is how to meet urgent environmental goals – reducing emissions and protecting and restoring nature and biodiversity – while enabling developing economies to fulfill their legitimate growth aspirations. The answer, as a recent <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">report</a> from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank suggests, may well begin with an explicit acknowledgement of nature as infrastructure. </p>
<p data-line-id="623b2c6a4459462ab4d5d2c064cfc631"> Viewing nature as infrastructure is transformative, because it forces us to think in a more systemic way. As we pursue growth and development, we must not only avoid damaging nature; we must also strengthen and enrich it through “nature-positive” investments – all while tapping its vast potential to deliver essential services. </p>
<p data-line-id="3bf1110a2e494b6bba469a67b702d695"> Biologists already do this when they benchmark how to restore degraded land. But now economists must get on board and enhance their tools for capturing the value and complexity of natural capital. Biodiversity, for example, covers not just the number of species, but also their genetic diversity and diversity of functions. Yet another dimension of biodiversity is the complex evolutionary history of species – when they were separated on the “tree of life.” It is only by deepening our understanding of biodiversity that we will comprehend nature’s full potential – and our impact on it. </p>
<p data-line-id="84188ef77a7e44948488c278c5695b11"> This knowledge is very site-specific, and acquiring it will require contributions from scientists and local populations. The good news is that there are already models for such collaboration. The massive <a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/a/146836">Sanbei reforestation project</a>, aimed at preventing two large deserts from merging in Northern China, was a flawed endeavor at the start, with only single tree types planted. But, over the course of two decades, deeper knowledge of the local environment and the participation of local communities transformed it into a success. </p>
<p data-line-id="5ce562e746314c7b9569bdb7dbbdea06"> Governance and incentives are also crucial to protect and nurture natural infrastructure. In Indonesia, <a href="https://en.nabu.de/topics/ecosystems/mangrove-conservation-sulawesi.html">mangroves</a> have long protected communities, particularly poorer households, from deadly tidal floods, but they are being <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/mangrove-loss-threatens-community-resilience">depleted</a> in regions with weaker state capacity. In Egypt, by contrast, efforts to restore mangroves have been aided by <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2020-12/13/c_139586420.htm">revenues</a> from eco-tourism and beekeeping, which produces honey and supports the delivery of vital pollination services. </p>
<p data-line-id="62775e698f354ad7a02c1f8475ab14f7"> The nature-as-infrastructure approach demands that we assess what nature can deliver before considering grey solutions, and it can help countries close their infrastructure gaps in truly sustainable ways. But grey infrastructure will always be necessary for growth and development. This demands that we design it better, to minimize its impact on nature. For example, renewable-energy infrastructure has a large <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/overview/index.html">ecological footprint</a>, and road infrastructure fragments and damages ecosystems. Solutions like <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">co-locating</a> infrastructure on brown sites and providing auxiliary infrastructure (such as wildlife highway crossings, green urban spaces, and nature-restoration offsets) can help mitigate these effects. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d801ad304f34e6287ef8632353494e6"> Of course, financing might pose a challenge. The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a>, agreed a year ago, assumes that <a href="https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/asian-infrastructure-finance/_common/pdf/AIIB-Asian-Infrastructure-Finance-2023-Report.pdf">$598-824 billion per year</a> will be needed by 2030 to close the biodiversity funding gap. Such sums, needed to protect and then begin to restore nature, can be generated only by valuing nature properly and creating markets that will mobilize private and institutional capital. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c6f1aa3b8f84575b83341f060d7f800"> To this end, “nature as infrastructure” must be developed as an asset class, using new tools and financial instruments. At the micro level, this will require better pricing of nature’s services – for example, usage charges or permits and taxes for damaging activities – and adaptive local regulations. Micro-level policies can support the development of other financial instruments and, eventually, markets – for performance-linked bonds, policy-based lending, debt-for-nature swaps, and nature credits, to name a few – to channel more finance into nature. Lessons from carbon markets should be heeded, to avoid repeating past mistakes. </p>
<p data-line-id="b754ddcca33a49ccb82aa4b73840680b"> Special attention must be paid to low-income economies, many of which are highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation but have rich natural endowments that should be valued properly. Multilateral development banks can catalyze the nature-as-infrastructure approach, ensuring that it is incorporated into all aspects of their operations. Ultimately, this approach should also guide individual infrastructure projects and national growth strategies. </p>
<p data-line-id="92c8215a6a52477d98df30a91f31ecf3"> The consequences of the infrastructure decisions we make today will be felt for decades to come. Only by committing to invest in green – and to build grey better – can we ensure we lay the groundwork for a fairer, more sustainable, and inclusive global economy. </p>

He is right. Unless we act decisively – beginning at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) underway in Dubai – the threat that climate change poses to humanity will become nothing short of existential. </p><p data-line-id="ed56d81a8e4b4efd9c058010ec2c63f1"> Already, climate change is a major risk multiplier for conflict and instability. Extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves have led to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/environment-disasters-and-climate-change/climate-change-and">forcible displacement</a> of more than 20 million people each year since 2008. By 2050, more than one billion people may have <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/waterresourcesmanagement">insufficient access to water</a>, and more than 200 million may be forced to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/09/13/climate-change-could-force-216-million-people-to-migrate-within-their-own-countries-by-2050">migrate</a>. </p><p data-line-id="a0d0ebb31e5746529dde3db1dac56b1f"> Water scarcity and food shortages are fueling violent conflicts in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and other parts of the world. Of the 20 countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, <a href="https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/topic/file_plus_list/rain_turns_to_dust_climate_change_conflict.pdf">12 are mired in conflicts</a>. Authoritarian countries are taking advantage of the turmoil, attempting to gain influence over fragile governments and secure access to raw materials. Unless our mitigation and adaptation efforts are equal to the climate crisis, these trends will accelerate and spread, with truly catastrophic results. </p>

<p data-line-id="f8d15fe7d3f64a6d8e3f5e3cf6317739"> AUSTIN – In a recent <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dcc702cb-0eec-4ac8-a0b8-c911a0b4f180">commentary</a> for the <em>Financial Times</em>, Martin Wolf trots out the specter of a “public-debt disaster,” that recurrent <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/debt-ceiling-yellen-spending-cuts/">staple</a> of bond-market chatter. The essence of his argument is that since debt-to-GDP ratios are high, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26f17a3f-2f64-45df-aff2-d0476dd53d42">eminent authorities</a> are alarmed, “fiscal crises” in the form of debt defaults or inflation “loom.” And that means something must be done<em>.</em></p><p data-line-id="1b05bbbaac4245ab82c30c1c692e4ab8"> While Wolf does not say explicitly what that something is, “painful fiscal choices seem to lie ahead.” Cue the chorus calling for <a href="https://www.crfb.org/issue-area/social-security">cuts</a> to Social Security and Medicare in the United States, and to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. </p><p data-line-id="6210e3a71577417fb61e166b84e6ee3b"> To bolster his argument, Wolf revisits an equation relating real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates, real growth rates, the “primary” budget deficit or surplus (net of interest payments on public debt), and the debt-to-GDP ratio. It is a familiar device, first offered up in a 1980s working paper by <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/olivier-blanchard">Olivier Blanchard</a>, then at MIT. I <a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/is-the-federal-debt-unsustainable">analyzed it in depth</a> for the Levy Economics Institute in 2011, and Blanchard recently revisited it <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/if-markets-are-right-about-long-real-rates-public-debt-ratios-will">for his blog</a>, with this conclusion: “If markets are right about long real rates, public debt ratios will increase for some time. We must make sure that they do not explode.” </p>

<p data-line-id="ade8def2233f472ea46243514fdf2532"> BERKELEY – When political leaders, policymakers, environmental advocates, and philanthropists gather for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28), food systems will be high on the agenda for the first time. Given that the food sector accounts for <a href="https://www.unido.org/stories/new-research-shows-food-system-responsible-third-global-anthropogenic-emissions">one-third</a> of all greenhouse-gas emissions, its inclusion is long overdue. </p>
<p data-line-id="def282215cb445389a6ec947c3b918b3"> But this welcome breakthrough risks being offset by the fact that COP28 is hosted by a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/petrostates-must-lead-cop28-with-global-south-investment-pledge-by-ban-ki-moon-et-al-2023-11">petrostate</a>, and presided over by the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11?a_la=english&amp;a_d=655e0b2078584c0b7cf797f6&amp;a_m=&amp;a_a=click&amp;a_s=&amp;a_p=%2Ftopic%2Fmaking-cop28-count&amp;a_li=cop28-should-adopt-oil-levy-to-fund-global-south-by-gordon-brown-2023-11&amp;a_pa=topic-commentaries&amp;a_ps=main-article-a2&amp;a_ms=&amp;a_r=">leader</a> of that petrostate’s oil company. This is particularly concerning since averting catastrophic climate scenarios requires that we phase out fossil fuels and transform food systems with equal urgency. </p>
<p data-line-id="998ad11646b34ec987be6036b462ff4c"> Fortunately, these two challenges need not compete for our attention, because transforming food systems is also a powerful way to reduce our global dependency on fossil fuels. As our organization shows in a new <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/#:~:text=and%20Frameworks%2C%20Environment-,Power%20Shift%3A%20Why%20we%20need%20to%20wean,food%20systems%20off%20fossil%20fuels&amp;text=Our%20new%20research%20shows%20that,fossil%20fuel%20emissions%20every%20year.">report</a>, <em>Power Shift: Why We Need to Wean Our Industrial Food Systems Off Fossil Fuels</em>, food systems, from farm to plate to landfill, account for at least 15% of annual global fossil-fuel use – equal to that of the European Union and Russia combined. And if the current approach to industrial food production continues, that figure is expected to increase significantly. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c8d5fed45534e37b539d733a514972f"> Today’s industrial food system is increasingly fossil fuel-intensive. Fossil fuels go into synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the plastics that are used in everything from the coatings for those pesticides and fertilizers to most food packaging. Moreover, most packaging is needed to store ultra-processed foods – from meat and dairy to sweets and sugary drinks – all of which require highly energy-intensive manufacturing and petrochemicals in the form of plastics. </p>
<p data-line-id="457115f297484bdc904e6f33cd9adca5"> Worryingly, the energy sector views the food system as a promising growth market. Food-related plastics and synthetic fertilizers account for approximately <a href="https://story.futureoffood.org/power-shift/">40%</a> of all petrochemical products, and the International Energy Agency <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/bee4ef3a-8876-4566-98cf-7a130c013805/The_Future_of_Petrochemicals.pdf">predicts</a> that petrochemicals will drive nearly half the growth in oil demand by 2050, outstripping sectors like aviation and shipping. Similarly, research from the Center for International Environmental Law has shown that fossil-fuel companies are banking on the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fossils-Fertilizers-and-False-Solutions.pdf">expansion</a> of these markets.<strong> </strong>The industry “is eyeing the food system,” CIEL’s Lisa Tostado told us, “from inputs like pesticides and fertilizers to production and processing, as a dangerous escape hatch.” </p>
<p data-line-id="52a2321b0ff54ffa9a60dd40a0610ef7"> Finally, we’re also seeing a push to use more agricultural land for incredibly inefficient energy production. The United States already dedicates about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=105761">40%</a> of its corn harvest to ethanol fuels, which are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/">estimated</a> to be “at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline.” </p>
<p data-line-id="291a9269bc8f4a1d960d9ca940bd359c"> Given increased marketing of and demand for energy-intensive food, decoupling food production from fossil fuels is essential to meet our climate goals. Even if all governments delivered on their 2030 climate pledges, <a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/power-shift-why-we-need-to-wean-industrial-food-systems-off-fossil-fuels/">fossil-fuel use</a> in the food system alone would consume our remaining 1.5° Celsius carbon budget by 2037. </p>
<p data-line-id="32dba9075718414fa8533d31b574a168"> Fortunately, there are many ways to phase out fossil fuels in food systems. These include strategies to end the use of fossil-fuel-based fertilizers and pesticides, and to move away from input-dependent crop-based energy systems like corn ethanol; shifting to renewable energy for processing, cooling, and drying food; supporting minimally processed, less energy-intensive foods and encouraging plant-rich diets; and encouraging the uptake of seasonal, locally grown food. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc2e2c285b142c887ef9f2312832fa2"> Shifting away from industrial methods toward more sustainable ways of farming not only would protect the planet. It also would create jobs, improve health, protect biodiversity, and help address the roots of hunger. Evidence from around the world <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apcnf-tca-study_2023.pdf">shows</a> that approaches like agroecology and regenerative agriculture are effective in driving a shift away from fossil-fuel dependency. With these strategies, yields remain steady or improve, while emissions fall, farmworkers’ health improves, and biodiversity is protected. </p>
<p data-line-id="9ce6951f61014c40b15b25f2f05c01a1"> There is no technical barrier to shifting from dependence on synthetic inputs toward agroecological and regenerative food production, or to replacing fossil-fuel energy with renewable sources. But many governments offer very few subsidies to support these transitions, and many more incentivize business as usual. According to the OECD, every year between 2019 and 2021, public funds totaling <a href="https://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/climatefinancereport-english.pdf">$528 billion</a> were channeled to agricultural and food-production practices that are generally bad for the climate, the environment, and human health. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a5d5b1c723e42f0a2c3abb0a34da506"> Now that we have come to understand just how endemic fossil-fuel usage is across our economies, we must take pains to ensure that <em>all</em> sectors are included in the transition to a fossil-fuel-free future. Despite COP28’s dubious staging in a petrostate, we are pleased to see food finally taking center stage. But that discussion must not be isolated from the one about ending the use of fossil fuels as fast as possible. There will be no food-systems transformation without phasing out fossil fuels, and there will be no phasing out fossil fuels without food-systems transformation. </p>

<p data-line-id="92c9be40e4bc4f4aa5fa9e040e411ba8"> LONDON – Nearly 30 years into global negotiations to address climate change, efforts to control the problem are lagging, reflecting stalled progress toward creating a sustainable trajectory more broadly. Each year of delay adds to the urgency of the problem, and of the need to maintain Earth’s resilience against the most severe effects of global warming. </p><p data-line-id="e17e191e2aa14631bd0673a1432ff5e9"> It has been 17 years since the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/the-economics-of-climate-change-the-stern-review/">Stern Review</a> alerted the world to the costs of inaction on climate change, and two years since the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review">Dasgupta Review</a> did the same for biodiversity and the ecological underpinnings of our economies. Now, a similar expert <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-water-crisis-new-economics-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2023-03">consensus</a> is emerging around water security. But most countries still do not seem to understand that neglecting water could undo the progress made on other fronts. We are facing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00800-z">global water crisis</a> that warrants the same level of attention, ambition, and action as the climate and biodiversity crises. </p><p data-line-id="d4a309acc5c049d1a240ec5b5b9ea9c7"> The links between the climate, biodiversity, and water crises point to a fundamental issue: our economies are based on flawed economics. Current economic thinking leads us to consider only the proceeds of pillaging of the planet, while ignoring externalities such as environmental damage and the liabilities they imply. This bad accounting makes us look wealthier when we are actually becoming poorer, depleting the sources of our well-being at the cost of future generations. </p>

<p data-line-id="3536dc9c23fe447caefa65e177bbf698"> DUBAI – Nation-states, presidents, and prime ministers – those are the players who garner the biggest headlines and the most media attention at each year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference. Yet for the past decade, and with far less fanfare, cities, states, and regional governments (known as “subnationals”) have been implementing the Paris climate agreement’s guidance, even when their national governments have not. This has meant investing in clean-energy systems and other urban innovations to reduce emissions locally, and sharing what works through networks like <a href="https://www.c40.org/about-c40/">C40</a> and the <a href="https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/">Global Covenant of Mayors</a> to accelerate progress on a larger scale. </p>
<p data-line-id="c566c5a192d945ff965fd1554ed2b719"> Fortunately, this year’s UN conference in Dubai (<a href="https://www.cop28.com/">COP28</a>) brings a historic first that bodes well for progress on climate change more broadly. The inaugural <a href="https://www.cop28.com/LCAS">Local Climate Action Summit</a> will bring mayors and governors together to engage directly with national and international leaders, demonstrating how cities are driving solutions and generating ideas that are being adopted around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="bc8073bdc63049fb8a7b1cfd9887c34c"> The timing for this breakthrough couldn’t be better. The UN recently released its <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/implementation-must-accelerate-to-increase-ambition-across-all-fronts-taking-an-all-of-society">first official report card</a> on the progress the world has made since COP15 in Paris. It shows that bolder and more urgent action is needed to hold global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the limit required to stave off the worst effects of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="32f38b51e50b42e2a4cfce50e95e2c39"> Cities like Freetown, which is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change (from extreme heat that rarely subsides to floods and landslides that come without warning), are determined to push world leaders to raise their ambitions – and to empower cities to do more to lead the way. </p>
<p data-line-id="6ec7243d38aa4605a0595d9a6806c43c"> Freetown has shown how cities can set an example through innovative action. When urbanization wiped out 70% of its trees, the city created a <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/winners-finalists/freetown-the-treetown/">program</a> to enlist residents in restoring green cover, which reduces the impact of severe heat. Freetown’s <a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C40_GYMF_Report4.pdf">young people</a> are a big part of the campaign to plant one million trees by 2024, and their engagement does not stop there. Young people are well represented on Freetown’s Community <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2011/en/bgdocs/hfa/16241_sle_NationalHFAprogress_2009-11.pdf">Disaster Management Committees</a> and have put their collective energy into the city’s Transform Freetown Agenda (of which the tree-planting is part). </p>
<p data-line-id="82918b710c8647b383e6f938ffad6e36"> Nor is Freetown alone. In the Philippines, Quezon City has created a network of <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-quezon-city/">sustainable urban gardens and farms</a> that addresses food insecurity among residents and reduces the emissions associated with traditional farming. In Lima, Peru, civic leaders have developed a <a href="https://interlace-hub.com/local-climate-change-plan-province-lima-peru#:~:text=The%20Local%20Climate%20Change%20Plan,prosperous,%20inclusive%20and%20resilient%20city.">climate-change plan</a> that not only aims to protect the area’s ecosystems, but also targets the small changes – park by park, orchard by orchard – that add up to large-scale improvements in the urban landscape. It has also launched a <a href="https://www.c40.org/case-studies/c40-bloomberg-awards-lima/">highly successful effort</a> to monitor and improve air quality where the city’s children play, learn, and live. </p>
<p data-line-id="ec8f1649e10847ff887e36632efee37d"> In these and many other ways, cities are showing global leaders how real progress is made. But cities should not be seen only as models; they also should be treated as essential partners in the global effort to combat climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="2d06da3f1db44797b05fd9d200216f85"> This has not typically been the case. Even where national leaders have professed their belief in multilevel governance, policy frameworks are often indifferent to local and regional climate efforts, which leads them to overlook proven solutions. At COP28 and in the years ahead, local leaders should have an equal voice in the discussion and access to the resources they need to take decisive action. </p>
<p data-line-id="bb0ccd054efb4ffa9522ce4e285b4c2b"> A true partnership between national and subnational governments could be the key that unlocks a consistent flow of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-view-from-freetown-sierra-leone/">climate financing</a>. By working together, local and national leaders can exert considerably greater influence on global institutions, including the UN, multilateral development banks, and governments with the means to accelerate climate-finance solutions. </p>
<p data-line-id="e58d8ac77d6f4b18b0a3c475ef9eea1b"> The world’s mayors are increasingly coming together to deliver this message with a unified voice. Hence, in advance of the COP28 Local Climate Action Summit, C40 modernized its leadership model to include two, rather than just one, chair. The network is now co-chaired by the mayors of London and Freetown, an arrangement that better represents the insights and experiences of the world’s people. </p>
<p data-line-id="00b6eddb9f58426aa715ade5a7148ad2"> COP28 provides an opportunity to build on the leadership of London Mayor <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sadiq-khan">Sadiq Khan</a>, who, in his previous role as C40 Chair, helped ensure that <a href="https://www.c40.org/news/c40-announces-co-chair-model-london-freetown-mayors/#:~:text=As%20chair%20of%20C40%2C%20Sadiq,Air%20Fund%2C%20and%20C40%20Cities.">two-thirds</a> of the organization’s budget is dedicated to advancing climate action in the Global South, where the effects of climate are the most severe. </p>
<p data-line-id="7f096dcc65f94048b44cfd42162bcc7c"> Local leaders around the world are proving that when we join our strengths, pool our resources, and come together in a genuine spirit of partnership, local and national governments can achieve great progress and help safeguard the future. </p>

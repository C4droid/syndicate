<p data-line-id="e646fffc97254e27a94dd2eec05bf1eb"> NEW YORK – If there’s one thing that unites virtually everyone with respect to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, it is that other people’s views are distorted by “double standards.” The belief that one party is being held to a different measure than others underlies many of the disagreements that have resonated from each conflict to contort global politics.  </p><p data-line-id="5319942cb73b40beb75543fa7f4f93d8"> Just last week, for example, the provisional order of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on South Africa’s claims that Israel is guilty of genocide was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/26/icj-gaza-decision-shores-up-rules-based-order-and-puts-west-to-test">widely interpreted through the lens of double standards</a>. Such accusations plague not just Israel and Hamas, or Russia and Ukraine, but also the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/does-the-west-have-a-double-standard-for-ukraine-and-gaza-81f72163">United States and its Western allies</a>, the <a href="https://opiniojuris.org/2024/01/03/the-icc-prosecutors-double-standards-in-the-time-of-an-unfolding-genocide/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), and even <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/11/princeton-opinion-column-institutional-neutrality-double-standard-israel-hamas">institutions of higher learning</a>. </p><p data-line-id="833df73b746f442f80e0e2533c72c55d"> But while the accusation of double standards cuts across many spheres of public life – from sexual and racial equality to sports and bathrooms – it has particular resonance in international criminal justice. The authority of all justice systems, which depend on the public’s perception of their fairness and impartiality, is vulnerable to charges of moral hypocrisy. </p><p data-line-id="d22798ff340b4adbaac93ecbf4ce4f2a"> This is especially true of international courts, such as the ICC (which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary) or those established in the 1990s and 2000s to address crimes in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Cambodia. Though some international norms and institutions have been around for decades, they are still relatively under-used, in part because most national politicians would prefer not to have someone looking over their shoulders. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly On Point newsletter" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-onpoint-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="b070f3ec19d64179bbd636d685071c0e"> International crimes lie at the intersection of law and politics, where the consequences for each case before a court can be existential for the parties involved. Prosecuting a head of state or a senior minister for grave crimes offers a rare opportunity to demonstrate the law’s ability to constrain the arbitrary exercise of power. But precisely because the stakes are so high, such prosecutions can blur the distinction between law and politics in ways that will lead some observers to doubt whether the rule of law is even possible. </p><p data-line-id="eeec677b47b242648c0fb753022474cd"> The Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals that prosecuted German and Japanese leaders after World War II set the template for the international justice movement. Among that movement’s bedrock principles are that justice is an essential foundation for enduring peace; that no one is above the law; and that individual criminal responsibility enables societies to confront what was done in their name without imposing collective punishment. </p><p data-line-id="3e65aaab492f4c38bb6a049b114d14c3"> The post-WWII tribunals developed pathbreaking legal innovations, including the new crimes of aggression, crimes against humanity, and genocide to accompany more well-settled laws and customs of war. The tribunals confirmed that individual political and military leaders can and should be held accountable for what had long been considered acts of state, and they rejected the “just-following-orders” defense (though they allowed it to be considered in sentencing). As the immediate postwar era gave way to the Cold War, these courts became, as historian Francine Hirsch of the University of Wisconsin-Madison observed of Nuremberg, “laborator[ies] for the articulation and development of a language about human rights.” </p><h2 data-line-id="c35f36eed5854741b72bb177a790650b"><strong>Born in Politics</strong></h2><p data-line-id="63b1a53fb1424dee876695ee78dd8c75"> It does not diminish the achievements of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals to note that the trials they conducted – like those that have followed – were imperfect vehicles in the search for abstract truth. In <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/soviet-judgment-at-nuremberg-9780199377930?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg</em></a>, Hirsch calls attention to the essential but previously overlooked role of the Soviet Union and its jurists in bringing the Nuremberg trials to fruition. In <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/gary-j-bass/judgement-at-tokyo/9781509812745"><em>Judgment at Tokyo</em></a><em>,</em> Princeton University historian Gary J. Bass highlights the extent to which uneven judicial leadership combined with fractious international politics to weaken the Tokyo tribunal’s symbolic resonance. </p><p data-line-id="b740464a6e414011a1b039a4da578ba6"> In other words, both seminal tribunals were born in, and riven by, emerging Cold War politics; they were plagued by real and perceived double standards and hypocrisy; and their legacies are as complicated as their origins. On one hand, they embody the immortal promise declared by Nuremberg’s American lead prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson: that “great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury [may] stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law.” On the other hand, the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials have since served as fodder for cynical politicians to pervert their meaning and exploit their shortcomings. </p>

<p data-line-id="027bd9ca477e4e80a3a1a5b35c76c771"> Nuremberg came first, was shorter (lasting just over ten months), and has always received far more attention in the West. By contrast, the Tokyo tribunal’s majority judgment belatedly relied on Nuremberg’s reasoning to uphold its own jurisdiction, took far longer (two and a half years), and was marred by visible disagreements among the 11 judges.  </p><p data-line-id="2f9e2d21583147b499f16d4cc08f4271"> Most of these disputes concerned core issues related to the Tokyo court’s legitimacy, as reflected in three dissents and two concurring opinions, as well as the slim majorities in favor of the death sentences imposed on seven accused (16 others received life imprisonment and two lesser sentences). While the main Nuremberg trial acquitted three of 21 defendants (and three of six alleged criminal organizations), none of the 25 defendants on trial at Tokyo was acquitted of all charges. </p><p data-line-id="3a86f07e671f404f91c13e52d09c0945"> The foundational principles and institutions of international criminal law did not emerge out of thin air. They were often the product of concrete political interests and contestation. That fact alone is not damning (political will is always necessary to turn rhetoric into reality), but legitimacy is harder to secure if the lofty rhetoric surrounding international justice fails to take stock of the politics in which it is embedded. </p><p data-line-id="4b764c2b202b4120899d400c25e7d355"> As Hirsch shows, proposals for an international criminal court to prosecute crimes of aggression (“persons violating peace” and “acts infringing on peace”) emerged in the 1930s in the Soviet Union, where they were “prompted by the looming threat of [Nazi] Germany and Japan, who had just signed the Anti-Comintern Pact that was clearly directed against the Soviet Union.” Aron Trainin, a Russian scholar and editor who advised the Soviet prosecution at Nuremberg, was a principal source of these ideas. </p><p data-line-id="416615212ba94d9191ff174b19f79b3c"> Over the next decade, Soviet politics took many twists and turns – from the 1939 Non-Aggression Pact to the loss of more than 20 million people in a war of survival with Hitler. Although the United Kingdom and the United States agreed, on October 7, 1942, to establish a commission to investigate German atrocities, it was the Soviets who called (just a week later) for Nazi leaders to be tried by a “special international tribunal” and punished with “all of the severity of criminal law.” When the British ambassador to Moscow suggested that the Allied leaders issue “an executive decree … that Hitler should hang,” Stalin saw, and argued for, “the propaganda value of an international tribunal.” </p><p data-line-id="b458762fc0654dcc8e8d89ad35b42685"> Of course, as with the infamous Moscow show trials of the 1930s, which lacked due-process protections for the accused, Stalin’s proposal was predicated on the presumption of defendants’ guilt. But as the war came to an end, the Allies saw both Nuremberg and Tokyo as important opportunities to advance and affirm their respective narratives about the causes, consequences, and meaning of the war. “Everyone understood that the way the events of the previous decade were presented in the Nuremberg courtroom had tremendous implications – not just for the verdicts but for the entire postwar order,” Hirsch writes. “Justice was at stake; so was realpolitik.” </p><p data-line-id="4d12c3d2562048409977c9b4b7d824ed"> While the US government viewed a trial as an opportunity “to showcase American leadership and the rule of law,” Soviet leaders believed that helping the world “grasp the sheer magnitude of Soviet losses … [would] expose Nazi crimes and … facilitate Moscow’s claims for material compensation and German labor.” Moreover, an international tribunal would “give the Soviets the opportunity to take their place among the postwar powers.” </p><h2 data-line-id="870f8b32ecfd436a8400388418db2b85"><strong>Who Decides?</strong></h2><p data-line-id="c95a66a65d7d40a8adffcba61dd70e2c"> For political as well as other reasons, the choice of defendants in both cases was left to the military victors. US President Harry S. Truman’s administration decided that the Tokyo tribunal should prosecute only “a relatively small clique of senior military officers” among the many Japanese implicated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or crimes of aggression. (Each of the occupying powers in Japan was permitted to set up its own national courts for lower-ranking war criminals, and 5,700 were ultimately prosecuted that way, leading to 984 executions.) Though “historically and morally dubious,” Bass argues, this “selective guilt” served a number of US political aims: </p><p data-line-id="00599cd25c184cdeb9bf1ddffe87aedb"> “It would help to delegitimize and sideline the coup-prone military officers who were most likely to threaten democracy; it would slake the American public’s demand for vengeance; it would help the Japanese public disavow their wartime leadership and embrace a new constitutional order congenial to the United States. … And it would speed Japan’s rehabilitation on the world stage, letting it become an American ally in the Cold War.”  </p><p data-line-id="3ace3b28fa2d428a94980288a45e59fc"> As a result, only 16 military officials and 12 civilians were indicted in Tokyo. Despite Emperor Hirohito’s clear responsibility for some of the alleged crimes, the Truman administration decided not to include him, as he would be crucial in preventing further Japanese resistance and facilitating Japanese society’s acceptance of American leadership. </p><p data-line-id="5b93042dc6c240708e613b0aa2951c0e"> The influence of politics was also apparent in how the Soviet prosecutors and tribunal staff operated at Nuremberg. As Hirsch explains, while the other Allied prosecutorial teams communicated with their national political leadership, they had “far more autonomy than Soviet personnel,” whose presentations, questions for witnesses, and even final dissenting judicial opinion drafts were written, edited, and reviewed by political leaders in Moscow, up to and including Stalin. </p><p data-line-id="fdb34e8ec47e4dd3813bc2b52be20038"> Stalin designated Andrei Vyshinsky, the lead prosecutor in the 1930s Moscow show trials, to lead a secret Commission for Directing the Work of the Soviet Representatives in the International Tribunal and the Committee of Chief Prosecutors in Nuremberg. Likewise, Mark Raginsky was appointed to the prosecution team at Nuremberg precisely because he “had proven his mettle to Vyshinsky in the 1930s show trials, where his lack of scruples as an investigator had helped seal the fate of Stalin’s enemies.” The same fidelity to Stalin also guided the appointments of Roman Rudenko as lead Nuremberg prosecutor for the USSR and Iona Nikitchenko as the Soviet judge on the tribunal. </p><p data-line-id="089847b36df146ce8db538471fb547bc"> Vyshinsky’s commission served as a mechanism for keeping “Soviet leaders closely informed about the course of the trial and forwarding all proposals (regarding procedure, documentary evidence, witnesses …) to them for review,” Hirsch writes. “The Soviet prosecutors, judges and support staff all knew that they were in Nuremberg to do [Vyshinsky’s] bidding and that their fates rested in his hands.”  </p><p data-line-id="e85521c170e84f5085f20baec33dfb17"> Commission officials did not hesitate to “direct” the Soviet judges to “feel out” the other judges on matters of interest, to remind them of “the importance of keeping Moscow in the loop about all of the Tribunal’s private deliberations,” and to “censure” them for “failing to convince the other judges” of certain issues. The choice of reliable Soviet regime enforcers was also apparent at Tokyo. </p><p data-line-id="5d9542c7be6741c2af8c49e15edcf073"> At both tribunals, the imperative of justice was tempered by the rapid onset of the Cold War and the rise of a US foreign policy centered around anti-Communism. Hence, far more than France or the Soviet Union, the US and the UK increasingly saw strategic value in releasing and rehabilitating German and Japanese scientists and others despite being suspected of war crimes. </p><h2 data-line-id="536151ad59eb4d18864a49bf1ec10c2c"><strong>Selective Justice</strong></h2><p data-line-id="ad272d0548eb4c1abb42b8848a79b580"> As contemporary debates make clear, the more susceptible to political influence legal institutions are, the more severely their legitimacy can be compromised. Unfortunately, neither of the postwar tribunals was free of double standards, which affected which crimes were and were not prosecuted, who was and was not charged, and who issued the indictments and did the judging. While the Nuremberg trial rightly addressed Nazi crimes, Hirsch notes that all four chief prosecutors agreed “that they would work together to steer clear of topics that might be damaging to any of the countries of the prosecution.” </p><p data-line-id="3e16b870aca9454cac5ac449bb90ff01"> In practice, the Soviets had the most to conceal, though they were ultimately not very successful in doing so. For example, it did not go unnoticed that they were strong advocates for including the crime of aggression in the indictment, even though they had themselves invaded Finland and Poland in 1939 and had annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania the following year. </p><p data-line-id="004a78a1bf394b47abcbbcc4f9cec752"> Not only that, the Soviets also made the strategic error of successfully arguing to indict Germans for the 1940 massacre of some 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals at several sites, including the Katyn Forest outside Smolensk. Their elaborate fabrication of evidence failed to persuade the three Western judges of German culpability, and subsequently released evidence has confirmed that the Soviets committed the murders. Similarly, the Kremlin failed to prevent publication during the trial of the embarrassing secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact, which partitioned Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. </p><p data-line-id="d3e74f41359e4fa3bfded0dfefc7ca30"> While Soviet crimes were the most egregious among the Allies, the Soviets were hardly the only ones seeking to shape the proceedings in their own interests. In considering what constituted “crimes against humanity,” Jackson expressed America’s desire to limit the definition, lest it grow to encompass “regrettable circumstances at times in our own country in which minorities are unfairly treated.” In the end, Article 6 of the charter did confine itself to crimes committed “in execution of or in connection with” another crime “within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.” This meant the court could address only crimes against humanity committed by Germany in connection with the pursuit of aggressive war. </p><p data-line-id="a7f628abad80410ab80ebe9e4d14439a"> In Tokyo, the US government covered up what it knew about a secret Japanese army unit that had conducted biowarfare experiments on human subjects, because it wanted to safeguard this knowledge for its own military purposes. As a result, none of the Japanese attacks carried out with germ bombs and spray on Chinese cities from 1940 to 1942 were included in the indictment. Dutch judge Bert Röling later observed that this cover-up “severely damaged” the trial’s authority, and Bass himself concludes that “the failure to prosecute the Japanese involved in biowarfare is one of the gravest stains of the Tokyo tribunal.” </p><p data-line-id="5f1d19f4b88b473290d248527caece61"> As Indian judge Radhabinod Pal’s scathing 1,200-page dissent emphasized, the Tokyo proceedings were built on multiple layers of colonialism and racism. Even as the trial was underway, some of the European allies were fighting to retain their colonial possessions in French Indochina (today’s Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam), the Dutch East Indies (which would become Indonesia), and British Malaysia and Singapore. The US ultimately consented to add two judges – from India and the Philippines – beyond its initial proposal of nine (US, UK, France, Netherlands, USSR, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China), because the State Department deemed it “politically desirable to avoid being placed in a position of discriminating against Asiatic Countries.” </p><p data-line-id="be4e99776d9f46068656c4454c96654e"> Of course, though Western racism against Japan was pervasive, the Empire of Japan had itself sought to impose a “New Order” on the peoples of East and Southeast Asia. A major paradox of the Tokyo tribunal’s aggression charges was that they included Japanese attacks against British, French, and Dutch colonial possessions. As Bass shows, the indictments had been carefully worded to protect the Allies’ various empires: “Only [crimes in] India and the Philippines, on the verge of independence, would warrant their own counts in the indictment. The Indonesians would be spoken for by Dutchmen and the Vietnamese by Frenchmen, and the Koreans not at all.” </p><p data-line-id="41555a2f31b74752bb57b9730b665d9e"> Without flinching, the Dutch prosecution defended “the territorial integrity of the Netherlands Indies.” And in demonstrating Japanese responsibility for aggression against French Indochina, “The prosecutors at Tokyo breezed past the awkward fact that if any French authority was being trampled in Indochina, it was that of Vichy France. This put [them] in the dicey position of upholding the imperial territorial claims of German collaborators.” Bass concludes that the “tacit, structural acquiescence with European imperialism did much to tarnish the legitimacy of the Tokyo tribunal.” </p><h2 data-line-id="9d2baebdb52a4b1ea2601f8c03ec6f2f"><strong>Accountability for Thee, Not for Me</strong></h2><p data-line-id="7bab0eb9e0a24c688c470b072971d04a"> Given how the trials were carried out, it is no surprise that they met early and often with the accusation of meting out victors’ justice. The Nuremberg Charter expressly <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf">limited its jurisdiction</a> to “the major war criminals of the European Axis,” and the judges subsequently ruled that alleged war crimes committed by the Allies, such as the large-scale bombing of German civilians, lay outside the Tribunal’s scope. In more stilted language, the <a href="https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/04/4-06/military-tribunal-far-east.html">Tokyo Charter</a> limited its reach to “far Eastern war criminals.” </p><p data-line-id="52d2ac5daef64e8791582030f7f6c415"> Nobody was surprised when lead Tokyo defendant and former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki complained of “trial by conquerors.” But no less an anti-Communist American institution than <em>Time </em>magazine also expressed misgivings, concluding at the end of the trial that, “the world is no farther along than it was in 1945 to an understanding of whether these proceedings represent justice or victor’s vengeance.” </p><p data-line-id="5678cd512636457ab509d953c228cf07"> The US government, through its Supreme Commander for the Allied Forces in Occupied Japan, General Douglas MacArthur, who established the Tokyo tribunal and promulgated its governing charter, played the dominant role in judging Japanese crimes. And it did so after having just dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of civilians. Not only were the judges selected as representatives of victor countries, but two had personally experienced Japanese atrocities. </p><p data-line-id="526227ed07fd4bf1a76a5635f8f90888"> The Philippine judge, Delfín Jaranilla, was forced to take part in the infamous Bataan death march in 1942. When defense counsel sought to remove him because of “personal bias,” the court responded that it had no authority to alter an appointment made by MacArthur. Similarly, Chinese judge Mei Ruao was both a witness to and a victim of crimes committed by Japanese forces, who burned his home in Nanjing and forced him and his family to flee to the Chinese interior. </p><p data-line-id="3bfe1f59a4a94a77a17b4ea79563013e"> Finally, both the Nuremberg and Tokyo proceedings were plagued by the accusation that, through their jurisprudential advances, they imposed retroactive punishments for actions – aggression, crimes against humanity, genocide – that had not been clearly illegal at the time they were carried out. </p><h2 data-line-id="bca9f47ecbf7433a9588acb016c773c5"><strong>Mixed Legacies</strong></h2><p data-line-id="71de776c420d45d1a5d42660a503b8d6"> Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the postwar tribunals were seminal events. Just before he testified to the Nazi onslaught against his people in Vilna (Lithuania), Abraham Sutzkever, a Jewish poet who miraculously survived, prophesied that “the name of Nuremberg would go down in history for eternity: first as the place of the Nuremberg Laws and now as the place of the Nuremberg Trials.” </p><p data-line-id="0cf99c9b57404abf93085323944edda3"> Similarly, lead French prosecutor François de Menthon declared in his opening address that Nuremberg would constitute “a decisive act in the history of international law.” More than three-quarters of a century later, the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals – accountability for the worst crimes, impartial and individualized justice, an authoritative factual record for history – continue to resonate. </p><p data-line-id="6b2bbfeb866642ab96bf47dfc352210e"> There were also more concrete effects. Nuremberg laid a foundation for political changes in Germany that, over time, would vividly demonstrate what a genuine reckoning with the past looks like.  </p><p data-line-id="2fe900dc54454967b3e2dc8c322af0e2"> After domestic war-crimes trials in Germany in the 1960s came West German Chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling at the memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto in 1970, President Richard von Weizsäcker’s 1985 speech calling on Germans not to deny but to learn from their Nazi history, and, following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the rise of a broader “memory culture” in the newly unified Germany. More recently, Germany’s efforts to atone for its past have led it always to prioritize Israel’s security as a <em>Staatsräson</em> (reason of state), even if doing so might stifle Palestinian and other voices demanding Nuremberg-style legal accountability for those responsible for possible crimes in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. </p><p data-line-id="62306ec10e804cf2970f1bf7eaa1ddf3"> Though its legacy is more contested, the Tokyo tribunal demonstrated the challenge, importance, and possibility of piercing the veil of impunity that for many centuries had protected senior leaders responsible for grave crimes. Moreover, though they were not classified as such, acts of sexual violence were successfully prosecuted as war crimes. This was a significant achievement that helped set the stage for the prosecution of rape and other crimes of sexual violence at the Yugoslavia tribunal, the ICC, and in other courts. </p><p data-line-id="3b1aa3e72aea4e9aa5861b09233ccc94"> Yet in the decades since, WWII’s victors have at times undermined and distorted the tribunals’ achievements, even exploiting their shortcomings for political purposes. Following revelations of US abuses during the Vietnam War, Nuremberg prosecutor Telford Taylor wondered whether the American people were able to “examine their own conduct under the same principles that they applied to the Germans and Japanese at the Nuremberg and other war crimes trials?” </p><p data-line-id="16c90e1f36fc4f228aab0a975be4d0ba"> In 2002, fellow Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz <a href="https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/justiceontrial/nuremberg_print.html">lamented</a> that by declining to join the ICC, “What the United States is saying is that we don’t want the rule of law. I think that is dangerous, very dangerous. Because we cannot lay down a law for the United States and not for the rest of the world. That doesn’t fly. Justice Jackson made that clear at Nuremberg. Law must apply to everyone equally or it’s not law at all.” In another egregious double standard, Russia and China have also refused to join the ICC, even though their permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council grants them a veto over matters referred to the court. </p><p data-line-id="9fad127ec700443a80de3472fb8f0207"> Today, Ukrainians invoke Nuremberg to support their demand for Russia’s leadership to be held accountable for aggression and war crimes. At the same time, as Hirsch observes, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly laid claim to both the ideals of Nuremberg and its selective approach to justice in advancing his narrative of victimhood and nationalist zeal. A proposed plan for Ukraine’s “de-Nazification,” <a href="https://ccl.org.ua/en/news/ria-novosti-has-clarified-russias-plans-vis-a-vis-ukraine-and-the-rest-of-the-free-world-in-a-program-like-article-what-russia-should-do-with-ukraine-2/">published</a> by a Russian state news agency in April 2022, proclaimed that by convening a public tribunal, the Kremlin would “act as the guardian of the [legacy of the] Nuremberg Trials.” </p><p data-line-id="7b8cc8e5210e46afb8eb8f595c768e16"> In Japan, the biases that infected the 1946-48 trial provided ammunition for right-wing nationalists in succeeding decades to discredit the judgment and gloss over Japan’s WWII-era crimes. As Bass describes it, the decision to leave Emperor Hirohito on the throne for decades after WWII allowed advocates of a more revanchist Japan to underscore their continuity with the Empire. Equally, nationalists seized on Pal’s own indictment of the Allies’ protection of Western imperial interests to disparage the Tokyo proceedings and justify Japan’s WWII behavior. </p><p data-line-id="21fa00dd52254536b1931d7274b9fec1"> Against this backdrop, the late <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/abe-shinzo">Abe Shinzō</a>, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister and the grandson of the prominent revisionist Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, once proclaimed that Japan must “depart from the postwar regime” and recover its national independence. During his two terms in office (in 2006-07 and again in 2012-20), Abe visited the notorious Yasukuni shrine to Japan’s military heroes, where he repeated the longstanding complaint of “victors’ justice” leveled against the Tokyo trial’s judgment. According to Bass, Japan today remains “shackled to narratives about its wartime past that are morally odious and historically dubious.”   </p><p data-line-id="68b0e09b3ebe457aa7d90afe6d424e5a"> The unresolved tensions at Tokyo have also continued to simmer in South Korea and China, nurturing competing narratives about the history and meaning of WWII. The debilitating effect of applying different standards to different parties engaged in criminal activity was poignantly described by none other than former US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in the 2003 documentary <a href="https://www.errolmorris.com/film/fow_transcript.html"><em>The Fog of War</em></a>: </p><p data-line-id="4a895ef4084e4e03b83e71ee95e3dfff"> “[Former US General Curtis] LeMay [who oversaw the US strategic bombing of Japanese cities,] said, ‘If we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.’ And I think he’s right. He, and I’d say I, were behaving as war criminals. LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost. But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?” </p><p data-line-id="0973f78c83c94a359641bd93fa849659"> To be sure, no one was prosecuted at Nuremberg or Tokyo specifically for the indiscriminate aerial bombings of civilians, in part because international law on aerial bombardment was limited during WWII. But McNamara’s point underscores the law’s dependence on political and military power, and the ever-present risk that double standards will pervert justice.  </p><h2 data-line-id="0e4d22432d744f298c97c7c47ae9c1c7"><strong>The World Is Watching</strong></h2><p data-line-id="3243eace1fa34bbaab8c584bb7bb622a"> Owing largely to the contributions of Nuremberg, Tokyo, and their progeny, international law has grown more expansive, specific, authoritative, and publicly known since WWII. It is now far more difficult to conceal atrocities when they take place, since digital technology can deliver evidence of war crimes from around the world into investigators’ hands in a matter of seconds. Notwithstanding the recent rise of authoritarianism, political awareness of the possibility of legal accountability has grown substantially alongside popular demands for the protection of human rights and dignity. Though crimes continue to happen before our eyes, the political cost of killing civilians in mass numbers has increased.  </p><p data-line-id="657d91af639b408aac32c0a677c8c113"> Yes, the same kinds of horrific crimes recur, not just in Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine, but also in Yemen, Sudan, Mexico, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Although we cannot eliminate the nefarious influence of political self-interest and double standards that tilt the balance of international-justice mechanisms to favor the powerful, we can still do more to heighten scrutiny of double standards and augment public appreciation of what is at stake. </p><p data-line-id="2a244ff069b142e580dc7fe7f8023a35"> To that end, we should continue to diversify the legal pathways to accountability for grave crimes – from the ICC and the ICJ to the application of universal jurisdiction in national courts. And we can learn from both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. In their poignant histories, Bass and Hirsch remind us that fairly prosecuting senior officials for high crimes is a monumental challenge well worth pursuing.  <br/></p><ul class="list list--intro" data-line-id="7774ff64854f4521921fd963ab956a06"><li><strong><em>Gary J.

<p data-line-id="f26b335345d14012861a7ac1dd849d8b"> GENEVA – The pledges made at last year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai reflect the growing political will to tackle climate change head on and in an equitable way. But while governments are taking the lead in accelerating the green transition, they cannot finance it alone. Fortunately, the appetite for sustainable investment is greater than ever: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assets are expected to reach <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/mubadala/the-future-of-esg-Investing">$50 trillion</a> in 2025. The difficulty lies in matching investors with viable green projects. </p>
<p data-line-id="7c0018f738ff48a8af0f6f22132b27a5"> Achieving the global goal of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition">net-zero emissions</a> by 2050 requires coordinated investment on a scale never before seen. Goldman Sachs recently estimated that roughly <a href="https://www.gsam.com/responsible-investing/en-GB/professional/insights/articles/the-energy-transition-trinity">$4 trillion</a> – 4% of global GDP – in annual clean-energy investment will be needed to reach this target every year for the next decade. Yet, as it stands, only <a href="https://time.com/6250469/clean-energy-investment-sets-1-1-trillion-record-matching-fossil-fuels-for-the-first-time/">$1.1 trillion</a> is being invested in decarbonization each year, with a focus on lower-risk, subsidy-driven technologies such as wind and solar generation and electric vehicles (EVs). </p>
<p data-line-id="abd37a8f26194dcb85e0664454d97df8"> Given this shortfall, and governments’ limited financial resources, the private sector must find innovative ways to attract investment in projects that will slow global warming and ensure a just energy transition for all. Success will depend on a strong incentive to deliver results for the climate and the economy; sufficient investment capital; and the development of an ecosystem of technical, finance, and operational specialists with the skills needed to execute the net-zero transition – a crucial but underappreciated variable. </p>
<p data-line-id="5e44e253e6d04ca78d20b1a05585e613"> Similar ecosystems in other sectors, such as biotech, have shown how a coordinated group of experts working together closely can help accelerate progress. While such a group has yet to form for green industry, owing to its fragmentation, all the ingredients are there. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="41ae983c13954a9982c2124b258a3f5c"> A crucial part of mobilizing new climate-finance flows is identifying alternative investment options that are attractive to a wide range of investors, both geographically and in terms of size. Today’s biggest investors focus too much on large-scale commitments and high-impact headlines. For example, news from the recent COP28 summit centered on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-set-announce-30-billion-climate-finance-fund-cop28-sources-2023-11-30/">multibillion-dollar pledges</a> from massive private investment groups such as Brookfield, Apollo, and TPG, whose combined assets under management total around $12 trillion. </p>
<p data-line-id="1d51b5cd23f34515896f9f539ef04df9"> The funding requirements for green projects, including in clean energy (hydrogen, carbon sequestration, biogas, battery storage, waste recycling, and more), transport (EVs), agri-tech, and hard-to-abate heavy industries, are growing rapidly. But these projects are becoming divided between large, government-led infrastructure initiatives and smaller to mid-size ones driven by the private sector. Financing the full spectrum is essential to tackle climate change effectively. </p>
<p data-line-id="b2ec10abef0444e38867dc7311df5996"> This is where digital platforms can help. By matching investors with green projects in the smaller to mid-size category (valued below $250 million for an individual project), they could bring greater visibility to initiatives of this size while also indicating their bankability. Furthermore, such platforms should facilitate access to expert service providers – from law firms to technical advisers and ESG consultants – who can support the transaction and the project more generally, and should be facilitated by a drive to standardize documentation. Previous efforts have centered on crowdfunding micro-projects and pushing the public sector to take the lead, and thus never attained the critical mass needed for a functioning ecosystem. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c9ef15dfae046aca6458c1c7d1f9bfc"> One new digital platform that could help reach this critical mass is <a href="https://verd-ex.co/">VerdEx</a>, which is launching this month and has strategic partners around the world. By shining a light on bankable projects that require funding and offering an ecosystem of relevant specialists, VerdEx aims to connect institutional investors to green projects in the smaller to mid-size category and reduce friction, which would lower overall financing costs. Moreover, VerdEx will invest a portion of its revenue in an impact fund to help deliver a just and equitable energy transition. </p>
<p data-line-id="f7d51de122f84e5591b25c5f5ec44a38"> Efforts like this will be critical to attracting a wider range of institutional investors to less gargantuan, but no less important, green projects. With governments and private investment funds remaining focused on big-ticket projects, this type of matchmaking will help us use all avenues available to reduce global emissions and meet our climate commitments. </p>

<p data-line-id="680b193656194f52bea1119f7b8de625"> LONDON – What kinds of economic policies should centrist reformers pursue? The standard answer is that they should target innovation-driven economic growth and a fair distribution of income. Achieving these goals simultaneously would be difficult under normal circumstances. Nowadays, the clash of identities threatening to tear apart many democratic societies makes it even harder. </p><p data-line-id="5185f27a411a45bbb144171b0580f701"> According to conventional wisdom, a fairer distribution of income is the best way to defang identity politics. In fact, the opposite is true: unless we address the identity clash head-on, politics will become so nasty and intractable that spurring innovation and reducing economic inequality, let alone improving public services and curbing climate change, could become impossible. </p><p data-line-id="6cf80670a1a847cc9ff1f8763acc2d45"> Part of the answer is candidate choice: elitist, aloof leaders will be perceived that way by voters. Policies also can play a role, but not just any policies. The key is to transmit one fundamental message to voters: government is working for <em>you</em>, not for elites of some kind or for friends in the party establishment. </p>

<p data-line-id="24f8b2c3a31f45f3b21cac32119c8a3a"> PRINCETON – What should democracies do about parties that use elections and other democratic means to destroy democracy itself? One well-established, but not universally accepted, answer is to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/43728/chapter-abstract/367620407?redirectedFrom=fulltext">ban the party</a> before it comes to power. </p><p data-line-id="0ab01d24d7cf495fb5b21ce0648c041a"> But what about individual politicians? Americans are heatedly debating that question now that various legal challenges have sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/is-barring-trump-from-office-undemocratic">disqualify</a> former President Donald Trump from running for a second term, owing to his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. The same question is also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68029232">preoccupying Germans</a> who want to stop the rise of the far right. One proposal would strip individual leaders of political rights while stopping short of banning the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party outright. </p><p data-line-id="b3db3d9198b44cf9852357b72035e396"> Such measures are serious restrictions on the political process that should only ever be used as a last resort. But when an individual has a consistent record of agitating against democracy – even after plenty of warnings – disqualification from the democratic process is indeed justified. Otherwise, democracies place themselves in mortal jeopardy. As Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels infamously <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802532">gloated</a>: “This will always remain one of the best jokes of democracy, that it gave its deadly enemies the means by which it was destroyed.” </p>

<p data-line-id="affe542ac09c43bcbd94fc9db011d199">As Israel’s war against Hamas nears the end of its fourth month, Israeli civilians are still being held hostage by Hamas, most of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have been displaced, and the risk of a wider regional conflagration is rising. But while a growing number of actors, including within Israel, are calling for a pause to the fighting, there is good reason to doubt that Israel’s right-wing government will curb its operations in Gaza.</p>

In the nineteenth century, Charles Dickens <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Martin_Chuzzlewit.html?id=KnMOzwEACAAJ">observed</a> that if Americans are to be believed, their country “always is depressed, and always is stagnated, and always is at an alarming crisis, and never was otherwise.” On a 1979 magazine <a href="https://envisioningtheamericandream.com/2015/01/13/a-tear-for-lady-liberty/">cover</a> about national decline, the Statue of Liberty has a tear rolling down her cheek.  </p><p data-line-id="898722132ae9497b9c31085c25d3995b"> But while Americans have long been drawn to what I call the “golden glow of the past,” the US has never had the power many imagine it did. Even with preponderant resources, America has often failed to get what it wants. Those who think that today’s world is more complex and tumultuous than in the past should remember a year like 1956, when the US was unable to prevent <a href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/lw/107186.htm#:~:text=In%20October%2C%201956%2C%20the%20Soviet,dissent%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Bloc.">Soviet repression</a> of a revolt in Hungary; and when our allies Britain, France, and Israel <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/why-was-the-suez-crisis-so-important">invaded</a> the Suez. To <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41063258">paraphrase</a> the comedian Will Rogers, “hegemony ain’t what it used to be and never was.” Periods of “declinism” tell us more about popular psychology than about geopolitics. </p>

<p data-line-id="7b43193ed7eb475f9024c0430a7f02de"> CAMBRIDGE – In 1944, as World War II neared its end, the exiled Hungarian economic sociologist Karl Polanyi published <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/461123/the-great-transformation-by-polanyi-karl/9780241685556"><em>The Great Transformation</em></a>, a treatise that focused on the dangers of trying to separate economic systems from the societies they inhabit. Eighty years on, Polanyi’s warnings about a market economy unleashed from human needs and relations may prove prescient. In fact, the future that he foretells bears a strong resemblance to Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, in which the doctor’s creature runs amok and eventually turns on its creator. </p><p data-line-id="bbafe25e348e4ababfc5f799240d0e91"> That future may be upon us. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-28/democracy-election-authoritarianism-voting">biggest election year in history</a>, people in dozens of countries, representing half of the world’s population, will <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/03/national-elections-democracy-2024-nationalism-misinformation-technology/">go to the polls</a>. The list includes the world’s two largest democracies (India and the United States) and three of its most populous countries (Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). And the European Union, comprising nearly half a billion people from 27 countries, will hold parliamentary elections. </p><p data-line-id="cebbff313c6d465c96725732e5c5652a"> Many <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/03/2024-elections-us-eu-portugal-austria-bangladesh-india-south-africa-indonesia-mexico-taiwan/">commentators</a> and <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/01/10/democracy-and-geopolitics-are-on-ballot-in-2024-pub-91357">experts</a> view this global synchronicity as a kind of plebiscite on the postwar global order. So far, the popular reviews do not look favorable. Some argue that the world is experiencing a “<a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/facing-up-to-the-democratic-recession/">democratic recession</a>,” citing evidence of <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-global-freedom-declines-17th-consecutive-year-may-be-approaching-turning-point">declining levels of global freedom</a>, authoritarian backsliding, and attacks on free and fair elections. Naturally, all of this raises the question of how we got from the blinding hope that accompanied the end of the Cold War – what <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/francis-fukuyama">Francis Fukuyama</a> famously called the “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184">end of history</a>” – to today’s profound disillusionment. </p>

<p data-line-id="fc56d69f7e584c17bfe1cc777e82179f"> LONDON – After reaching its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191077/inflation-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/">highest level</a> in decades in mid-2022, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-interest-rates-economy-federal-reserve-53d93610b5ccaacd097853593f29bc26">inflation</a> in the United States and the eurozone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/business/eurozone-inflation-november.html">fell sharply</a> over the second half of last year. But, in December, the headline <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/01/11/december-2023-cpi-report/#:~:text=Inflation%20as%20measured%20by%20the,percent%20in%202023%20(from%20Dec.">consumer price index</a> (CPI) in the US and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/prc_hicp_manr/default/table?lang=en&amp;category=prc.prc_hicp">Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices</a> (HICP) in the eurozone rose slightly. Was it an aftershock or a foreshock? </p><p data-line-id="ad98cc08951e48a291a3e57d27dfe280"> The speed of last year’s disinflation surprised many, not least central banks, which have insisted that it is too early to claim victory. But are they urging caution because they believe that there is persistent underlying inflationary pressure – which might explain the recent uptick – or are they simply acknowledging uncertainty? </p><p data-line-id="c258ca5c528b42ada375a58bea8bd288"> Markets seem to be embracing the latter explanation, anticipating that both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will start cutting interest rates in the spring. This sentiment is not unfounded: if we consider the six-month annual percentage change in core inflation – a timelier indicator of underlying inflation than the 12-month change – both the <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce">US</a> and the <a href="https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news/4158247/euro-inflation-edges-closer-target-november-fall">eurozone</a> have brought inflation back down to their 2% target. The evidence points to a persistent decline, regardless of the recent (small) increase in headline figures. </p>

<p data-line-id="44ea2457142343c9aad9fe4a97284b17"> FLORENCE – The 25th anniversary of the euro’s introduction, which has passed largely under the radar, offers an opportune moment to assess the current state of the greatest monetary experiment in modern history. </p><p data-line-id="2d9b3d29463f43ad991aa1f8fcc37545"> The euro’s launch in January 1999 polarized economists. In the face of much skepticism – the late American economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/martin-feldstein">Martin Feldstein</a> even <a href="https://www2.nber.org/feldstein/fa1197.html">argued</a> that the single currency could trigger a war in Europe – the euro’s architects envisioned a future characterized by macroeconomic stability, anchored by an independent central bank and a fiscal framework geared toward stability. Structural reforms, which the European Union’s member states were expected to implement, were meant to enhance the monetary union’s capacity to adjust to shocks. </p><p data-line-id="0b0051104ed04f808bff90a4727875cc"> None of those scenarios materialized. Over the past quarter-century, the euro has shown extraordinary resilience, navigating through several critical challenges and defying early predictions of its collapse. But while the single currency has delivered on some of its promises – most notably, maintaining price stability for most of its existence – it has failed to boost Europe’s potential growth or facilitate the continent’s full economic and political integration. </p>

<p data-line-id="c4af78aec747492dade40762d1a27c95"> HONG KONG – As the wars in Ukraine and Gaza show, energy markets are highly vulnerable to geopolitical developments. At the same time, energy is the main driver of global geopolitical competition – a point that <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/helen-thompson-1">Helen Thompson</a> of the University of Cambridge has often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5q2AQ92GYU">highlighted</a>. The rivalry between the United States and China is no exception. </p><p data-line-id="ec7c069288bc44979403b080804eff06"> The relationship between energy and geopolitics came to the fore during the Industrial Revolution. Western countries harnessed wind, coal, and steam power to increase productivity sharply and achieve unprecedented prosperity at home, while colonizing faraway lands and appropriating their resources. It was control over energy that enabled the West to consolidate its economic, political, military, and scientific dominance over the rest of the world. </p><p data-line-id="37647be692384d33a37f9ac383d87114"> Geopolitical competition has since amounted essentially to a fight over human capital and natural resources – especially energy resources. For Germany and Japan, World War II was partly about securing vital oil resources in southeastern Europe and Southeast Asia, respectively. A number of other conflicts – from the two Gulf Wars to Russia’s current war against Ukraine – can be considered largely <a href="https://energypost.eu/twenty-first-century-energy-wars-oil-gas-fuelling-global-conflicts/">energy wars</a>. </p>

<p data-line-id="4763ae7bd66e4344b7463752301e4796"> BERLIN – In his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/616914/an-immense-world-by-ed-yong/"><em>An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us</em></a><em>, </em>science writer Ed Yong describes how every mammal, fish, insect – all life forms on Earth – is “enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world.” That sensory bubble is the creature’s <em>Umwelt, </em>the “part of those surroundings that an animal can sense and experience – its <em>perceptual </em>world.” Two creatures can be “standing in the same physical space,” and yet, “have completely different <em>Umwelten</em>.” </p><p data-line-id="5e9bef0bf56a4d9bb3fd0dbc951cbf95"> This raises a fundamentally important question: Do all humans share the same <em>Umwelt</em>? Or can we become incapable of shared experience? </p><p data-line-id="d8a10986a219497f9b4416d322d286f2"> An animal’s perceptual world is determined by the specifics of its senses. For example, a shark uses smell to locate its prey over miles of ocean, sight once the prey is within its field of vision, a sensory organ known as a lateral line to detect movement, and electrical pulses at the very end to guide its attack. Birds can see ultraviolet markings on one another’s feathers that humans cannot, so male and female birds that look identical to us look very different to them. Bats “see” the world through echolocation, while some fish use “electrolocation.” </p>

<p data-line-id="838eb8b51b0c4d629e6ec7578acd9551"> BERLIN – Public opinion about the world today is oddly bifurcated. Big industrial economies, including China, are gripped by a generalized mood of fear and doubt, even though many individuals correctly suspect that they themselves are doing well (it is “everyone else” who is doing terribly). Markets are hitting <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-01-24-2024-0998cc2d">new highs</a> as political and investor sentiment run in opposite directions. Politics is suffused with pessimism, while the economy brims with energy. </p><p data-line-id="e66f27d809404dfba4990abe371d452e"> For the past 30 years, the American political consultant James Carville’s famous mantra, “It’s the economy, stupid,” has shaped our understanding of politics, especially in an election year. But this bit of wisdom is well past its sell-by date. Politics has long since stopped responding to what is happening in the real world, including the economy. </p><p data-line-id="1b502a395d58468d9e2224622f5c6896"> Start with the United States, which seems destined to rerun the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Two old men, four years older than the last time they faced off, will go through the motions again in November. Likewise, France is bracing itself for yet another run at the presidency by the far-right populist Marine Le Pen. </p>

<p data-line-id="a96460ed54fe48e594f672bce7b6e1d0"> MADRID – International media are brimming with pronouncements that the West is in decline. The institutions that have formed the foundation of the rules-based international order since World War II are on the brink of collapse, we are warned, and the principles that underpin our open societies have been eroded. </p><p data-line-id="0393b55d0e4941a4ad061925f3c0644f"> These claims are not baseless, and there is plenty of reason to pay attention to them.

At the very least, we should wait to see what happens over the course of this year, when <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/01/what-to-watch-global-elections-2024-00133027">elections</a> will be held in countries representing half the global population. </p><p data-line-id="6cb4087933de419c83a9bcc70cef7985"> Of the elections that have taken place so far, Taiwan’s recent <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-taiwan-election">presidential</a> and <a href="https://globaltaiwan.org/2024/01/the-outcomes-of-taiwans-2024-legislative-elections/">legislative</a> polls are the most significant. Given the island’s role in the US-China rivalry – which can be understood as a contest between democracy and autocracy – the vote may turn out to be a kind of bellwether. </p>

<p data-line-id="1078360fbc674106b51951759a44f4d3"> BEIJING – The start of 2024 has been marked by a wave of increasingly pessimistic forecasts for China’s economy. While the Chinese government remains optimistic, the International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/11/07/pr23380-imf-staff-completes-2023-article-iv-mission-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china#:~:text=The%20Chinese%20economy%20is%20projected,market%20and%20subdued%20external%20demand.">projects</a> that GDP growth will slow to 4.6% this year, from 5.4% in 2023. Meanwhile, the Chinese stock-market rout is expected to continue after share prices fell to their <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-08/china-stocks-slump-to-5-year-low-as-2024-starts-on-a-dismal-note?sref=4rOwJ71Y">lowest level in five years</a>. </p><p data-line-id="9e96688d822b41929a56130b911f88c5"> But China’s economic prospects are brighter than they appear.

<p data-line-id="4d75d09bba874b91930c5a6c5a942dc1"> CHICAGO/WASHINGTON, DC – The start of 2024 has been marked by a wave of predictions regarding the trajectory of artificial intelligence, ranging from optimistic to cautious. Nevertheless, a clear consensus has emerged: AI is already reshaping human experience. To keep up, humanity must evolve. </p><p data-line-id="03261ae431b14089a42f5485ff9b623a"> For anyone who has lived through the rise of the internet and social media, the AI revolution may evoke a sense of déjà vu – and raise two fundamental questions: Is it possible to maintain the current momentum without repeating the mistakes of the past? And can we create a world in which everyone, including the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR-2023-09-12-universal-and-meaningful-connectivity-by-2030.aspx">2.6 billion people</a> who remain offline, is able to thrive? </p><p data-line-id="eb5cdb78c9764f2391360889cd9eeed9"> Harnessing AI to bring about an equitable and human-centered future requires new, inclusive forms of innovation. But three promising trends offer hope for the year ahead. </p>

<p data-line-id="e70dea4b138b44cb8043318fb628dac9"> LONDON – As the war in Gaza enters its fourth month, many in the Middle East and across the Global South have been struck both by the ferocity of Israel’s military campaign and by Western governments’ unwavering support for it. To them, this is as much US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s war as it is Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s, and the continuing indifference to the scale of the devastation has reaffirmed how cheap Arab lives appear to be to Western leaders. </p><p data-line-id="ccf8ee336807407aa9d630735285d10d"> For those who lived through the Cold War and witnessed how Western powers dealt with post-colonial states and their peoples, recent events are all too familiar. As I argue in my new book, <a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300259575/what-really-went-wrong/"><em>What Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East</em></a>, the United States and other Western countries, mainly the United Kingdom, have for nearly a century pursued an interventionist, militaristic, and anti-democratic foreign policy that largely ignores Middle Eastern peoples’ interests. If anything, Western decisions have been driven historically by the desire to roll back communism and secure the dominance of liberal capitalism. </p><p data-line-id="fb0de0fb204a4ebb8cb1017346e0d55b"> In pursuit of these twin aims, the US offered Middle Eastern leaders a zero-sum choice: either join in Western-led regional defense alliances and open your economy to global capital, or be considered a foe. In the name of maintaining stability and securing an uninterrupted flow of cheap oil, Western powers struck devil’s pacts with Middle Eastern autocrats and actively contributed to the demise of incipient democratic movements. </p>

<p data-line-id="3a351955d66b4ef094d2a36599ec0877"> DUBLIN – On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. To his supporters, it was a day of “<a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/germany-1933-democracy-dictatorship/">national revolution</a>” and rebirth. Germany, they believed, needed the restorative force of an authoritarian strongman after 14 years of the liberal-democratic Weimar “system.” That night, Hitler’s torch-bearing <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/night-hitlers-triumph">brownshirts</a> marched through central Berlin to mark the dawn of a new era. </p><p data-line-id="5335b64dcff64c45bf18f9bd526cade8"> It was also a triumphant moment in the history of popular deception. Since the Weimar Republic’s early days, its politics had been defined by disinformation campaigns, including the lie that Weimar democracy was the work of a cabal of Jews and socialists who had “<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-hitler-used-jews-failed-wwi-era-idealism-to-feed-the-worlds-worst-genocide/">stabbed Germany in the back</a>” to ensure its defeat in World War I. </p><p data-line-id="bc2f91f17c8441f89fc4a6041951be29"> Today, few people dispute that Hitler’s arrival was a turning point in world history, the start of a political process that would lead to World War II and the Holocaust. But Hitler did not “seize power,” as the Nazis later claimed. Instead, as his biographer Ian Kershaw has <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393337617">explained</a>, he was “levered into power” by a small group of influential men. </p>

<p data-line-id="4fe5a494ce754db7af8628456a589d4b"> PARIS – In the vein of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3wNuru4U0I">We Are the World</a>,” the <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/04/26/harry-belafonte-dance-with-fame-fed-a-life-of-activism/">1985 hit</a> that sold more than 20 million copies globally, the song “Lasting Legacy” was released at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai. The official charity anthem features 13 artists from around the world singing about unity, cooperation, and climate action. </p><p data-line-id="c197cc06b35f4981923f6eb5a2b3b20f"> One legacy of COP28 that ought to be commemorated in song is the launch of the Loss and Damage Fund. This new channel for multilateral finance aims to support developing countries that are facing ballooning costs from storms, heatwaves, floods, landslides, wildfires, droughts, sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, and desertification. These adverse effects of global warming are causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage every year. </p><p data-line-id="5a8ecb763fbb46409ab46dabae27dba9"> Currently, however, pledges to the Loss and Damage Fund are well below target. At COP28, donor countries, led by France, Germany, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, promised around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/700m-pledged-to-loss-and-damage-fund-cop28-covers-less-than-02-percent-needed">$700 million</a> – far short of what is needed to meet the challenge. Despite that, the UAE’s commitment is a welcome departure from the widely held view that only those countries with a historic responsibility for climate change should pay for loss and damage. It signals to today’s world that the responsibility for the state of the planet and its climate must be borne by everyone, while underscoring the importance of multilateral cooperation, especially among powerful governments. </p><p data-line-id="af77a1c2b1b7446b884e12bd151fa442"> To be sure, billions of dollars are already being invested in climate-change mitigation and adaptation through the multilateral system. Nearly all international financing institutions have facilities devoted to this end. The International Monetary Fund, for example, has its Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which received at least <a href="https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2023/12/what-is-the-imf-resilience-and-sustainability-trust/">$41.1 billion</a> in pledges as of November 2023. Meanwhile, the UN has several, including the Central Emergency Response Fund, which spent around <a href="https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/afghanistan/ocha-managed-pooled-funds-and-loss-damage-ochas-crucial-role-evolving-space-july-5-2023">$2.2 billion</a> between 2006 and 2022 on efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, and <a href="https://www.unocha.org/country-based-pooled-funds">Country-Based Pooled Funds</a>. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Synthesis Report on Loss and Damage (which one of us co-authored) identified some 45 funding windows dedicated to disaster preparedness, with 13 more focused on emergency response. </p><p data-line-id="c5af6a2be3fb4d22be99d4eaaf3a0643"> This raises the question of where the Loss and Damage Fund fits in this crowded and complex terrain. Certainly, there is still a great need for financing: significant gaps remain, and the lack of grant funding, especially for recovery and reconstruction, is particularly worrisome. It will also be crucial to expand climate-risk insurance coverage and facilitate debt swaps (and deferrals) to create more fiscal space amid surging global interest rates. On the other hand, the new fund risks becoming another vain attempt to mend a multilateral system that is outdated and unfit for purpose – especially if it is underfunded. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="564a8a60a85c47e991c1b2137280f4c1"> To avoid that outcome, the Loss and Damage Fund should move away from a project-based model that involves doling out small amounts of money. Given the scale of the challenge and the intensity of people’s suffering, the Fund should instead embrace structural and policy innovations that would help establish a new generation of multilateral organizations. The <a href="https://pactedeparis.org/en.php">Summit for a New Global Financing Pact</a>, convened by French President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> last year, and the Bridgetown Initiative led by Barbadian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/mia-amor-mottley">Mia Amor Mottley</a> provide many starting points and proposals for redesigning the global financial system. </p><p data-line-id="22dd4f20582a4dec8160e1315a6e5480"> More specifically, the Loss and Damage Fund could create a new template for countries to mobilize domestic resources for climate mitigation and adaption more effectively, and to access global financial markets and multilateral lending at fair terms, as well as different forms of debt relief. The Fund could also design a global insurance scheme for the most vulnerable households and small and medium-size businesses. </p><p data-line-id="67d289bb25f54010bc7f861952d52307"> In today’s fragmented world, the Loss and Damage Fund could easily be derailed. But it is in our common interest to assist the most climate-vulnerable countries with recovery and reconstruction in a way that does not compromise development gains achieved over past decades. Providing these countries with enough resources, financial and otherwise, would ensure stability for us all. </p>

<p data-line-id="b65b73d70fc943baa475a9623a910688"> NEW YORK – On January 22, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-counts-down-opening-grand-ram-temple-ayodhya-2024-01-22/">consecrated</a> the Ram Mandir, a vast new Hindu temple in Ayodhya. Cast as “the high priest of Hinduism,” in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/hindu-temple-ayodhya-india-modi/">words of his biographer</a>, Modi gave offerings and blessings to an idol of Lord Ram, one of the most revered Hindu deities, who was supposedly born on this sacred spot. The temple is also a powerful political symbol for Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party: it was built on the ruins of a sixteenth-century mosque that Hindu-nationalist mobs, egged on by BJP leaders, demolished in 1992, sparking sectarian riots that left <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report">2,000 people dead</a>. </p><p data-line-id="a67be3baf01d403c83de07b850385df8"> Modi promises to create a “new India,” by which he means a Hindu India, where the country’s more than 200 million Muslims will be seen as interlopers. In fact, this deliberate mixing of religion and politics is unconstitutional in India. Independent India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as the political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, recognized how explosive religious strife could be in a multi-faith and multi-ethnic society, which is why they insisted that India be a secular state. </p><p data-line-id="8664b745d0fc4f67b5c1aae079593029"> The desire to undermine the secular state long precedes Modi. The man who murdered Mahatma Gandhi was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary Hindu nationalist organization with ties to the BJP that played a major role in the razing of the mosque in Ayodhya. In 1986, Hindu agitators seized upon then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s misguided decision to give into Muslim demands to permit Islamic law to override a Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of Muslim divorcées to receive alimony beyond 90 days. Using this exception to whip up smoldering Hindu resentments, these agitators pushed Hindu nationalism from the margins to the center of Indian politics. </p>

<p data-line-id="2ad0e9928c96415cbcb2a6fd0e9c1065"> NEW HAVEN – China is at a critical juncture. Its deflation-prone debt-intensive economy is seriously underperforming. Its government has become embroiled in a major superpower conflict with the United States. And it is staring down the barrel of a demographic crisis. Worst of all, Chinese authorities are responding to these challenges more with ideology and stale tactics from the past, rather than with breakthrough reforms.

My Yale course, “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-china-risks-and-opportunities-by-stephen-s--roach-2017-05?barrier=accesspaylog">The Next China</a>,” made the case for a powerful shift in the Chinese growth model, from an investment- and export-led economy to one driven by domestic consumption. </p><p data-line-id="7474eff6a1d5410b9d576e798cadc825"> Yes, I worried that China’s porous social safety net – both for retirement and health care – could lead to a rise in fear-driven precautionary saving that would inhibit consumer demand. But, viewing these concerns more as challenges than risks, I remained convinced that China would ultimately rebalance its economy. </p>

<p data-line-id="0063279a1ee94774aa034ae6391ea3c7"> DAVOS – This year’s World Economic Forum in Davos was even more exhausting and bewildering than usual. Politicians love to say that you should never let a crisis go to waste, but even they seemed overwhelmed by a conference agenda that aimed to capture the full sweep of today’s “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/can-democracy-survive-polycrisis-artificial-intelligence-climate-change-ukraine-war-by-george-soros-2023-06">polycrisis</a>.” </p><p data-line-id="0be1eb8d921e4ced9d6bd5d0717cd76e"> The issue is not just that individual problems become more difficult to solve when there are many of them at once. It is that today’s crises are increasingly feeding one another <em>and </em>competing with one another for attention. Against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and the escalating conflict in the Middle East, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-houthi-attacks-red-sea-threaten-global-shipping">Houthi attacks</a> on shipping in the Red Sea have become a source of unease across the global economy. Making matters worse, drought conditions in Central America – a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/24/red-sea-panama-canal-climate-supply-chains">byproduct</a> of both cyclical weather patterns and the longer-run effects of climate change – have simultaneously curtailed shipping through the Panama Canal. </p><p data-line-id="c8fd97effdb1402b8c8468f504e53e80"> In Gaza, the humanitarian consequences of the war have worsened by the day, with the Palestinian death toll now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-01-21-2024-02caafa092668ecc7ff122229c166807">exceeding 25,000</a>. On panel after panel at Davos, US officials and assorted European and Arab diplomats outlined their visions for stopping the war through regional integration and a <a href="https://turkiye.un.org/en/258094-gaza-crisis-back-two-state-solution-urges-un-chief-%E2%80%98once-and-all%E2%80%99">two-state solution</a>. </p>

<p data-line-id="507cf5a1c1a24552a37d610b48dcfc58"> SINGAPORE – The global economic landscape is changing fast. Scarring from the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened potential growth, making slower income gains the new normal for many countries. Geopolitical tensions – especially the trade and technology “war” between the United States and China – are threatening not only to halt globalization, a key enabler of growth over the last few decades, but also to split the world economy into separate blocs. And the days of low and stable inflation seem to be giving way to structurally higher and more volatile prices. </p><p data-line-id="83083c9ef6db4d43a95c3f89628b0387"> Meanwhile, rapid digitalization – propelled partly by advanced technologies like generative artificial intelligence – is continuing apace, and the effects of climate change are becoming more visible by the day. Taken together, these developments pose major challenges to policymakers worldwide. Those in the ASEAN+3 countries – the ten ASEAN member states, plus China, Japan, and South Korea – are no exception. </p><p data-line-id="1c4f30b479e64e4d8cf97a0b825e02c1"> During the pandemic, ASEAN+3 governments went all in to support their economies, not least by monetizing fiscal deficits – a taboo in normal times. The unprecedented fiscal stimulus they pursued – including large amounts of direct assistance to households and firms, from cash handouts to fuel subsidies – was accompanied by large interest-rate cuts. For example, in the Philippines, cumulative cuts in the policy rate reached <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/SitePages/MediaAndResearch/SpeechesDisp.aspx?ItemId=891">200 basis points in 2020</a>. Governments also pursued policies like debt moratoria and regulatory forbearance. </p>

<p data-line-id="f7654d7819e44595be68824e194894c5"> NEW HAVEN/STANFORD – Last November, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s closely watched criminal trial ended with his conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. According to the prosecution, Bankman-Fried stole “billions of dollars” from the crypto exchange’s customers “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/sam-bankman-fried-will-not-face-second-trial-us-prosecutors-say-2023-12-29/#:~:text=Jurors%20on%20Nov.%202%20convicted,customers%20out%20of%20sheer%20greed.">out of sheer greed</a>.” </p><p data-line-id="d5c50454b4a541499947c35c120a3cc0"> One key issue was how much money FTX’s customers lost. During the trial, the prosecution and its witnesses repeatedly – in fact, 97 times – put that number at $8 billion. Although no proof to substantiate this massive figure was ever offered, the prosecution clearly wanted it to stay in jury members’ heads. </p><p data-line-id="c30cc4cdfa414052be704a2ca79b8ce5"> In fact, the figure is misleading. Instead of measuring loss, the $8 billion reflects the temporary shortfall in cash and other liquid assets needed to cover FTX customers’ remaining redemption requests after FTX’s chief competitor triggered a run on the exchange in November 2022. </p>

The arrogance, megalomania, and lack of imagination of the PiS leadership is in full view again. PiS had a very good electoral result – over 35% of the vote. After what they did while in power, they shouldn’t have had a fifth of those votes. But the result of this election is transparent – they got a red card. They were unable to form a government.  </p><p data-line-id="136c4c445fc947249c30754cde6819a9"> Yet this is just the beginning of the ride, because PiS will try to rock the boat as much as possible in an effort to overturn the new government. Now everything depends on the extent to which the new government can change Poland and attract some of the PiS electorate.

Back then, the regime was collapsing; it was a constitutional, historical moment. The dictatorship was headed by people who knew that the project of socialism or communism had lost. They wondered how to find a place for themselves in the new reality and were ready to respect the rules of the game. </p>

<p data-line-id="c794fc0dc019451aa69a21670452e1e5"> CAMBRIDGE – Observing Republican members of Congress oppose the extension of US support to Ukraine, one cannot help but wonder what happened to one of the United States’ two major political parties. This includes those GOP politicians who, while ostensibly supportive of Ukraine, allow their colleagues to hold it hostage to unrelated concerns about the US-Mexico border. Given the dire consequences of a potential Russian triumph in Ukraine, it is abundantly clear that supporting the Ukrainian war effort should be a top foreign-policy priority. But some in Congress evidently need a reminder of some basic history. </p><p data-line-id="ba6fd42d945644d8b38a640f18b48af9"> In 1916, US President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected with the slogan, “He kept us out of war,” in reference to World War I. This was in line with a tradition, dating back to the US founding, of avoiding what Thomas Jefferson called “entangling alliances.” As John Quincy Adams <a href="https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1821secofstateJQAdmas.pdf">famously put it</a> in 1821, the US does not go “abroad in search of monsters to destroy.” </p><p data-line-id="1c6d4074264c4d938376b22472b87d48"> Nevertheless, the US entered WWI in 1917, largely owing to Germany’s resumption of submarine attacks on neutral vessels, which had resulted in the loss of American lives. The arrival of US forces in Europe played a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power, enabling the Allies to defeat Germany and leading to the armistice on November 11, 1918. </p>

<p data-line-id="3c79500ffdb04e0d81f9a132bd8db0e9"> NEW YORK – Casual observers of the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) can be forgiven for attributing high stakes to the event. “We are on the brink of a climate disaster, and this conference must mark a turning point,” UN Chief <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1733937291528147148">warned</a> during the proceedings. Then, when a final agreement was reached, Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/reaction-uns-final-proposal-cop28-deal-2023-12-13/">hailed</a> its “breakthrough commitments on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and the transition away from fossil fuels.” </p>
<p data-line-id="bcbae13248144fb6af398de03b2fe3f4"> But the truth is that neither the contents of the <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/news/2023/12/COP28-delivers-historic-consensus-in-Dubai-to-accelerate-climate-action">Dubai agreement</a>, nor what was left out of it, will have much impact on climate change. We have seen this movie many times before, starting with the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-convention/history-of-the-convention">1992 treaty</a> that created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Back then, all countries committed to preventing “dangerous” climate change, which would have required dramatic cuts in annual global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. But emissions have continued to rise, albeit at a lower rate than they might have otherwise. Voluntary commitments have proven mostly hollow. </p>
<p data-line-id="e6afbfc5c7b841f1a61475d3871c0a61"> To be clear, we are not suggesting that fevered warnings about climate risks and the need for action are misguided. As economists who have spent decades studying climate change, we recognize that some of the economics literature has too often been used by those opposing a meaningful response. As we note in a recent <a href="https://igp.sipa.columbia.edu/sites/igp/files/2023-12/How-Economics-Can-Tackle-the-Wicked-problem-of-Climate-Change.pdf">report</a> for the Institute of Global Politics, economic models that purport to identify “optimal” climate policies often <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1350178X.2022.2040740">systematically</a> underestimate the benefits of emissions reductions and overestimate their costs. </p>
<p data-line-id="6030c9239c30479e8881068ab0e89f52"> Moreover, economists have let their admiration for a single policy solution, carbon taxes, get the better of them. This has given rise to <a href="https://www.econstatement.org/">misleading claims</a> that relying on carbon prices alone is the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions. In fact, the many market failures that stand in the way of a rapid, equitable transition to net-zero emissions underscore the need for a broad portfolio of policies (which includes carbon prices). </p>
<p data-line-id="01471152f66d4e84a868807fcb3200af"> In a world of urgent challenges, policymakers and the public have limited attention for climate change. Rather than focusing so much on international conferences that require unanimous support, entail no accountability, and ultimately have little effect on emissions, we should be directing our energies toward negotiating agreements that can achieve transformational progress in narrow, but crucial, economic sectors. </p>
<p data-line-id="5bea136f8ef840c1a5d698e7568a6772"> We already know that this more targeted approach works. Consider the <a href="https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-environmental-quality-and-transboundary-issues/the-montreal-protocol-on-substances-that-deplete-the-ozone-layer/#:~:text=The%20Montreal%20Protocol%2C%20finalized%20in,%2C%20fire%20extinguishers%2C%20and%20aerosols.">Montreal Protocol</a>, which protects the stratospheric ozone layer, or the <a href="https://www.imo.org/en/about/Conventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Prevention-of-Pollution-from-Ships-(MARPOL).aspx">International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships</a> (MARPOL). Unlike the voluntary commitments made at each climate-change COP, these two treaties established binding obligations that can be enforced through international trade markets. The Montreal Protocol bars participating countries from trading in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/ozone-depleting-substances">chlorofluorocarbons</a> (ozone-depleting chemicals) with non-participating countries; and under MARPOL, <a href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/garbage-default.aspx">access to ports</a> is restricted to ships that meet certain technical standards. </p>
<p data-line-id="d5efc214c3c84d7ebc19201e47809198"> These two treaties have worked because they create positive feedback effects: the more countries that agree to participate, the higher the pressure on others to join. As a result, the ozone layer will return to its <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/ozone-layer-recovery-track-helping-avoid-global-warming-05degc#:~:text=On%20track%20to%20full%20recovery&amp;text=If%20current%20policies%20remain%20in,the%20rest%20of%20the%20world.">pre-1980 level</a> in a few decades, and over <a href="https://namepa.net/international-convention-for-the-prevention-of-pollution-from-ships/">99%</a> of oil is now shipped according to MARPOL specifications, virtually eliminating a major source of marine pollution. </p>
<p data-line-id="677f50c49b5f4abbbfb1fbf5dd5d45a4"> The same approach has already worked for climate agreements. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/recent-international-developments-under-montreal-protocol#:~:text=On%20October%2015%2C%202016%2C%20with,over%20the%20next%2030%20years.">Kigali Amendment</a> to the Montreal Protocol phases down hydrofluorocarbons, a powerful greenhouse gas. Like the examples above, the amendment incorporates a trade measure designed to create a positive feedback effect once a critical threshold of participation has been met. Owing to this structure, ratification is in every country’s interest. Even in polarized America, it received <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-ratification-of-the-kigali-amendment/">strong bipartisan support</a> in the US Senate last year. </p>
<p data-line-id="08321bacc1d14da9af4cce16cc115899"> We should now do the same for other major emissions sources. Aluminum production, for example, is responsible for <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/aluminum-decarbonization-at-a-cost-that-makes-sense">about 2%</a> of global GHG emissions each year. Yet by replacing carbon anodes with inert anodes, the industry could dramatically reduce its emissions. An aluminum treaty might require that parties both switch to inert anodes and import aluminum only from other participating parties. </p>
<p data-line-id="9dc60ffec2c745e6b4264d81d9bb577a"> In contrast to unilateral threats of trade measures, this approach to international climate agreements is fundamentally cooperative and multilateral. It differs from unilaterally imposing domestic regulations on foreign production, as the European Union <a href="https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en">is doing</a>, or from imposing carbon-based tariffs on certain imports without any corresponding domestic regulations, as some in the US have <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/tariff-climate-pollution-environment">proposed</a>. These methods may only invite retaliation. </p>
<p data-line-id="055a77c796f14587a24d42fab828e1c5"> To succeed, international climate agreements must be compatible with countries’ economic strategies, not least those of lower-income countries like India, where most future emissions will occur. That is why the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment include <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/news/kigali-amendment-montreal-protocol-another-global-commitment-stop-climate">provisions</a> whereby richer countries agree to help poorer countries pay the costs of compliance. </p>
<p data-line-id="f41096966c654318848d6fc5a2c03c2a"> The international community took the wrong lesson from the <a href="https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>. It should be obvious by now that relying on voluntary commitments and aspirational targets does not work. The problem with Kyoto was that it did not get the <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/articles/success-or-failure-the-kyoto-protocols-troubled-legacy/">incentives</a> right. </p>
<p data-line-id="9bcd7445283b4574927f93f350d9b841"> By focusing climate agreements on individual sectors, linking obligations to trade access, and addressing the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20309647#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20international,should%20take%20the%20lead%20and">common but differentiated</a>” roles of rich and poor countries in international negotiations, the world will have a better chance to achieve the goals outlined in the Dubai agreement: a rapid and equitable transition to net-zero emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="773f3636ac944577ba581c9a87dd7eba"> Then, future climate-change COPs can focus on other consequential issues, rather than on crafting the right mix of hollow words that everyone can agree on. </p>

<p data-line-id="1d64e105aed14cd883813e4d6ebaf2b8"> SAN DIEGO – In the early 1990s, every self-respecting American yuppie and retired suburban couple bought an electric bread maker, with sales hitting <a href="https://www.mcall.com/1993/12/08/rapid-rise-for-bread-machines-home-bakers-overjoyed-with-hi-tech-appliances/">four million units</a>.<strong> </strong>But the fad soon faded as these amateur bakers discovered that stuffing a precise quantity and ratio of flour, eggs, butter, yeast, and salt into a metal box takes time and costs much more than strolling to the corner bakery. Are plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) the bread makers of our day? </p><p data-line-id="3bc2f5e98a964d14a5edb40b8c5a90f8"> Despite Tesla founder Elon Musk’s entrepreneurial brilliance and billions of dollars in government subsidies to support EVs, it appears that consumers still prefer to drive to a gas station for a five-minute fill-up than to retrofit their garage and suffer the range anxiety that comes from hunting for a charging station in the parking lot of an abandoned shopping mall. J.D. Power reports that <a href="https://www.governing.com/climate/why-do-so-many-ev-chargers-across-the-nation-not-work">21%</a> of public chargers do not work in any case. As consumers start to shy away from EVs, their choice will affect not just the car industry, but US-China relations, state budgets, and commodity prices. </p><p data-line-id="0b3a4f65c3934ccbb84dab6a03075966"> The evidence is rolling in fast. This month, Hertz, which purchased 100,000 Teslas to great fanfare in 2021, executed a squealing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/14/hertz-makes-agile-decision-to-shift-strategy-and-sell-evs-teslas.html">180-degree turn</a> and began dumping one-third of its EV fleet, taking a $245 million charge against its earnings. Its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-20/hertz-to-buy-175-000-electric-vehicles-from-gm-over-five-years">pledge</a> to buy 175,000 EVs from GM will likely go up in smoke, too. Outside of wealthy, trendy communities, consumers are <a href="https://money.com/why-americans-not-buying-electric-cars/">walking past</a> plug-in EVs and snapping up hybrids and gasoline-powered engines instead. </p>

</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="063a8ed5ad6246498c0e59ec2a540abc"> WASHINGTON, DC/PARIS – If developing economies found it hard to manage their debts in 2023, they are likely to face even more formidable challenges this year. Though most possess relatively small debt stocks and are not considered insolvent, many are in dire need of liquidity. As long as this remains true, they will struggle not only to manage their debts, but also to invest in the green transition. </p>
<p data-line-id="a17550f8e2a740d388ba120211b9f894"> Developing economies have faced a series of external shocks in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, war-related disruptions of food and energy supply chains, and an uptick in global inflation. Moreover, their <a href="https://findevlab.org/closing-the-spigots-the-rise-and-collapse-of-bond-markets-for-developing-countries/">access to capital markets</a> has been curtailed, preventing them from rolling over maturing loans, as they would do in normal times. As a result, countries have been forced to channel a large share of their tax and export revenues to service their debt, avoiding default at the cost of priorities like infrastructure investment, social-welfare programs, and climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="ddcdcb3080ea449fbbf7027d68b816c1"> The outlook for these countries is likely to worsen in the next few years. According to <a href="https://findevlab.org/mapping-debt-vulnerabilities-an-update/">estimates</a> by the Finance for Development Lab (FDL), large debt payments are coming due in 2024 and 2026 for at least 20 low- and lower-middle-income countries. As countries hit this “debt wall,” their already fragile fiscal positions will deteriorate further. This does not bode well for climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="67e4deae26db4f8bb4cc88c2da7b2277"> Climate change is not some distant menace; its effects are already being felt worldwide, especially in climate-vulnerable developing economies. But international summits on the topic last year sent a disappointing message: while developed economies pledged to increase climate financing by 2030, developing-economy policymakers are struggling against severe fiscal constraints. With medium-term strategies being used to address a short-term threat, developing and emerging economies have been <a href="https://findevlab.org/from-the-summit-to-camp-base-what-happened-in-paris/">expressing frustration</a>, including at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact that was held in Paris last June. </p>
<p data-line-id="d39146c574a64f3cac9d610c8b4d3130"> Multilateral development banks can provide an <a href="https://icrier.org/g20-ieg/pdf/The_Triple_Agenda_G20-IEG_Report_Volume2_2023.pdf">essential lifeline</a>, but their capacity would have to be strengthened – and quickly. According to World Bank <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/02225002-395f-464a-8e13-2acfca05e8f0">data</a>, the new concessional loans the world’s poorest countries received from MDBs in 2022 were smaller than these countries’ debt-service payments, a large share of which went to private and bilateral creditors. Increasing capital flight from the developing world – driven not least by monetary tightening in advanced economies – will intensify the needs of illiquid lower-income countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="1ca9ba05b2e64bcdb594b0bc9835b249"> But it is not only a matter of financial capacity. MDBs have so far been inconsistent, at best, when it comes to supporting countries struggling to repay their debts. For example, both <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/05/kenyas-debt-struggles-go-far-deeper-chinese-loans">Kenya</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopia-getting-debt-relief-china-asking-others-similar-imf-official-2023-10-13/">Ethiopia</a> have been under pressure to repay their private and Chinese creditors, which are now collecting more in debt-service payments than they are providing in new loans. But only Kenya received <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/world-bank-sees-12-billion-support-kenya-over-next-3-years-2023-11-20/">enough support</a> from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others to refinance its debt that is maturing this year. </p>
<p data-line-id="33ed5b0b41124d5d811c368fb6963aed"> By contrast, assistance to Ethiopia has declined in recent years. As a result, Ethiopia recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopia-becomes-africas-latest-sovereign-default-2023-12-26/">defaulted</a> on its external debt, even though it amounts to just <a href="https://african.business/2024/01/finance-services/what-does-2024-hold-for-ethiopia-after-its-2023-default">25% of GDP</a>. While the Kenya approach is not the solution – providing similar levels of support to all illiquid countries would require a tripling of MDB flows – this is clearly unacceptable. </p>
<p data-line-id="845889ab897346e194fa6f1004786b7f"> A better approach would focus on closing the gap between short-term debt concerns and long-term investment needs, by unlocking net-positive inflows for countries facing liquidity constraints. As the FDL has <a href="https://findevlab.org/a-bridge-to-climate-action/">proposed</a>, an <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/low-middle-income-countries-debt-development-climate-crisis-by-dani-rodrik-and-ishac-diwan-2023-09">agreement</a> among debtors, creditors, and MDBs to permit countries to reschedule debts coming due – delaying maturities by 5-10 years – would create fiscal space for climate-friendly investments, financed by MDBs. </p>
<p data-line-id="3ac32ab754c1425a9a64a0a329a780b0"> For this liquidity bridge to work, MDBs would have to accelerate progress on implementing existing reform plans and increase funding substantially, while the IMF helps manage debt-rollover risks. Importantly, private and bilateral creditors would have to agree to the rescheduling. That is why, compared to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/debt/brief/debt-service-suspension-initiative-qas">Debt Service Suspension Initiative</a> that the G20 introduced in 2020, the proposal includes stronger incentives for private-sector creditors to participate, in addition to longer time horizons. </p>
<p data-line-id="c1067e8901df485a86a24cd24a815fa0"> There are good reasons to believe that creditors can be convinced to join the program voluntarily. It is, after all, in their best interest to remain invested in solvent countries with strong growth prospects; no one benefits from debt crises like those that have ensnared <a href="https://iea-world.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IEA-Lessons-from-SL-and-Zambia-Summary-v2.pdf">Zambia and Sri Lanka</a>. In any case, creditors would continue receiving interest payments, and as global interest rates fall and economic-growth prospects improve in the coming years, debtors may well be able to return to capital markets and resume repayment of the principal. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9d37ed3c7864273aafadec01f94b6a0"> Shaping a workable blueprint along these lines is a task for upcoming international gatherings, such as the <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/events/g20-brazil-summit-2024/">G20 summit</a> in Brazil later this year. Logistical and financial coordination will be needed to ensure sufficient liquidity. Coordination among the IMF, the World Bank, and regional development banks will also be essential to ensure that participating debtor countries pursue investments that genuinely support green growth. </p>
<p data-line-id="10e878b96ab5456da855e37c87e04c04"> If nothing is done to help countries facing liquidity crises, the world will risk a wave of destabilizing debt defaults, and progress on the green transition will be severely undermined, with catastrophic implications for the entire world. Because promising solutions like the liquidity bridge can prevent such outcomes, they deserve broad global support. </p>

<p data-line-id="a69ec2fa693d47bbafda94f72a7548ac"> SÃO PAULO – It hasn’t taken long for Argentina’s newly installed president, Javier Milei, to demonstrate the lunacy of a radical libertarian approach to foreign policy. At this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Milei raised from the dead the issue of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/david-cameron-argentina-world-economic-forum-davos-south-atlantic-b2480176.html">Falkland Islands’ sovereignty</a> with UK Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/david-cameron-1">David Cameron</a>, who promptly swatted away any discussion about the islands’ future. At a time when Milei needs to revive Argentina’s moribund economy, evoking the Argentine military junta that launched the Falklands War in 1982 seems unhinged. </p><p data-line-id="9701ce922a8140d1b32d63483d97854d"> More ominously still, Milei has picked a fight with China, one of the country’s main trading partners. In late December, a lawmaker from Milei’s party <a href="https://buenosairesherald.com/world/international-relations/argentina-and-china-hold-bilateral-meeting-amid-tensions">met with</a> representatives of Taiwan’s trade office in Argentina. Soon after, local media outlets <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-01-15/a-month-of-milei.html">reported</a> a meeting between Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino and Miao-hung Hsie, Taiwan’s representative in Buenos Aires. </p><p data-line-id="bdf6c9c437b84a6fb57aba77f1e64af1"> This show of support for Taiwan suggests that Milei may hold true to his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china-says-would-be-serious-mistake-if-argentina-cuts-ties-2023-11-21/">campaign promise</a> to sever ties with China. His harsh criticism of <a href="https://buenosairesherald.com/politics/tucker-carlson-interviews-javier-milei-for-x-twitter-series">“communist” countries</a> in the run-up to the presidential election raised serious concerns about the future of Sino-Argentine relations, especially because Argentina relies heavily on a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/china-clears-65-bln-part-argentina-swap-line-deal-2023-10-18/">currency-swap agreement</a> with China to finance imports and pay off debt maturities. Soon after Milei was sworn in as president, China <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3245805/china-reportedly-suspends-us65-billion-currency-swap-agreement-argentina">reportedly suspended</a> this agreement, hindering Argentina’s ability to meet its financial obligations. </p>

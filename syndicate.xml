<p data-line-id="9d5c9c6742794630a9893390f7a1d2a1"> BERKELEY – The <em>Washington Post</em>’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” is sadly coming true in many parts of the United States. The digital age has shattered newspapers’ business model, turning many communities into “<a href="https://www.cislm.org/research/u-s-news-deserts/">news deserts</a>” with no local journalism. Some 2,500 daily or weekly newspapers have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/06/29/news-deserts-newspapers-democracy/">folded</a> since 2005, and there are now fewer than 6,500 left. Every week, two more disappear. </p>
<p data-line-id="901d836dca2b4f46b4a2fc8675992ce8"> The decline of local journalism is driven by many factors, but economic challenges top the list. Earlier in the internet era, Craigslist <a href="https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/internet/15500/">supplanted</a> the classified ads that previously funded newspaper journalism. Then came the big digital platforms, which put the final nails in the coffin of the traditional advertising model. Starved of revenue, local news outlets have had to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/10/media-layoffs-cnn-buzzfeed-gannett-recount-protocol">lay off</a> staff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/news-deserts-future.html">reduce</a> coverage areas, or shut down altogether. </p>
<p data-line-id="a9d0f3b74fed4024a2b9bce6e8b31556"> According to Pew Research, the number of local newsroom employees in the US fell by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/">57%</a> between 2008 and 2020, resulting in thousands of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/local-news-investment-economic-value/674942/">ghost newspapers</a>” that barely cover their own communities. Small local newspapers simply do not have the scale to compete against digital advertising giants like Google and Facebook. </p>
<p data-line-id="7ab9fa32d73d4e0182c6816915d935e3"> Media industry consolidation has also played a role in the decline of local journalism. In recent years, many smaller newspapers have become part of <a href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/bigger-and-bigger-they-grow/">larger conglomerates</a> that are focused wholly on profits, usually at the expense of local reporting. As a result, news coverage has been homogenized, and coverage of local issues has suffered, with editorial decisions being made at the corporate level rather than by journalists on the ground. </p>
<p data-line-id="f1bb49749a64453ba41c7ef71d52c082"> It should go without saying that local journalism is vital for informing citizens about government decision-making, community events, and the local issues that will most directly affect them. The traditional local newspaper served as a watchdog, holding local officials accountable and facilitating public engagement. Without local journalism, citizens become less informed, and corruption becomes more likely, leading to a <a href="https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/research-on-local-news/">decline in voter turnout</a> and erosion of democratic institutions. Worse, the absence of credible information <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1078087419838058">allows</a> for the proliferation of misinformation, rumors, and outlandish conspiracy theories, further undermining trust in the democratic process. </p>
<p data-line-id="c3006ddf9ef64bd1a45d94179f01742d"> The decline of local journalism has also contributed to political polarization more broadly. As local newspapers diminish in number and influence, citizens increasingly rely on national news outlets, which tend to be more partisan. Without local outlets offering neutral and balanced reporting, citizens are pulled into echo chambers, consuming only media that align with their preexisting beliefs. The creation of “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/554824-study-decline-in-local-journalism-increases-political-polarization/#:~:text=The%20death%20of%20local%20newspapers,and%20French%20university%20Sciences%20Po.">filter bubbles</a>” by social-media algorithms means that the electorate increasingly lacks a foundation of shared facts and information. As news consumers become less exposed to competing points of view, polarization deepens. </p>
<p data-line-id="3cd0d9f71b9f4ec48977c55d79fcf09b"> But it doesn’t have to be this way. Nonprofit news organizations, community-supported journalism, and membership-based models have emerged as potential alternatives to the traditional advertising-driven approach. Most of these models rely on community engagement and philanthropic support, and new entrants have already become essential for local journalism in many areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="861a5f1d21244e878ef6c406725a957e"> For example, in the space of less than a decade, the nonprofit <a href="https://calmatters.org/about/">CalMatters</a> has increased its staff of journalists covering California state politics and other issues to 40, providing crucial information and accountability for the world’s <a href="https://bulloakcapital.com/blog/if-california-were-a-country/#:~:text=California's%20GDP%20in%202022%20was,India%20and%20the%20United%20Kingdom.">fifth-largest economy</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="c8f2db62d2b04d7385cfbcb1cb1678fb"> Moreover, many community foundations <a href="https://lccf.org/community-foundation-spotlight/local-journalism/">have become homes</a> for journalistic fundraising and, in some cases, for journalists, too. Larger foundations are supporting journalists who cover their areas of interest, from climate change and education to inequality. Over the past decade, philanthropic spending on journalism in the US has nearly <a href="https://givingcompass.org/partners/democracy-and-philanthropy/funding-journalism">quadrupled</a>, to over $250 million per year. TheGuardian.org alone has more than a <a href="https://theguardian.org/about-us-2/">dozen funders</a> providing at least $500,000 per year. </p>
<p data-line-id="9d87e56a80f64469a915b5802b29240c"> But much more is needed. Steve Waldman, the president of Rebuild Local News and a co-founder of Report for America, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/local-news-investment-economic-value/674942/">estimates</a> that it will cost $1.5 billion per year to restore local journalism (by employing roughly 25,000 reporters on salaries of $60,000 per year). While substantial, that is equal to a mere 0.02% of <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/">federal-government spending</a> – or less than 50 cents per American per month. For comparison, there are <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/02/17/college-endowments-dropped-fiscal-year-2022#:~:text=Of%20the%20678%20institutions%20that,reported%20assets%20over%20%241%20billion.">nearly 700</a> higher-education institutions in the US with endowments over $1 billion. </p>
<p data-line-id="a417c2af7af3413bb130ea247feba839"> Broader public funding is likely necessary to fill this financing gap. The US government currently spends a mere <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/01/do-countries-with-better-funded-public-media-also-have-healthier-democracies-of-course-they-do/">$3.16 per person</a> on public media, most of which goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to support local public television and radio stations. A country like Germany, meanwhile, <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/state-public-funding-local-news/#:~:text=It%20would%20have%20supported%20local,them%20hire%20and%20keep%20staff.">spends</a> more than $142 per capita on public media. </p>
<p data-line-id="d72f50a061cf4338962a9e384465f141"> Some states and local governments have already been providing additional funding. For example, New Jersey’s Civic Information Consortium <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/inaugural-series-grants-new-jersey-consortium-provides-journalism-funding-model">funds</a> 14 separate local news organizations; the New Mexico Local News Fund <a href="https://www.nmlocalnews.org/mission/">supports</a> 16 journalists across the state; and a recent $25 million budget appropriation in California will support 39 journalism <a href="https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/">fellows</a>, with a “focus on underserved communities.” Similarly, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/HD1518">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dianenynpa/status/1618335701371846656">New York</a>, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1217">Virginia</a>, <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/related/proposals/ab762">Wisconsin</a><u>,</u> and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/a-new-effort-to-help-save-local-news-from-wa-ag-bob-ferguson/">Washington</a> are all considering tax credits for local-media <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/state-public-funding-local-news/#:~:text=It%20would%20have%20supported%20local,them%20hire%20and%20keep%20staff">subscriptions</a> and payrolls. Other states are directing some of their public advertising budgets toward supporting local media outlets in underprivileged communities. </p>
<p data-line-id="4af9ee92e26341d2b6b7eb3b38858ea6"> Other bold solutions have been considered, but have stalled. At the federal level, the Local Journalism Sustainability Act would have allocated <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/state-public-funding-local-news/#:~:text=It%20would%20have%20supported%20local,them%20hire%20and%20keep%20staff.">$1 billion</a> for tax credits supporting local journalism, but it died along with the Build Back Better bill. Similarly, California’s <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB886">Journalism Preservation Act</a> has been put on hold. If enacted, it would direct digital advertising giants to pay news outlets a “journalism usage fee” when they sell advertising alongside news content, and it would <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-07-07/california-journalism-bill-on-hold-until-2024">require</a> publishers to invest 70% of those funds in preserving journalism jobs in California.  </p>
<p data-line-id="56081a4710454fa4b48eec0bee413ba3"> Such measures may prove indispensable. Local journalism plays a vital role in protecting democracy. But to protect both, we urgently need more business innovation, philanthropic investment, and public support for independent media. </p>

<p data-line-id="3205d0956fb44e70a776db30763af145"> GENEVA – At the upcoming second United Nations High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage, the world’s governments are expected to adopt a new set of commitments focused on accelerating implementation of UHC. No resolution will be complete without the explicit inclusion of comprehensive cancer services. </p><p data-line-id="4d47454d1b634aaebbfe81ed1785123e"> Cancer causes an estimated <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">ten million deaths</a> each year. Beyond the human suffering, the disease has profound – and growing – economic consequences: by 2030, spending on cancer care worldwide is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/167488/precision-medicine-help-deliver-high-quality/">projected</a> to reach $458 billion. In many countries, patients have to pay for much of their cancer care out of pocket – a burden that often leads to <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0433-1">financial catastrophe</a>. </p><p data-line-id="2fe4d6135b934a258be9259a509eab77"> Given this, investing in cost-effective prevention and early-detection strategies is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic one. Prevention is far cheaper than treatment, and where cancer cannot be prevented, early detection makes successful treatment more likely, at a far lower cost. </p>

<p data-line-id="2b1b211045d845a69adf95e1ba1684f8"> NEW YORK – As we move from UN Climate Week to COP28 in Dubai later this year, we must stop the “greenwishing” and “greenwashing” and start thinking about the instruments that will enable the private sector and private investors to channel more capital toward climate resilience and sustainable development. While the public sector has an important role to play in this respect, scalable solutions require significant <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/19/cop28-president-unga-transform-climate-finance-bridge-trillion-gap-environment-politics-sultan-al-jaber/">commitments of private-sector resources</a>. With climate change already wreaking havoc on poor and rich countries alike, unlocking this largely untapped pool of capital has become an urgent priority. </p><p data-line-id="e0cd434747114695b2a69ee8c319a11b"> Yet as matters stand, many investors associate climate-centric investments with “social impact” and reduced profitability. While sophisticated investors have the means to deploy their capital profitably toward decarbonization, the energy transition, and other climate-related sectors, such investments tend to be illiquid. They remain tightly wound up in private-equity funds, and thus inaccessible to the ordinary investors and savers who are most exposed to climate-driven food, water, and energy insecurity. </p><p data-line-id="a5765387afd24251a0805a9198166b7f"> The solution is to create climate investments that are profitable, liquid, and accessible to all. COP28 offers an opportunity to rethink how we deliver such market solutions, and how we can harness digital innovation to scale up promising models. To mobilize capital at scale, we must draw on the global savings of individual investors as well as institutions such as pension funds, insurers, and sovereign funds. Risk diversification can be achieved through retail-friendly, liquid, easily accessible instruments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </p><p data-line-id="e517c342d9874a6e87011aa5daa5b979"> The sensible way to construct a profitable, long-term, climate-aligned, widely accessible investment strategy is to develop a diversified portfolio of assets that directly or indirectly support climate financing. For investors with a long-term horizon, a portfolio that meets these requirements should be composed of three main asset types. </p><p data-line-id="5326da3f4a454169b191f43a49a2af62"> The first is climate-resilient real estate and infrastructure – meaning assets in weather-proof, stable geographies that have low climate exposure. Real-estate and infrastructure valuations in such regions are poised to appreciate significantly on the back of population shifts from high-risk areas across the Southern Hemisphere to more resilient communities in North America, Northern Eurasia, and select geographies in the Global South. </p><figure data-line-id="23d5546b058f46a5ac196f084af4272d"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz56252HDug?si=YNDlmWq99L-cNSQQ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></figure><p data-line-id="d3c10ddea2bb407eb45454f1a855d328"> Carefully selected Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and exposure to greenfield developments through ETFs are two ways to secure reliable returns from climate-adaptation efforts. And as an added bonus, such investments offer broader economic and societal benefits, including productivity growth, job creation, and the provision of employment and housing for migrating populations. </p><p data-line-id="a8c1be66191a4c3c9eadbb1749dba189"> The second component is green commodities. An orderly transition to a more resilient future requires massive investments not only in energy, food, and water assets, but also in the metals and critical minerals used in renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). These include commodities such as soy, wheat, copper, rare-earth elements, cobalt, lithium, and so forth. To avoid “greenflation” (inflation caused by decarbonization efforts) and supply bottlenecks, we urgently need to boost production and lower the cost of securing these commodities. </p>

<p data-line-id="372de44eaf274b2281970ee78a260f6a"> Finally, a sensible climate-aligned portfolio should include assets that provide a hedge against inflation and geo-economic risks, such as short-term and inflation-indexed sovereign bonds and gold. Not only does the negative correlation between these assets and other climate-related investments offer extra ballast, but it also provides liquidity and low volatility to meet the needs of many individual investors, pensioners, and savers. And again, there is an added bonus: greater investments in inflation-proof sovereign assets will allow governments to do more to finance the green transition. </p><p data-line-id="fd7d07c21b2b4764ae318bc3e23827b3"> To achieve maximum impact, these climate-investment instruments must be made available to the average investor on liquid, low-cost terms. While ETFs can help, not everyone has a brokerage account, or even a bank account. We tend to overlook the unbanked populations of the Global South, as well as the younger generations for whom digital assets may be more appealing. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services#:~:text=Globally%2C%20some%201.4%20billion%20adults,go%2C%20much%20more%20is%20needed.">1.4 billion adults</a> are unbanked globally, and the share of the unbanked population exceeds 50% in several Middle Eastern, Asian, and African countries with larger youth (“digital native”) populations. </p><p data-line-id="ed3cfee2c9fc4fa281ea9177078f2f50"> Owing to these factors, we will need to come up with a digital, tokenized representation of all the aforementioned climate-investment solutions, both to achieve global scale and to protect those most at risk of climate change and fiat currency debasement. But digital assets can offer a viable solution only if they are backed by real-world physical and financial assets. Mitigating speculation risks and preserving liquidity during crises is crucial to ensure that these do not become yet another form of fundamentally worthless crypto vaporware. </p><p data-line-id="668168216bb54fd9ae38a296d0fa1a98"> To build climate-resilient communities, encourage cross-border public-private partnerships, secure critical green supplies, and accommodate climate-driven population shifts around the world, policymakers and asset owners urgently need to rethink how we channel capital at scale. With climate-driven costs escalating rapidly, innovation (both technological and financial) remains the most powerful tool at our disposal. With COP28 approaching, there is no more time for temporizing and empty green-wishing. </p>

So why, Krugman asks, do voters give Biden’s economy a lousy <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-economy-poll-trump-2024-c3fc17ffe3e1a9c865e2f9627ef4bea4#:~:text=Only%2036%25%20of%20U.S.%20adults,Center%20for%20Public%20Affairs%20Research.">36% approval rating</a>? </p><p data-line-id="4f1e3ca049ad4c0da780d38d864edd88"> Journalist Glenn Greenwald sees <a href="https://rumble.com/v3hgfja-system-update-show-147.html">class bias</a> in<strong> </strong>Krugman’s wonderment: as though Krugman were just another pampered rentier with ample cash, real estate, stocks, and bonds. But this is most unfair. Though I have not been to Krugman’s home, I have seen his ultra-modest office at the City University of New York.

Republicans, gunning for Carter, availed themselves of the “<a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/291/unemployment/the-misery-index/">misery index</a>,” a measure comprising the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates in a given month or year. As a polemical device, the index was devastating, especially in 1980, when Carter’s <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-irans-1979-revolution-meant-for-us-and-global-oil-markets/">credit controls</a> caused a short recession, just after the Iranian Revolution’s shock to oil prices.

<p data-line-id="8290b4c1376d42b1b754b7723034ea8a"> TORONTO – Many experts believe that the US dollar’s global hegemony, which has endured for nearly 80 years, is finally coming to an end. This outcome is not impossible: economic crises, increased domestic polarization, and strong geopolitical headwinds could indeed culminate in the currency’s meltdown. But it is not likely. </p><p data-line-id="253ba37a1f5545a2b33e83b411023770"> Debates about the future of the international monetary system often fail to appreciate the greenback’s full-spectrum dominance, which requires understanding its role in public and private markets, as well as the various incentives to hold dollars. So long as self-reinforcing synergies and forms of opportunism continue to prevail, narrowing the yawning chasm between the dollar and other currencies will remain difficult. </p><p data-line-id="66462f5717cc44f9a2163505cefaa9d4"> To be sure, there are threats to dollar supremacy. The greenback’s primacy and pervasiveness in the global financial system has become a major bone of contention in the great-power struggle between the United States, China, and Russia. These geopolitical challenges are happening against a backdrop of high interest rates and America’s polarized politics, which prompted the drawn-out negotiations over the US debt ceiling earlier this year; taken together, they risk undermining the perceived safety of dollar assets. But for the greenback to be unseated, multiple actors must support a substantial currency shift. </p>

<p data-line-id="ab5a6a495a6a4dbabc17c0b7934f0aed"> WASHINGTON, DC/CAIRO – When the <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/">Green Climate Fund</a> (GCF) was established a little over a decade ago, it was considered a potentially useful tool to support developing countries in the shift to climate-resilient and low-emission development pathways. Today, it is the world’s largest climate-dedicated fund, representing a significant share of the war chest for combating global warming. It must be adequately funded to succeed.  </p><p data-line-id="dd04bda878014a8286269b84420ae31b"> To continue financing ambitious climate action, the GCF will need traditional contributors to increase their pledges and new contributors to step forward during its second replenishment round, which is currently underway. It is no exaggeration to say that the GCF’s replenishment campaign is a test of the world’s commitment to fighting climate change; a successful outcome will help developed countries rebuild trust by showing that they understand the urgency of the crisis and that they can deliver on their commitments. </p><p data-line-id="f6d13e8a7bd64ff792aad0f230cb92a3"> The two most recent United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP26 and COP27) have shown that world leaders recognize the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius. But the implementation challenge – highlighted at last year’s COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris in June, and this month’s Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi – is delivering the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/finance-for-climate-action-scaling-up-investment-for-climate-and-development/">$2.4 trillion</a> that developing countries will need annually by 2030 to achieve this goal. </p><p data-line-id="4c73d0c3d8f44949ac5e517cbc64876e"> The developing world faces fierce headwinds in mitigating and adapting to climate change. During the past year, the United States and the European Union have announced massive subsidies to incentivize domestic clean-energy investments. These policies will likely lead to rapid advances in green technology. But, when coupled with rising interest rates and finance costs, they will also make it more difficult for the developing countries seeking to benefit from these innovations to attract capital. </p><p data-line-id="17680d4114a34e74b51ee24e523bd7c9"> Moreover, the total number of green bonds issued by developing countries fell between 2020 and 2022, while those issued in the West <a href="https://www.ice.com/insights/impact-bond-report-q2-2023">increased</a>. And the <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/it-s-time-to-make-clean-energy-investment-in-emerging-and-developing-economies-a-top-global-priority">widening renewables gap</a> between developed and developing countries comes on top of a <a href="https://unctad.org/news/unctad-calls-urgent-support-developing-countries-attract-massive-investment-clean-energy">slowdown</a> in clean-energy investments in 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are further harming emerging-market economies. </p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-line-id="4df2a4cc19054b5f97ded8b3ac6e2119" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0Ctac_ImqY?si=mnRsdFRW5skYJDQf" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><p data-line-id="1043db8e155c42198a7da5b089d9d19f"> The war in Ukraine has also complicated the green transition by <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-crisis-mess-causes-headache-for-coal-regions-transition/">derailing</a> some countries’ plans to phase out coal power and fossil fuels. Many other countries have revised their net-zero timelines and commitments, while the corporate sector has also revised its targets downward. Perhaps more importantly, owing to record increases in food, fuel, and fertilizer prices (largely a byproduct of the war), interest-rate hikes, and unsustainable debt burdens, many developing countries have depleted their foreign-exchange reserves and lack the fiscal space to pursue their climate goals. </p><p data-line-id="69ef3eb02de84d9a9c3c2493213c64b2"> At the same time, climate change is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bbc0256a-f151-44c2-9bc9-ef8f280a70b9">driving</a> ever more extreme and anomalous weather events, from <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/22/africa-cyclone-freddy-climate-change-extreme-weather/">cyclones</a> in Southern Africa and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/libya-flooding-death-toll-storm-daniel/story?id=103214362">Libya</a>, to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66229532">typhoons</a> in East Asia and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/15/south-america-heat-wave-extreme-weather">droughts</a> in Latin America. If these events continue apace, an estimated <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/climate-refugees-the-world-s-forgotten-victims/">1.2 billion people</a> could be displaced by 2050. Many developing countries are thus increasingly vulnerable to climate-related disasters through <a href="https://unctad.org/ldc2022">no fault of their own</a> and have already started directing domestic resources to adaptation efforts. </p><p data-line-id="a244a64b74a84915887c401e0bd169b5"> The exponential increase in the scale and frequency of extreme weather, and the mounting costs associated with such events, stands in stark contrast to the slow pace of the global response. This incongruence, coupled with a severe lack of financial instruments that do not generate debt, has diminished developing countries’ trust in the global financial architecture. While the developed world can spend billions on government subsidies and incentives to encourage the green transition at home, low- and middle-income countries suffer the most from delays in climate mitigation and adaptation globally. Even more unsettling is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/04/banks-pour-trillions-fossil-fuel-expansion-global-south-report-says">flood of investment</a> pouring into the fossil-fuel industry to expand operations globally.  </p>

<p data-line-id="739bfc765fbe4b658c7d5a40ce350b55"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/2023/08/14/what-are-just-energy-transition-partnerships-jetps-and-how-do-they-work/a7bfb5aa-3b03-11ee-aefd-40c039a855ba_story.html">Just Energy Transition Partnerships</a>, launched at COP26, made headlines with the promise to funnel money from wealthy countries to the highest emitters in the developing world. Furthermore, COP27 had a similar impact with the establishment of a “loss and damage fund” for developing countries facing the effects of climate change, as well as official calls to reform international financial institutions and to scale up funding for the GCF. But they have yet to deliver, and the global climate financing gap continues to widen as a result. As costs increase exponentially, the developing world is losing hope. </p><p data-line-id="82e2b1cf31b4410d945f520004506493"> This trend, however, is not irreversible. The developed world and institutions like the GCF can take the initiative in three key areas to restore developing countries’ trust and shore up their climate resilience. For starters, developed countries must significantly increase funding for the GCF – the one international institution whose sole responsibility is to fight climate change. The GCF can do much more, especially by helping to build and implement country programs and adaptation plans, and by enabling the delivery of emissions-reduction projects. </p><p data-line-id="fd93ab2e9e6d4f84ac4baa79da405b1f"> To leapfrog climate technologies, for example, developing countries need financing to adopt scalable adaptation and mitigation strategies. Moreover, investment in technology transfers can transform other sectors and industries – such as agriculture – in addition to fighting climate change. </p><p data-line-id="58729e248723481792b8cd5b9b41701c"> Likewise, with more capital, the GCF can offer and contribute to cheaper financing for developing countries. That way, they can bolster climate mitigation and adaptation without increasing their debt levels and thus attract more investment. As it becomes widely understood that climate finance is development finance, the GCF could play an important role in increasing the number of debt-for-nature swaps and developing other innovative tools. This includes working with philanthropists and private-sector actors to identify solutions, test them at low cost, and provide guidance on scale. Lastly, the GCF can, through its readiness program, help improve data collection for decision-making purposes.  </p><p data-line-id="707960e2f3214399888a63db9c2826ed"> When it comes to combating global warming, developed countries must fulfill their responsibilities to the rest of the world. The best way to do that is through showing progress in funding the GCF to support its project pipeline and programming capacity. As the past few years have demonstrated, climate change knows no borders, and responding to this existential threat requires mobilizing the world. Anything less would guarantee defeat. </p>

<p data-line-id="83a67b92c36242d4868cb36517a32202"> NEW HAVEN – It has been puzzling to see many prominent economists decry the Trump administration’s tariffs as welfare-reducing protectionism, while approving of the Biden administration’s even more drastic steps to reshore, friend-shore, and decouple from China. In a March 2018 Chicago Booth <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/steel-and-aluminum-tariffs/">poll</a> of economists, 100% of respondents opposed new US tariffs; but then a largely overlapping set of respondents were <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/global-supply-chains/">skeptical of global supply chains</a> when asked in January 2022. Only two respondents (with me being one of them) disagreed that a reliance on foreign inputs had made US industries vulnerable to disruptions. </p><p data-line-id="e30247628c7544838efbc46936e11002"> One exception to this broader pattern is <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/dani-rodrik">Dani Rodrik</a>, who argued in a recent <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-economy-biggest-risk-is-geopolitics-not-protectionism-by-dani-rodrik-2023-09">commentary</a> that the ramifications of geopolitics are much more severe than renewed protectionism. He makes an important point; still, one must remember that protectionism was a major catalyst for today’s escalating geopolitical tensions. </p><p data-line-id="a1ab407085f3414f9659df701a3f7cab"> The Trump tariffs both reversed a long-term trend toward trade liberalization and imposed <a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/pennygoldberg/files/2021/05/qjz036.pdf">real costs</a> on the US economy by raising prices for US consumers and for US firms that use imported intermediate inputs from China. But Trump’s policies had little impact on global trade overall. While trade between the United States and China declined, as expected, many other countries’ exports – both to the US and to the rest of the world – <a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/pennygoldberg/files/2021/05/qjz036.pdf">increased</a>. Trade flows were reallocated, not reduced. </p>

<p data-line-id="828946eb4d624e138021d445c2b72523"> WASHINGTON, DC – The exponential growth of international capital flows, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691221106/a-crash-course-on-crises">predominantly</a> in the form of debt, has been one of the great development successes of the past 50 years. But while foreign lending has played a pivotal role for developing economies, loans are a two-edged sword. When used judiciously, they can generate high returns, boost GDP growth, and improve the well-being of borrower countries. But if debts accumulate and the debt-servicing burden increases without a commensurate increase in repayment capacity, the consequences can be severe and even disastrous. </p><p data-line-id="524ae4000a9847aa9af0ed827269a500"> During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, many countries grappled with a dramatic increase in fiscal demands, driven by rising public-health expenditures and a drop in revenues due to reduced economic activity. Highly indebted countries edged closer to the brink of default, and even those with previously sustainable public finances experienced a dangerous surge in their debt burdens. </p><p data-line-id="40428f507ec3401497235b4bcf78d564"> When debt levels are high and rising, crises can emerge suddenly and worsen quickly. While several governments have taken steps to reduce their elevated debt levels and introduced reforms to avert potential crises, some countries’ debt-servicing costs are so high that meaningful adjustments are politically or economically unfeasible. Under such conditions, skeptical private creditors sell these countries’ sovereign bonds at reduced prices and refuse to extend further credit. Once this happens and governments default on their obligations, they find themselves shut out of capital markets. The subsequent economic crisis typically persists until these countries can restructure their existing debts, implement policy reforms, and restore confidence in their creditworthiness. </p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wolf emerged as a vocal anti-vaccine advocate, frequently appearing on far-right platforms and claiming that public-health measures were part of an insidious global plot.

The just-concluded G20 summit in New Delhi attracted as much attention for who was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/us-says-modi-disappointed-that-china-russia-skipped-g-20-summit">not there</a> – Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping – as for the discussions among those who showed up. But the real takeaway from the summit, as well as the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-should-quit-brics-by-arvind-subramanian-and-josh-felman-2023-09">gathering of the BRICS</a> (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that preceded it, is that global rule-making is set to become increasingly uneven, shaped by small groups, swing states, and fluid coalitions. </p><p data-line-id="d2e6a5258c26453294c264da4e9825a7"> Even without Putin and Xi, palpable divisions marked the G20 summit, belying its optimistic <a href="https://www.narendramodi.in/category/news/one-earth-one-family-one-future">theme</a>: “one earth, one family, one future.” While India, which has worked hard to position itself as a unifying diplomatic force and a spokesperson of the Global South, managed to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/09/g20-leaders-agree-joint-declaration-after-deal-on-ukraine-statement"> </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/09/g20-leaders-agree-joint-declaration-after-deal-on-ukraine-statement">secure consensus</a> on a final declaration, this was no easy feat, owing not least to disagreements over how to refer to the Ukraine war. </p><p data-line-id="531785b3821e4a1085df32e50801c18b"> The compromises this demanded were reflected in the summit’s<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/66739/g20-new-delhi-leaders-declaration.pdf"> </a><a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/66739/g20-new-delhi-leaders-declaration.pdf">final declaration</a>, which featured far softer language on the Ukraine war – and, in particular, Russia’s culpability – than the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/"> </a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/">declaration</a> that was issued in Bali last November. In 2022, G20 leaders acknowledged that perspectives on the invasion differed, but also strongly condemned Russia’s actions and calling for the withdrawal of its troops. In 2023, they lamented the “immense human suffering and the adverse impact of wars and conflicts around the world,” issued a <em>pro forma </em>exhortation to abjure the use of nuclear weapons, and touted the hallowed principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity – all without mentioning Ukraine by name. </p>

<p data-line-id="1c0f288309ca48ed97699802a71c30b4"> STOCKHOLM – Russian President Vladimir Putin had obvious reasons for hosting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un at Vostochny, Russia’s new spaceport in eastern Siberia, this month. Owing to his illegal war of aggression in Ukraine, Putin is running low on both friends and ammunition. </p><p data-line-id="fdf8ca3584824ca1b2b7af412811ea66"> The Vostochny spaceport has a troubled history. Intended to replace the Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan, its construction was plagued by repeated delays and allegations of corruption and mismanagement. Now, it is rarely used – though it did launch the high-profile Luna-25 mission that <a href="https://www.space.com/russia-luna-25-moon-crash-site-lro-photos">crashed</a> into the moon recently. </p><p data-line-id="9a47b2ea06ac4722943588f102d538a1"> Russian-North Korean relations have a similar backstory. Once upon a time, the bond between the Kremlin and the Kim regime was tight. After all, communist North Korea was essentially a Soviet creation, and it relied heavily on Soviet support for decades. But following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian leaders saw more to gain by developing relations with booming South Korea. The Kremlin effectively switched sides, joining the (unsuccessful) international effort to prevent the Hermit Kingdom from developing nuclear weapons. </p>

<p data-line-id="86648a2a900a4d528ec35542cf429340"> WASHINGTON, DC – The poorest countries are in <a href="https://bit.ly/GEPJune2023TopicalIssue2">desperate straits</a>, and the rest of the world is looking the other way. Doing so comes easy, because low-income countries (LICs) matter little to the fate of the world in the near term. At the end of June, the combined GDP of the 28 countries in this group was roughly $<a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/">500 billion</a> – a drop in the $100 trillion ocean that is the global economy. The world’s poorest countries are also nobody’s ideal export markets: the average annual income is barely $1,000, and conflict and instability are the norm for about half. </p><p data-line-id="159fb9b52fa54af7a2c9759579befd4b"> Nonetheless, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=XM">700 million</a> people live in these countries, and about half of them are in extreme poverty. Very poor people have long been accustomed to neglect from their own governments, which often have other priorities. For example, they spend about <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7859d428-d709-40eb-ad7c-d0dabc5066f0/content">50% more</a> on war and defense than they do on health care. Nearly half their budgets go toward <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7859d428-d709-40eb-ad7c-d0dabc5066f0/content">public-sector wages</a> and interest payments on debt, while a mere 3% of total government spending across LICs goes to support the most vulnerable citizens. That is one-tenth the average for developing economies more broadly. </p><p data-line-id="fa62ee761ddf4c1b898481896bc3f61f"> It therefore should surprise no one that a human tragedy is now unfolding in these countries. Key <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7859d428-d709-40eb-ad7c-d0dabc5066f0/content">indicators of human development</a> in today’s LICs are far worse now than they were in the LICs of 2000, before many of the latter had ascended to middle-income status. For example, maternal mortality is 25% higher now, and the share of the population with access to electricity has fallen from 52% to barely 40% across this cohort. Average life expectancy is now just 62 years, among the lowest rates in the world. </p>

<p data-line-id="5f56f2caccf74dad8cd1c05eaed8c592"> TEL AVIV – Peace processes tend to be riddled with uncertainties, especially when conflicts are protracted and each side’s intentions, willingness, and capacity to comply with any agreement remain unclear. The significant political costs associated with making concessions to a mortal enemy often doom negotiations before any agreement is reached. </p><p data-line-id="b6d41d6da0814e338cb86185c3269d30"> This is evident in the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-756776">recently declassified</a> protocols of the 1993 Israeli cabinet meeting that approved the first Oslo Accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The records <a href="https://www.jns.org/israel-palestinianconflict/oslo-accords/23/8/31/315115/">reveal</a> that the signs of eventual failure were apparent from the very beginning. </p><p data-line-id="d22fe5a5bf3d4c2d815b7e1f56d5c73d"> At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin hoped that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could stem the rise of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and assist in quelling the Intifada that had been <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/intifada-begins-on-gaza-strip">raging</a> in the West Bank and Gaza since 1987. But Arafat, wary of being perceived as a “collaborator,” refused to become Israel’s security subcontractor. Rabin’s fatalistic foreign minister, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/shimon-peres">Shimon Peres</a>, warned that “the whole PLO business” could “fall apart” and that an “Iran-like Hamas” could take its place. Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces’ Chief of General Staff <a href="https://www1.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ehud-barak">Ehud Barak</a> famously <a href="https://allisrael.com/30-years-after-oslo-accords-cabinet-meeting-protocols-are-revealed">remarked</a> that the agreement had “more holes than Swiss cheese.” </p>

<p data-line-id="c1d4d355ff84446e9f1d72af850bfb0d"> CHICAGO – A new legal effort to prevent Donald Trump from retaking the presidency next year is afoot. Its backers rely on Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, which bars from office anyone who has “engaged in insurrection or rebellion … or given aid or comfort to the enemies” of the United States.  </p><p data-line-id="06167ed9641a4491bc40d06053a56cd9"> Numerous <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/press-releases/lawsuit-filed-to-remove-trump-from-ballot-in-co-under-14th-amendment/">lawsuits</a> have been filed arguing that Trump’s participation in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 – either by itself or as part of a larger effort to nullify the 2020 election – disqualifies him. Could a constitutional provision adopted in 1868 really save American democracy in 2024? </p><p data-line-id="ee144bc8180c451f814db31e46ac0b21"> Section Three has already been used successfully to remove from office a New Mexico county commissioner named Couy Griffin, the organizer of “Cowboys for Trump,” who helped rally members of the mob that breached the Capitol on January 6. But the effort to remove Trump from the ballot has received further support from a recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4532751">article</a> by two distinguished constitutional law professors, William Baude of the University of Chicago Law School and Michael Stokes Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law, who argue that Section Three does indeed apply. </p>

<p data-line-id="48dfc59fbefe415aa1e7e55e2b71416f"> MANCHESTER – What if we could build wooden houses without felling a tree? What if we could fish in such a way that left egg-producing females in the sea? And what if we could fill our forests with a wide array of edible plants, making commercially farmed forests look comparatively barren? Though they may seem impossible, these practices have existed for centuries, suggesting that the future we need is to be found in our past. </p><p data-line-id="fbc3e3f061aa4cd1a495b300f8982560"> Climate change has become a time bomb, and the need to develop new ways of living that are far gentler on the planet has never been greater. But we stubbornly adhere to the same old mantra of innovation, technology, and unrestrained growth – offering lip service to sustainability while encouraging nature-destroying activities that are rapidly making the planet unlivable. </p><p data-line-id="0250e0a30e0f4ed1aed0d02bfbbfdceb"> Even so-called “green” technologies accelerate production and promote consumption. Consider electric vehicles, bicycles, and scooters: manufacturing these goods requires ever more energy and resources and inevitably results in more emissions and waste. </p>

Even Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has commented on it, though he belongs to the populist ruling party. What does your title mean, and how are you defining populism?</p></div><p data-line-id="9fc57f9c4af0474795d0a6fb5e7d3458"><strong>Sławomir Sierakowski:</strong> We wanted to understand populism as a social phenomenon. That meant examining the specific societal factors behind populist victories, and then studying how populist victories have changed society. No one else has approached the subject like that. </p><p data-line-id="7deb2d55a3894e93815a1b62761674c7"> Populism is a reaction to the unfulfilled promises of democracy. Or, rather, it is a reaction to globalization and the perception that decisions are increasingly made by experts and financial markets that exist beyond the scope of democratic structures. Populism is an attempt to reclaim people’s voices. But an interesting question remains: Why does this supposedly healthy reaction lead to such poor results – from the crisis of democracy to the rise of international conflicts?  </p><p data-line-id="371cb5d805c64046a5f0af59d05a8f31"> Our book is the culmination of research conducted over four years. We surveyed more than 20,000 Poles, held dozens of focus groups, and interviewed experts on various topics. It was the most comprehensive research project on Polish political life since 1989. The book, however, is a polemic. It belongs next to other recent works on populism such as <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/jan-werner-mueller">Jan-Werner Mueller’s</a> <a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9780812248982/what-is-populism/"><em>What Is Populism?</em></a>, Anne Applebaum’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/621076/twilight-of-democracy-by-anne-applebaum/"><em>Twilight of Democracy</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/jason-stanley">Jason Stanley’s</a> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/586030/how-fascism-works-by-jason-stanley/"><em>How Fascism Works</em></a>. </p>

<p data-line-id="2a15b06c40944f7aaa441c4200c36437"> LUXEMBOURG – Throughout human history, raw materials have played a key role in economic development, international relations, and the destinies of entire nations and civilizations. From precious metals (silver and gold) and agricultural commodities (sugar, rubber, silk, and spices) to energy resources such as oil and gas, changes in demand spurred by technological developments have rewritten global trade patterns, shifted fortunes, and often fueled conflict and exploitation. </p><p data-line-id="bf3e063723704a3cb8f538e9e52c1558"> In the 2020s, we are becoming increasingly reliant on a new set of critical raw materials, including <a href="https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/what-are-rare-earth-elements-and-why-are-they-important">rare-earth elements</a> (REEs) and <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/josh-goldman/electric-vehicles-batteries-cobalt-and-rare-earth-metals/">metals</a> such as lithium, gallium, and germanium. These commodities’ use in everything from solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines to computer chips for industry and defense makes them vital to the green and digital transitions, which in turn will determine our future on this planet. </p><p data-line-id="0023038eb11c4472984f04fe12249bfe"> Europe will never be able to meet its own demand for REEs or lithium domestically, but nor should that be its goal. The goal, rather, is to secure access to critical raw materials so that we do not find ourselves at the mercy of those who might weaponize them – as the Kremlin has done with <a href="https://www.ponarseurasia.org/how-russia-s-energy-weapon-turned-into-an-oil-pillow-and-gas-rattle/">hydrocarbons</a>. Such access is crucial for strengthening our strategic autonomy, maintaining our competitiveness, and meeting our climate ambitions. </p>

<p data-line-id="c902fff6dba14e259c0e8dc077ed735e"> BERWYN, ILLINOIS/NAIROBI – African leaders and global policymakers recently gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, for the inaugural <a href="https://africaclimatesummit.org/">Africa Climate Summit</a> to discuss the challenges of funding climate solutions. The summit showed that private-sector investments, in particular, could go a long way toward accelerating the continent’s energy transition. </p><p data-line-id="acbc1c45a8f945478d18e97c9a1b39a4"> Efforts are already underway to attract more foreign capital, especially from the United States. When US Vice President Kamala Harris visited Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia earlier this year, she announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/31/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-over-7-billion-in-private-sector-and-u-s-government-commitments-to-promote-climate-resilience-adaptation-and-mitigation-across-africa/">nearly 30 private-sector and philanthropic commitments</a> to support climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation across Africa. But the continent’s needs are far from being met. An estimated <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/africa-needs-700-billion-of-finance-for-green-energy-and-metals">$700 billion</a> will be required to develop green energy in Africa, and yet it received <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2022/Jan/IRENA_Market_Africa_2022.pdf?rev=bb73e285a0974bc996a1f942635ca556">only 2% of the $2.8 trillion</a> invested globally in renewables between 2000 and 2020. </p><p data-line-id="7455f7ed1a194108b1145e1d9a7f4fd4"> The main barrier to increasing green financing is risk perception: many private-sector actors are concerned about Africa’s investment climate. It is no secret that many African countries are contending with inadequate infrastructure and bureaucratic red tape, both of which could deter foreign investors. But these countries are also working to remove such obstacles. Kenya, for example, is in the process of pursuing structural reforms to enhance <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/downloadpdf/journals/002/2023/266/002.2023.issue-266-en.xml">private-financing mechanisms</a>. </p><p data-line-id="280b77d0e12b4732b953f7568828d1c4"> Moreover, the economic mismanagement and internal strife that have come to characterize some African countries are not representative of the entire continent. Africa is open for business. Countries such as <a href="https://mideastlaw.de/en/news/renewable-energies-in-morocco/">Morocco</a> and <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-investment-climate-statements/kenya/">Kenya</a>, in their efforts to spur the green transition and drive sustainable development, have introduced financial incentives, including tax breaks, and implemented policy reforms to attract and mitigate risk for private investors from the US and elsewhere. </p><figure data-line-id="b57dc2f5c96c4126b8c4d9bb58b86145"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-line-id="62f4e775e6b74bd8a16118ceec7171cc" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHEvLP_9BaA?si=zlVt_SAwffMfBzeH" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></figure><p data-line-id="877e4c6e90874f25a8d317c0a8b89c57"> Perhaps more importantly, Africa’s energy sector has already <a href="https://energycapitalpower.com/renewable-energy-projects-resource-africa/">put itself on the path</a> toward a carbon-free future, rather than waiting on foreign capital. Kenya is one of the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/country-case-kenya-taps-the-earth-heat">top global producers of geothermal energy</a>, and Morocco is home to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/02/04/worlds-largest-concentrated-solar-plant-opened-in-morocco">world’s largest concentrated solar power plant</a>. Next year, Egypt is set to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-20/egypt-to-start-building-11-billion-wind-farm-from-2024#xj4y7vzkg">build a wind farm</a> that could generate enough electricity to meet domestic needs and export to Europe and Saudi Arabia. Alongside large-scale projects, numerous privately funded micro-grids are supplying much-needed power to <a href="https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2020-05/UNIDO%20Case%20Studies_for%20web.pdf">hospitals</a> and even <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/13/business/morocco-solar-village-intl/index.html">entire villages</a>. </p><p data-line-id="025fd4c20e544a2a83a2a593fad3b6d1"> Many of these renewable projects have been funded by both the public and private sectors, although investment from the former tends to be higher. Africa’s success in creating clean-energy markets, despite relatively low levels of foreign private investment, is a testament to local officials’ dedication to building a more sustainable future. </p><p data-line-id="af67c2ae5de84cfcb7749983a28b48eb"> With an abundance of solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro energy resources, Africa has immense investment potential and can offer reliable returns to private investors. And many African countries are eager to create the conditions that will allow investors to tap into their clean-energy markets. For example, in Namibia, which averages <a href="https://www.info-namibia.com/info/namibia-weather">300 days of sunshine per year</a>, the state-owned power utility <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/countries-scaling-renewable-energy-fastest">attracted foreign capital</a> by authorizing independent power projects and holding solar-energy auctions at competitive rates. </p><figure data-line-id="b57dc2f5c96c4126b8c4d9bb58b86145"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-line-id="62f4e775e6b74bd8a16118ceec7171cc" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJ2TKQqyHzg?si=mXkoaGi1nqo7fryx" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></figure>

<p data-line-id="b8a34cd239c348cf85abf9a0e5808b29">Scaling up clean-energy investments in African countries will bring additional benefits, including more sustainable economies and faster progress toward development goals. The biggest benefit, though, is that clean energy addresses the root cause of climate change: burning fossil fuels. Africa is bearing the brunt of the crisis, despite accounting for the smallest share of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/global_20160818_cop21_africa.pdf">global greenhouse-gas emissions</a>. As a result, by 2050, global warming could cost the continent <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/state-of-climate-africa-highlights-water-stress-and-hazards">$50 billion annually</a>. It would be wiser to invest in renewables today, rather than pouring billions into adaptation down the line. <br/></p><p data-line-id="26c7242f783c48d18b5c11c8318acb4b"> Until private investors recognize Africa’s abundant renewable-energy potential, funding will continue to pour into oil and gas. Expensive fossil-fuel assets would serve only to increase African economies’ dependency on <a href="https://www.irena.org/news/pressreleases/2022/Jul/Renewable-Power-Remains-Cost-Competitive-amid-Fossil-Fuel-Crisis">volatile energy prices and imports</a> and accelerate global warming. </p><p data-line-id="a2628bf326a94867a60a4aa61e22a740"> There is another option: over the past decade, African countries have created sustainable and efficient clean-energy markets that protect investors and drive development on the continent’s terms. Private investors in the US and elsewhere should take advantage of this momentum to capitalize on the growth potential of renewables, expedite the green transition, and create a healthier future for all. </p>

<p data-line-id="68fd381401da4c67842d4b9fc4031166"> WASHINGTON, DC – Last week, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/us/politics/pence-populism-speech.html">speech</a> in New Hampshire, former US Vice President Mike Pence declared an “unbridgeable” divide in the Republican Party between traditional conservatism and the populism of former President Donald Trump, asserting that the latter is a “road to ruin.” </p><p data-line-id="0af7e66f98de46de8f6fd6063775ab8e"> Trump’s electoral record supports Pence’s argument. The former president is a four-time loser for the GOP. After winning the 2016 presidential election, Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020. In the 2018 midterm elections, while Trump was still in office, the Republicans lost the House of Representatives. In 2021, he sabotaged Republican efforts to win two Senate runoff elections in Georgia by throwing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/us/trump-georgia-runoff.html">public temper tantrums</a> about state leaders’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">repeated refusals</a> to overturn his defeat, handing control of the Senate to the Democrats. And Trump’s highest-profile <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/15837a32-a1b5-4d80-8c1a-7dd39ccf790b">endorsements</a> in the 2022 midterms went to candidates who significantly underperformed. </p><p data-line-id="d1a3f95a44c44aecb72cc657191a6cdb"> Looking forward to the 2024 presidential election, a new CNN/SSRS poll <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/haley-has-largest-lead-over-biden-of-any-gop-candidate-in-new-poll/">shows</a> that the GOP candidates most enamored with Trumpian populism – Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and Trump himself – are all statistically tied in hypothetical head-to-head matchups with current President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>. Only one Republican candidate beat Biden in the poll: Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations. Polls following her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/us/politics/republican-debate-donor-reactions.html">breakout performance</a> in the first GOP primary debate last month have likewise <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/29/trump-nikki-haley-desantis-debate-poll">indicated</a> that a meaningful number of Republican voters are looking at Haley in a new light. </p>

<p data-line-id="bd948b6eda26440b8cbe29748b877a44"> BUDAPEST – This summer – with its record temperatures, deadly floods, and raging wildfires, which in Canada alone destroyed the equivalent of <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/kanadas-waldbraende-als-waeren-alle-deutschen-waelder-verbrannt-das-inferno-in-grafiken-a-5e97507c-48d7-4801-8107-db62068a44f0">all the trees in Germany</a> – might have felt like a final warning: without urgent and drastic action, the current climate emergency will become an inescapable climate disaster. Some might be tempted to think that we have reached a point when our only chance of mounting a sufficiently rapid and potent response to the threat is to embrace <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/07/climate-change-democracy/">decisive state authority</a>, even outright authoritarianism. But the notion that ecologically minded authoritarians will outperform democratic leaders on climate is a dangerous fantasy. </p>
<p data-line-id="b75c6807f19c4751957a484edd92b047"> Concerns about democracies’ capacity to act swiftly and efficiently are nothing new. Government that allows all to participate (in theory, if not always in practice) makes for an imperfect and slow-moving system. Influential players can often veto actions that the majority supports. On the other hand, the view that irrational masses wield too much power – long expressed <em>sotto voce</em> – has become entirely<em> salonfähig</em> in the age of Donald Trump. For example, voters tend to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/myopic-voters-and-natural-disaster-policy/039708A3223EC114365ADF56F1D26423">punish politicians</a> for taking measures to prevent catastrophes, and reward them for appearing heroic during a disaster, even though disaster relief is far more expensive than prevention. </p>
<p data-line-id="9ae091ba70514030a1cde2e4a66f282c"> In addition to well-known prejudices – many as old as Plato’s writings – one can argue that some of democracy’s benefits do not count for much in the climate emergency. Democracies pride themselves on the fact that every decision can be revisited – that policies can be updated and improved, and that the losers in one election can become winners in the next (and thus have reason to keep playing the democratic game). But climate-related decisions have major, irreversible consequences, so even if bad choices – such as doing too little – are revisited later, serious damage will have been done. </p>
<p data-line-id="4023bd6951214f8bae1160bf9099e485"> Other contemporary criticisms are blunter. Democracies are based on compromise, but bargains often turn out to be incoherent, especially in multi-party systems, because too many different political players want to get their way. Germany’s current governing coalition would appear to be a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7edbbb0-7382-4671-bf79-3f4f68422ae2">case in point</a>. Correcting such incoherence takes time, which democracies might have under normal circumstances, but certainly do not have when the planet is becoming hotter and more apocalyptic practically by the day. </p>
<p data-line-id="7707e5f28f7d4204a1bc8a314cc73474"> Another key concern stems from the de facto dominance of business interests in capitalist democracies. Given that climate action will inevitably harm at least some capitalists’ interests, these interests seem likely to prevent the necessary steps from being taken in time – or <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/26317877221084713">perhaps ever</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="036e11223ba941628180cdf0a83f0f6d"> Now, with the climate crisis escalating fast, unabashed calls for more <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/political-legitimacy-authoritarianism-and-climate-change/E7391723A7E02FA6D536AC168377D2DE">authoritarian</a> decision-making are increasing. Some advocate a more technocratic approach, and hold up China as a shining example. (The irony that China is the world’s largest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/climate/us-china-climate-issues.html#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20world's%20biggest%20emitter,about%205.9%20billion%20tons%20annually.">greenhouse-gas emitter</a> is apparently lost on them.) Others – notably, the Swedish thinker Andreas Malm – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/21/climate-diplomacy-is-hopeless-says-author-of-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-andreas-malm">envision</a> a novel form of <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2726-corona-climate-chronic-emergency">Leninism-cum-War Communism</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="14a79806a2414427a389ca0f9be6f8dc"> These proposals raise obvious questions, which their proponents never quite address. If, for the sake of climate action, power is concentrated in the hands of a state that does not answer to the people, what would prevent abuses of that power? Why, in the absence of any mechanisms of accountability, would an authoritarian regime actually tackle climate change at all? Does one really expect the powerful interests that are currently impeding climate action not to be just as powerful, if not more so, under a climate-autocracy? </p>
<p data-line-id="7e4f68156995424094403fff9851307b"> Authoritarian regimes are notoriously corrupt. So, the notion that such a system would be free of “special interests,” and run by neutral, rational technocrats, is implausible. In fact, far from bolstering climate action, a shift toward authoritarian-style decision-making would likely make things worse. </p>
<p data-line-id="43f84d0dd5bb419080c400574fcd7641"> Climate authoritarianism might also backfire in less obvious ways. In a polity with any amount of freedom, opposition is inevitable. If the authorities deem new restrictions necessary to quell criticism or resistance, they may well end up eroding other basic freedoms, including the freedom to produce and exchange potentially transformative ideas. </p>
<p data-line-id="844732e91de44499847e19100cf463f0"> Imagine this. A group of climate scientists decry the climate dictator’s policies as insufficient and try to mobilize others to demand stronger action. In an attempt to restore “order,” the dictator imposes measures that curtail academic freedom and freedom of association. Now, not only are experts less able to influence the state’s climate response; they might not have opportunities to develop or share ideas and innovations that could enhance our collective ability to meet the climate challenge. </p>
<p data-line-id="94f9e1360e5e425a935a5743da1ad72f"> True, none of this necessarily means that democratic systems are particularly well-equipped to advance climate action. Instead, one might conclude that there are no good political instruments at all. But this neglects a key point: the obstacles to effective climate action in today’s democracies are not inherent. On the contrary, they are inconsistent with democratic ideals, and in a well-functioning democracy, should be removed. </p>
<p data-line-id="47790b9410d34de583e30e193b48090a"> The fossil-fuel industry’s disproportionate influence on the political process, for example, is not only damaging to the environment; it is also fundamentally undemocratic. Even without the urgent need to address the climate emergency, citizens would have good reason to demand change. The conclusion is clear: if we do not get serious about the climate emergency, we will not save democracy, and if we do not take democratic ideals seriously, we will not save the climate. </p>

<p data-line-id="6ef0839f51aa4d22ac4124e538e8e141"> TAIPEI – Internet connectivity is a lifeline – albeit a fragile one – for Taiwan. A recent <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2023/08/04/2003804227">war game</a> staged in Taipei with experts from the military, tech industries, academia, and government suggested that, in the event of a Chinese blockade, the island would be particularly vulnerable to a communications cutoff. </p><p data-line-id="10f9c2629e1f4f92809427a260589aea"> The threat to Taiwan’s digital infrastructure was made plain in February, when Chinese maritime vessels <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/21/matsu-islands-internet-cables-china-taiwan/">severed</a> two submarine cables connecting the island to Matsu, a tiny archipelago that belongs to Taiwan but is located just off the coast of China. The months-long outage <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/09/taiwan-matsu-internet-access-china-fishing/">deprived</a> residents of internet access and left Matsu, which houses a strategic military base, open to attacks. The damaged cables also exposed the vulnerability of the US tech giant Google, which has a <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/changhua-county/">data center</a> on Taiwan’s western coast. </p><p data-line-id="93ad5f18ea3b4aedadf3a2060569b08c"> Currently, <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/stations/asia/taiwan">15 submarine cables</a> connect Taiwan to global telecommunications. A Chinese invasion or prolonged blockade could thus cut off the island from the world, with consequences for the global economy and financial markets. Such an outcome could also threaten the security of the United States and its regional allies, including Japan. As a result, the Taiwanese government must focus on strengthening communication capabilities and ensuring robust and reliable internet connectivity. </p>

</header>
</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="ead976bddff840b594f28a905bd0a654"> MILAN – With the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly and <a></a><a href="https://www.climateweeknyc.org/">Climate Week NYC</a> about to begin, and the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) approaching fast, it is imperative that the world clarify the relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability. Far from being mutually exclusive, the former is a prerequisite for the latter: economic dynamism and improvements in living standards are vital both to finance climate action and to ensure adequate public support for it. </p>
<p data-line-id="0d795ad20c264758b244b7df7bbac4d8"> Fortunately, this is now widely understood. In June, leaders of some of the world’s largest economies – including Brazil, the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Africa – issued a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/formula-for-green-transition-that-benefits-all-by-emmanuel-macron-et-al-2023-06">joint statement</a> describing poverty reduction and protection of the planet as “converging” objectives. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf">declaration</a> released after the just-concluded G20 summit in New Delhi affirmed that “no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting for our planet.” </p>
<p data-line-id="512a7347d99c44d08ea5afa76372cfdb"> Recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/from-poverty-to-empowerment-raising-the-bar-for-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth">research</a> by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI)<a> </a>attaches figures to these twin objectives, with sobering results. Begin with the cost of action to protect the planet. The cumulative additional spending on low-emissions technologies and infrastructure that is needed to close the net-zero investment gap by 2030 would cost $41 trillion, or the equivalent of 4% of global GDP annually.  </p>
<p data-line-id="098c4aad174f42258230043fde74f293"> Fulfilling these investment needs and achieving the net-zero transition will require broad public support and participation. Because people living in poverty are less likely to support climate action, especially if they feel that their needs are being given lower priority, simultaneous efforts to improve living standards are essential. </p>
<p data-line-id="8ce9aa25f91d40849d0e4354ea1aa5a8"> This is not a matter merely of lifting more households above the World Bank’s extreme poverty line ($2.15 per day at purchasing power parity). To achieve sustainable development, we must clear a higher bar, which MGI characterizes as the “empowerment line.” </p>
<p data-line-id="a44add3d66fb4fb6a91c115936da27bf"> The precise placement of the empowerment line varies by country, reflecting cost-of-living differences. But the meaning is always the same. It is the threshold beyond which households have sufficient means to meet all of their basic needs – such as nutrition, decent housing, health care, and quality education – and to work toward economic security. Without the ability to save, households cannot build a buffer against shocks, including those created by climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="8f544a7a7d34400e83aa534857111b16"> Globally, about 4.7 billion people do not qualify as fully economically empowered, with about 40% of this population residing in India and Sub-Saharan Africa, though India’s high growth, if sustained, is likely to reduce this figure. Moreover, many in middle- and higher-income countries who seem to have achieved “middle class” lifestyles lack an adequate buffer against emergencies and shocks, and struggle to afford housing and health care. While they might not formally qualify as “poor,” they are unable to realize their full potential and may be at risk of slipping into poverty. </p>
<p data-line-id="c82e6608d7164ae0adbf515569124bac"> Closing the “empowerment gap” by 2030 would require the world to boost cumulative consumption by these 4.7 billion people by $37 trillion – about 4% of GDP annually. (The specifics vary considerably by region.) Together with the $41 trillion to close the net-zero investment gap, we are talking about 8% of GDP each year until 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="d204321c60184702bcd95f0648052250"> The scale of the challenge is daunting, but this should not lead to paralysis. On the contrary, there is good news embedded in our research that should galvanize all stakeholders: we estimate that accelerated growth, business-led innovation, and technological advances could get the world halfway to the combined goals. </p>
<p data-line-id="69aa0e0071ab4ea6941b3841df45b21a"> Current momentum will not be enough. We must actively protect baseline growth from headwinds and commit to increasing productivity through investment in technology, new businesses, and skills development. Relevant opportunities are plentiful: innovations in artificial intelligence, financial technology, biomedical science, materials science, and more can contribute to productivity gains, inclusive growth, and the energy transition.  </p>
<p data-line-id="fc2c8abe3b2443f1a4747634c573c42f"> If accelerated growth creates better-paying jobs, and employers ensure that workers have the skills to fill them, almost two-thirds of the global empowerment gap could be eliminated, with just over two billion people crossing the empowerment line, and 600 million more escaping poverty. Meanwhile, almost $10 trillion of low-emissions spending could become viable for private actors by 2030. Economic growth, together with technological advances, could reduce the net-zero investment gap by some 40%. </p>
<p data-line-id="0ba611c601d74dea9de4ddcd04705c38"> What can be done to close both gaps? On the empowerment side, options include more investment in affordable housing, health care, and education, as well as direct support to vulnerable households. On the net-zero side, stronger public support and bolder policies could mobilize an even larger amount of private capital, further driving down the costs of low-emissions technologies. Overall, societal commitments averaging 2% of global GDP annually – $20 trillion cumulatively – could close both gaps by 2030, though these commitments risk adversely affecting the baseline economy. </p>
<p data-line-id="e95c8e326ada40ed8eb9d381d62caf16"> In any case, creative financing mechanisms will be essential. Multilateral institutions, in particular, must devise new facilities for developing economies – an effort that would be bolstered by increased capitalization of these institutions and new risk-intermediation platforms to help crowd in private capital. Other innovative solutions – say, channeling surpluses from rising energy prices toward green investments – will also be needed. For this, the global financial system must find innovative ways to accommodate large cross-border flows. </p>
<p data-line-id="e664dbf8e1714cbbaabfe23c63507b8a"> Progress will be difficult, and the price tag large. But investments in closing the empowerment and net-zero investment gaps today would lead to a more prosperous, stable world. There is perhaps no more valuable payoff. </p>

<p data-line-id="30fc9e0082c24de68478e9642244a61c"> LONDON – Following the recent summit of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), where the group agreed to add six new members, I <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brics-expansion-potential-and-limitations-by-jim-o-neill-2023-08">argued</a> that neither it nor the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – plus the European Union) has the credibility or the capacity to tackle global challenges. That leaves the G20 (comprising 19 of the world’s largest economies, plus the EU) as the only grouping with the legitimacy to offer truly global solutions to global problems. </p><p data-line-id="1b80f8c5b12242cabaca5e0da75537cb"> The <a href="https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf">joint declaration</a> that emerged from last week’s G20 summit in New Delhi provides further confirmation of this. Member states reached a consensus to address a wide range of issues. Despite obvious challenges – such as the considerable differences in how member states operate – they managed to reassert the G20’s relevance after a lengthy period in which its role had been <a href="http://project-syndicate.org/magazine/g20-is-it-still-fit-for-purpose-by-stuart-whatley-1">called into question</a>. </p><p data-line-id="8e06e25d71e94e1299509cad499c4ddf"> We should applaud those who played the biggest roles – presumably India and the US – in pushing through the final communiqué. The New Delhi declaration could be the first step in a stronger concerted effort to address global issues like climate change, the need for a revamped World Bank, infectious disease control, economic stability, the war in Ukraine, and other matters. Though this agenda was agreed in the absence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Russian and Chinese representatives who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china-says-premier-li-will-attend-g20-summit-2023-09-04/">did attend</a> would not have signed on to anything without having cleared it with their respective governments. </p>

<p data-line-id="b87550f159594603b8f0655acf70fff1"> COLOMBO – More than a year after the mass protest movement known as the <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/prot/2/2/article-p269_008.xml?language=en">Aragalaya</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/world/asia/sri-lanka-rajapaksa.html">ousted</a> Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lankans have once again taken to the streets. </p><p data-line-id="4fef6a8e6a03403aad251eb0ae9ce0b1"> The impetus for the resurgence of public discontent is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/business/sri-lanka-international-monetary-fund.html">recent bailout agreement</a> between the International Monetary Fund and President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ranil-wickremesinghe">Ranil Wickremesinghe</a>’s government. The deal, which aims to address the country’s ongoing balance-of-payments crisis, offers Sri Lanka less than $3 billion over four years – a tiny fraction of what the country needs to meet its debt-servicing requirements and just one-sixth of its foreign-exchange earnings, which amounted to <a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/press/pr/press_20230131_external_sector_performance_2022_december_e.pdf">roughly $18 billion in 2022</a>. </p><p data-line-id="d148eb7dfca44fb58ba54afe775f349b"> In exchange for this emergency loan, the IMF imposed a series of conditions that have significantly exacerbated Sri Lanka’s wage and cost-of-living crises. The mandated shift to market exchange rates, in particular, immediately led to a sharp currency devaluation, causing imported fuel and food prices to skyrocket and contributing to a <a href="http://www.cadtm.org/Domestic-Debt-Restructuring-in-Sri-Lanka-Forcing-the-poor-to-pay-the-debt-of">165% increase</a> in electricity tariffs between June 2022 and February 2023. </p>

<p data-line-id="44d4ab0c3b4f4b48974899e9309bf611"> WASHINGTON, DC – The world economy remains beset by challenges, from tight monetary, financial, and fiscal conditions to the effects of the war in Ukraine. These headwinds are impeding global growth – which is <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/07/10/world-economic-outlook-update-july-2023">expected to slow</a> to 3% this year, compared to 3.5% in 2022 – and damaging lives and livelihoods, with poverty and food insecurity on the rise, particularly in developing countries. In addressing the complex and overlapping challenges the world faces, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a region with much to offer. </p><p data-line-id="2e0aa99ffdb84513a93ea80eb5c71880"> For starters, LAC countries can help create a more resilient global food market. As early as 2017, the World Economic Forum facilitated a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2017/04/leaders-call-for-action-to-make-latin-america-breadbasket-of-the-world/">joint ministerial declaration</a> calling for the region to become the “breadbasket of the world.” And at last year’s Summit of the Americas, hosted by the United States, participants released an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/13/summit-of-americas-agriculture-producers-declaration/">Agriculture Producers Declaration</a> underscoring the important role of major LAC exporters in strengthening global food security. </p><p data-line-id="d01bd886554d49bca2564dff84080d7e"> The reason is obvious. With <a href="https://www.oecd.org/latin-america/Active-with-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf">one-quarter of the world’s arable land</a> and one-third of its freshwater resources, LAC already comprises the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/latin-american-food-security/">largest net food exporter</a> among world regions. What is needed now is new investment, especially in physical and digital infrastructure and in climate-resilient agriculture, continued technological and competitiveness improvements, and better integration into regional and global value chains. </p>

<p data-line-id="1e65b2e20c9b4c0693ac63d35853af85"> WASHINGTON, DC/RIO DE JANEIRO/NEW DELHI – Our collective future hinges on a transformative shift in our relationship with the planet. This week, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, negotiations will begin at the ministerial level to plan the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/common-agenda/summit-of-the-future">Summit of the Future</a> in 2024. Coming together to save our common home must be at the top of the agenda. </p>
<p data-line-id="d5c3d539ec0143098cedf9742536c5a8"> The triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution has accelerated and intensified in recent years. Moreover, the world is coming perilously close to irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, bleached coral reefs, and a substantial loss of tropical forests. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that global warming is set to reach or exceed the internationally agreed target of 1.5º Celsius in the coming two decades, even in the best-case scenario of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. </p>
<p data-line-id="aaca07af27c940b1b44761f7ef132a17"> Despite these risks and challenges, it is still possible to achieve a green and equitable global economy. A good starting point would be for countries and communities that have benefited the most from decades of planetary exploitation to acknowledge that they bear a special responsibility to help alleviate the climate crisis. </p>
<p data-line-id="68f8177d38464d289c1dce41c02f5ba9"> Rich countries around the world are responsible for around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/12/climate/cop26-emissions-compensation.html">half of historical carbon emissions</a>, which have been essential to their development. The Paris climate agreement thus explicitly emphasizes that environmental governance must proceed on the basis of “common but differentiated responsibilities” – a core principle of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p data-line-id="b356586d806b4197a31401a6afa30e49"> But the onus of committing to a green and just transition rests upon all of us. In wealthy countries, where the rich are responsible for far more emissions than the poor, environmental solutions must differentiate between high and low emitters. And while low- and middle-income countries have an undeniable right to pursue growth, they must develop more sustainably for the benefit of their citizens. Bilateral cooperation, as well as multilateral institutions, should help them align their policies with emissions-reduction targets, biodiversity protection, and a shift toward a circular economy. </p>
<p data-line-id="801f1e57b7fa43cb8008b90992d2caa9"> To generate the necessary political will to commit to a just green transition, countries need a vision of energy abundance, rich biodiversity, and a thriving planet. To this end, as members of the UN Secretary-General’s <a href="https://highleveladvisoryboard.org/">High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism</a> (HLAB), we propose that a Pact for the Future, which has been proposed as the outcome of the Summit of the Future, include the set of recommendations to rebalance the relationship between people and planet outlined in the <a href="https://highleveladvisoryboard.org/breakthrough/">report</a> that HLAB submitted to the UN Secretary-General in April. </p>
<p data-line-id="60124ec306ab44388569966a02112bd5"> Our proposals recognize that a healthy planet is a global public good that benefits all of humanity. It would align existing treaty commitments, raise collective ambition, and marshal the resources to enable states and non-state actors to build a net-zero future. </p>
<p data-line-id="39bfb2baf9e044c0bfad6bd83951a8e4"> For developing countries, the green transition offers a chance to join the ranks of the world’s high-income countries. While they lack the financial means to fund ambitious policies like the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">US Inflation Reduction Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">European Green Deal</a>, many of these countries have abundant natural resources, such as forests that must be safeguarded to preserve the planet and the critical minerals and rare earths required to achieve the energy transition. Moreover, global power shifts have given them additional leverage to pursue new funding options and fairer agreements to address climate challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="b0ea3ba0e2c343d8900e14f912c8d88e"> As active participants in the negotiations for a Pact for the Future, low- and middle-income countries can increase their green ambitions, take a lead in creating a sustainable future, and push back against the old “international division of labor,” in which their natural resources were exploited to create wealth and accelerate decarbonization in advanced economies. Instead, at the upcoming Summit of the Future, they can propose and negotiate multilateral agreements and financing mechanisms to deliver a just climate transition alongside the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="5910624127094a66bbae18ef43e79287"> The foundations of a Pact for the Future that works for people and planet have already been laid. The first step is to reaffirm existing treaty obligations – including the Paris climate agreement, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, and others – and to accelerate progress with time-bound targets. The pact should also commit to net-zero emissions; the phase-out of fossil fuels; the provision of clean energy to the 800 million people lacking access to electricity; a halt to deforestation (including a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/protecting-forests-key-emissions-reductions-not-enough-by-ilona-szabo-and-tasso-azevedo-2023-04">new incentive mechanism</a> to protect standing forests); biodiversity targets that respect the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the regeneration of natural systems; and a pollution-free planet. </p>
<p data-line-id="8066937fa3c9485daf59e7148505701d"> The problem is that, without investment, these commitments will remain paper promises. HLAB thus endorses the <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-levelexpertgroupupdate7.pdf">recommendations</a> of the UN High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities in 2022, which specify the scale of investment required to achieve net-zero emissions and the practical steps that member states and multilateral banks must take to begin meeting these needs. </p>
<p data-line-id="ae98218a06d34501a8809cffc72022ab"> HLAB also emphasizes that, in addition to mobilizing financial resources, a just green transition requires transfers of knowledge and technology. And it highlights the importance of pricing and regulating carbon emissions, eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies, increasing transparency concerning emissions and carbon capture, and offering incentives to accelerate the shift to clean energy. </p>
<p data-line-id="0a34dfaa51c24120b2b585a73ee706f6"> Contrary to popular belief, tackling climate change is not a zero-sum game. Regaining balance with nature would not only ensure the survival of future generations, but would also generate countless opportunities for current ones. To succeed, however, the pact must include strong commitments and establish clear expectations. With preparations for the Summit of the Future underway, now is the time to start imagining our shared path to a sustainable and equitable transition. </p>

tout distributed renewable energy as a way for the Global South to build a more resilient agricultural sector.        </p>
</header>
</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="0cf3ef1d28354cdba043d498157e51ba"> SAN FRANCISCO/ADDIS ABABA – The fabric of our global food system is fraying under the strain of climate change and an ever-expanding population. To prevent it from unraveling, we must embrace distributed renewable-energy solutions, which are critical for reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, boosting resilience and productivity, and cutting costs. Failure to do so would jeopardize efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and threaten our very survival. </p>
<p data-line-id="a877ef7175ca45ae9e7dcf79f81007ec"> Halfway to the 2030 deadline, progress toward the SDGs – <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">conceived</a> as a “shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet” – is lagging significantly. In July, the <a href="https://www.unep.org/high-level-political-forum-2023">UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development</a> in New York and the <a href="https://www.unfoodsystemshub.org/fs-stocktaking-moment/en">UN Food Systems Summit +2 Stocktaking Moment</a> in Rome underscored the importance of ensuring access to modern energy (SDG 7) and achieving zero hunger (SDG 2), respectively. </p>
<p data-line-id="69bd038642fb476fabdf0ba4c04a1d12"> When it comes to strengthening the long-term resilience and adaptability of the global food system, these two objectives are interlinked. Translating this into public policies has taken on new urgency, given that rapid global warming, population growth, public-health crises, volatile energy markets, and conflict have exposed the food system’s unique vulnerabilities and shortcomings. </p>
<p data-line-id="760ae21b187f4cde9aa9742de6b73870"> Past solutions and approaches will no longer work; on the contrary, they contributed to the current problems. Previously, concerns about food supply – including high prices during the 2008 global financial crisis – invariably led to agricultural intensification and mechanization, as well as an increase in land use. As a result, agribusiness (including the production, transport, and storage of food) today accounts for roughly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11708#:~:text=The%20global%20food%20system%2C%20from,15%20research%20centres%20around%20the">one-third of all GHG emissions</a>, which in turn threaten the future of agriculture. </p>
<p data-line-id="2873cd0999164111b1317da7c1b1512a"> While the effects of climate change are felt throughout the global food system, they are disproportionately borne by those least responsible for the problem: smallholder farmers in the Global South. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa, which relies on rainfed agriculture, already <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change#:~:text=Our%20research%20shows%20that%20a,to%20rust%2C%20a%20fungal%20disease.">experiences</a> one-third of the world’s droughts and is vulnerable to higher temperatures and other extreme weather. The International Monetary Fund has <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change#:~:text=Our%20research%20shows%20that%20a,to%20rust%2C%20a%20fungal%20disease.">found</a> that a single drought can lower an African country’s medium-term economic-growth potential by one percentage point. </p>
<p data-line-id="2e8b1112fb5143b8b6e9131b471e10fe"> That conclusion reflects agriculture’s central role in the developing world: in some of the least-developed countries, it accounts for <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview">more than 25% of GDP</a>, while 52% of employed people in Sub-Saharan Africa are <a href="https://unctad.org/news/blog-revitalizing-african-agriculture-time-bold-action">active in the sector</a>. Given this, achieving sustainable and climate-friendly food production in the Global South could lead to significant welfare improvements. This will require a shift to distributed renewable energy, which can be used in primary production, post-harvest processing, storage, and cooking – the agricultural activities that tend to consume the most energy in developing countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="9b8ecee4dcf24cdba7f385d49ca94acb"> To be sure, decentralized renewable energy is not a panacea. But it could contribute significantly to stabilizing the global food system by lowering energy costs, a crucial factor for boosting productivity; by facilitating financing for productive applications, which could democratize access to yield-enhancing technologies; and by reducing GHG emissions and promoting climate-change adaptation. Last but not least, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decentralizing energy production can help shift global power dynamics within the food system. </p>
<p data-line-id="b40e5fb3566e4c2bb66ab8591819ec2a"> Solar-powered irrigation, for example, has significantly improved water access and enabled multiple cropping cycles, increasing productivity and reducing GHG emissions. Solar-powered pumps have boosted farmers’ incomes by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/solar-water-pumps-critical-to-sustainable-agriculture-in-india/">more than 50% in India</a> and led to significant <a href="https://energy4impact.org/news/solar-irrigation-rwanda-%E2%80%93-developing-new-market-smallholder-farmers">increases in yields in Rwanda</a>. The Ethiopian Ministry of Irrigation and Lowlands – which one of us heads – recently <a href="https://www.esi-africa.com/energy-efficiency/ethiopia-to-replace-diesel-gas-water-pumps-with-solar-and-other-energy-sources/#:~:text=Ethiopia%20is%20to%20end%20the,that%20run%20with%20renewable%20energy.%E2%80%9D">banned</a> the import of diesel irrigation pumps to support the rapid transition to renewable-energy solutions. </p>
<p data-line-id="45e4b012f9814f64a28ec868fce51e49"> In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar milling machines could make grinding grain into flour more efficient, affordable, and sustainable. Additionally, the expansion of mini-grids to power post-harvest processes can bring more economic and environmental benefits by enabling communities to preserve their produce locally. </p>
<p data-line-id="caef78ee0c4c4037b1531f0b97ed4e19"> Cold storage and refrigeration are crucial for extending shelf life, reducing food loss, and maintaining product quality. Decentralized cold-storage solutions that are powered by renewable energy could improve market access and reduce spoilage for smallholder farmers and remote communities. By converting existing infrastructure to renewable energy sources, we can cut GHG emissions and make cold chains more environmentally friendly and affordable. </p>
<p data-line-id="e8834f8e02aa4e95a9f9df5cc804fa6e"> All the above examples demonstrate the diverse applications of distributed renewable energy, and each solution contributes to a more resilient, sustainable, and climate-friendly food system. By scaling up these innovations, we can address the energy challenges faced by smallholder farmers, processors, and consumers while reducing our carbon footprint. </p>
<p data-line-id="e2fea8362ea74c219d33885abaa4df50"> Reinforcing the fabric of our global food system requires a new framework designed to reduce land use, enhance productivity, minimize food loss, and cut GHG emissions. Renewable energy must be its foundation. Otherwise, developing countries will be unable to raise agricultural yields and end hunger, stop and reverse environmental degradation, or democratize energy access. </p>

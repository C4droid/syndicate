<p data-line-id="c469a81046d94075b7da08f5831bd98b"> CAMBRIDGE/MILAN – India’s recent economic success, solid momentum, and promising prospects are making the country ever more influential both regionally and internationally. But the experience of other countries – most notably China over the last three decades – suggests that such rapid influence and robust progress can be tricky to manage. After all, an action that makes sense domestically may conflict with what other countries expect from a systemically important economy. By the same token, actions that make sense internationally could complicate domestic economic progress. </p><p data-line-id="3ab8dcabd3b1477fb0acf97931910e6b"> Like China, India’s systemic importance has become apparent earlier in its growth and development process than was the case with other emerging economies, primarily because it boasts the world’s largest population (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/06/08/1180454049/india-is-now-the-worlds-most-populous-nation-and-thats-not-necessarily-a-bad-thi">over 1.4 billion</a>). Its growing presence is easy to detect. It is the world’s fifth-largest economy, and with an annual growth rate 5-6 percentage points above that of Germany and Japan, it could well move into third place in about four years.  </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly On Point newsletter" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-onpoint-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><figure data-line-id="df364c6ee763403a9d585b9cf7d4e0d9"><img src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/f5d55152d8e014a67478384fef03a380.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="2b24960fd0ac4bd8840587a1dd01fdd4"> Relative per capita incomes paint a different picture, however. India’s per capita GDP, at $2,389, is still far below the level of high-income economies, and remains considerably lower than that of China. In terms of overall economic size and income levels, India is roughly <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/CHN/china/gdp-per-capita#:~:text=China%20gdp%20per%20capita%20for,a%202.41%25%20increase%20from%202018.">where China was</a> in 2007, nearly a generation ago. </p><p data-line-id="e5a875ec2b954368ae680cd8a4fa8884"> Adjusting for differential price levels – the so-called purchasing-power-parity adjustment – lower and lower-middle-income countries tend to move up in relative size. With the PPP adjustment, India is already in third place, at about half the size of the US economy. </p><figure data-line-id="997017b919d14f119239b217ef35b25f"><img src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/86c4684c603507a067ebaa9bc7a3c1d2.jpg"/></figure><h2 data-line-id="b0fd60e9897d4626bb639ef81acd03e3"><strong>Poised for Continued Growth</strong></h2><p data-line-id="f2788be0c04d4dd48f061a04d26e5c24"> Carbon dioxide emissions, another dimension of global impact, paint a similar picture. India ranks behind only China and the United States in terms of overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. But this, again, is a function of its large population; its per capita emissions are still quite low, at 1.89 metric tons, well below the global average of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268753/co2-emissions-per-capita-worldwide-since-1990/#:~:text=Global%20per%20capita%20carbon%20dioxide%20emissions%20averaged%204.66%20metric%20tons%20in%202022.">4.66 metric tons</a>. </p><figure data-line-id="fae440efb9664710860cdfcf0af699fc"><img src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/02be2a91850505319797309ed3d3a2e8.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="7ae75d2f13334362b2826bd716ac30e8"> Moreover, India already has plans to reduce its emissions. The chart below, from a 2022 McKinsey Sustainability <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/decarbonizing%20india%20charting%20a%20pathway%20for%20sustainable%20growth/Decarbonising-India-Charting-a-pathway-for-sustainable-growth-ES-Oct-2022.pdf">report</a>, depicts alternate decarbonization pathways that it could take. The “line of sight” (LoS) scenario (the royal blue line) reflects the anticipated adoption of existing technologies, policies, and commitments that have already been implemented or announced, whereas the accelerated scenario captures further-reaching measures such as carbon pricing and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). </p><figure data-line-id="73cd9cd29eb145ccb7a0a63f9b46f4a9"><img src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/8cfe6dd9a72488c41a46af047cafd602.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="28d8d3c9527f4a878167148608598cde"> But even the LoS scenario seems very aggressive to us. With overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions peaking in the mid-2030’s, and with 7% annual growth in the interim, it will be achieved only if the carbon intensity of the economy declines at an equally rapid pace. But over the past decade, McKinsey notes, India’s carbon intensity declined at a rate of 1.3% per year. If India manages to stay on the LoS path, its per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would peak at 2.71 metric tons – something that has never been done before. It will be difficult to stay on this path, and India will most likely face growing sustainability-related global pressure, as has been the case for China. </p><p data-line-id="869a73ccd5bb49bda07ad30cc57f8ef4"> In the meantime, India’s urbanization, which is already moving at a steady, moderate pace, will likely pick up as more people pursue employment in industrial sectors. </p><figure data-line-id="feaec431d7834a8a9616b931b1447886"><img src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/5733f0a0cf60455dc1df911fa0d012cb.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="ff7e77ea22d84f32a837e0102e3d8f18"> China plays an important role in India’s recent growth story. Its high middle-income levels imply that it was destined eventually to shed labor-intensive manufacturing and assembly jobs. But that process has been accelerated by the rapid diversification of global supply chains, owing to various economic shocks and geopolitical developments. Most likely, there will be demand-side inducements for India to expand its tradable sector, with manufacturing for export providing employment opportunities for lower-income people in rural sectors. </p><p data-line-id="6f958d4f80c243edac5478a0c31f4632"> Apple, for example, is expanding iPhone assembly in India, in collaboration with partners like the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn. India already accounts for <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-iphone-production-in-india-tripled-to-7-bn-in-fy23/">7% of iPhone production</a>, and much of that is for export. That said, net foreign-direct-investment (FDI) flows into India <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-12/foreign-investment-into-india-tumbles-even-as-economy-booms?sref=GX0WPFvK">declined sharply</a> in the current fiscal year, and it remains to be seen whether there will be a wave of export-driven investment in manufacturing sectors. </p><p data-line-id="4ccb3313b1c74f199b08dc037ec1342a"> Finally, India also already has a thriving digital and financial sector. With a large and growing domestic economy, it has a natural advantage in large-scale digital innovation, owing to the fact that such technologies tend to have relatively high fixed costs, but low variable costs.  </p><p data-line-id="1ea696d120de429cb2626582e426388c"> As with manufacturing, recent developments in China bear on this issue. Owing to changes in China’s economic and governance model, along with its deteriorating relations with some advanced economies (most notably the US), external capital has been leaving, leading to an influx of capital into India. If not managed carefully, these inflows could complicate economic policymaking by impacting the currency and competitiveness. </p><h2 data-line-id="78a223dda5414f79a5554e2c95dedeea"><strong>Cautionary Tales</strong></h2><p data-line-id="9062e5c03f084acf9b356ca1b9944365"> With India expected to remain the world’s fastest-growing major economy, policymakers face the increasingly complex challenge of balancing external and internal interests, while still maintaining the country’s growth and development trajectory. Multinational corporations have also faced this dilemma when considering whether and how to change where they operate. Judging from the recent experience of Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, such changes can create many operational and reputational challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="2f90ed6963b846abb020d5bb7ed37ae8"> Whether the lesson comes from China or Big Tech, India should heed it. Recent history shows that the necessary internal course corrections, as well as the ability to shape international perceptions, can come late or be insufficient. As a result, a country’s (or a company’s) secular transformation can end up being more complicated than it needs to be. </p><p data-line-id="828eb76a06844390a9d1452006f718cc"> This is not just about India playing defense to manage the growing international expectations that come with increased regional and global influence. It is also about playing offense. The Indian economy is reaching the point where maintaining reliable access to international markets is not just valuable but also important as a development priority.  </p><p data-line-id="93c2eba993d6488ba1e0c3cd913cba50"> One of India’s major challenges is to avoid the error that both China and Big Tech made when they failed to recognize their newly acquired global influence and adapt accordingly. In China’s case, policymakers remained too narrowly focused on their domestic development agenda as the country was becoming more systemically important. By the time China woke up to the external realities associated with a growing global footprint, it was already getting serious pushback from other countries. These responses piled up and ultimately created major complications – including by exacerbating domestic challenges – which could now derail, or at least hamper, China’s impressive development journey. </p><p data-line-id="a5d5d506f9e942109eff770f9cfddadf"> Big Tech also did not anticipate the tipping point where the pursuit of its vision of exciting transformational innovations became a source of system-wide, global disruptions. Among the most vivid illustrations of this was Facebook’s failure to understand the potential for, and the need to counter, election interference in 2016. The scandals over how its platform was used during that febrile period triggered regulatory and political reactions that are yet to play out fully. </p><p data-line-id="7711162ed3b544c385410dd8456e3ae8"> Compared to these two cases, India’s vulnerability on the issue of climate change is particularly notable. While its per capita emissions are still low, it is already the third-biggest polluter in the world, and its overall emissions most likely will continue to increase.  </p><p data-line-id="50c31a008a354a66a51ba8a7d1ef40c5"> Meanwhile, its own multinationals are increasingly looking abroad for growth opportunities. The increased influx of foreign companies and other foreign investment flows will heighten the focus on domestic labor conditions, as will the larger volume of incoming FDI. India also is attracting more foreign portfolio capital, partly because more investors are growing worried about geopolitical tensions and the prospect of China’s economy becoming un-investable. </p><p data-line-id="77bd08a445664cf8a42851bcafad13c0"> India’s impressive recent technological successes will also add to its global systemic importance. Its thriving digital economy has allowed it to offer a superior open architecture for digital finance, making it a prime example of a massive country where money can move quickly and cheaply. Moreover, India’s multilingual technical capabilities are especially suitable for greater exports to many other countries undergoing similar technology-driven development. </p><h2 data-line-id="e83e4064f2f746f7b2f26e15bb8ff381"><strong>No Time to Waste</strong></h2><p data-line-id="a9f8dcf262da433da5f6618cb843450f"> Given India’s growing systemic importance across so many dimensions, current and future generations alike would benefit from early steps to minimize the risks and maximize the opportunities presented by a larger global footprint. The to-do list is rather long, but it starts with two critical priorities, one domestic and one international. </p>

<p data-line-id="c52321108e574be8be755e3d0c3108b4"> On the domestic front, India is on the cusp of an even greater inflow of FDI and portfolio investors. Such capital has many benefits, of course, including job creation, technology transfer, and greater access to cheaper funding.  </p><p data-line-id="d71fd320519848ef8056ac21c1e4a21f"> But as other countries’ experience shows, large inflows require rapid adaptation of policies and policymakers’ mindsets, as well as measures to overcome internal resistance from domestic incumbents. Otherwise, the benefits will be more than offset by the serious threat of macroeconomic instability, severe resource misallocation, excessive risk taking, and corruption. </p><p data-line-id="b5de81d8ccca483b883c138002b14dd0"> Looking outward, India needs to foster much deeper cooperative interactions with key bilateral trading partners, regional institutions, and international platforms. Its status as a founder of the New Development Bank – established by the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in 2014 – does not preclude the need for closer ties with the Asian Development Bank, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and other global institutions.  </p><p data-line-id="1c1351d4d0c14d6ea0be5afa6aa579d9"> While Indian policymakers naturally will focus on exciting domestic developments and accomplishments, they also must keep a close eye on how their country is influencing existing global alignments. The challenge is for India to make room for itself in as orderly a manner as possible. </p><p data-line-id="b5c3c67fb99946bab4f8eb10ea4e6259"> Given its success and outlook, India can no longer claim to be an economically small developing country with few global spillovers. Its growing systemic importance will bring a larger set of risks and opportunities. India today is near where China and Big Tech were before they inadvertently triggered reactions that have complicated their growth strategies and undermined their reputations. India must lose no time in managing its growing footprint, so that its domestic priorities align with international realities.   </p><p data-line-id="b1b3eefec85247e89e45a4aa07e40fc5"> When China was at a similar stage of economic development 16 years ago, it ran a current account surplus of <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/current-account-balance--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China%20Current%20Account%20Balance%3A%20%25%20of%20Nominal%20GDP%20data%20is%20updated,%2D1.8%20%25%20in%20Mar%202020.">10% of GDP</a>. With Chinese policymakers focused on the stock-market bubble in 2007, they ignored growing external concerns about mercantilism and “unfair” competition until it was too late. Now, the US and others have introduced tight trade, capital, and technology restrictions against China, most of which seem likely to remain in place indefinitely.  </p><p data-line-id="95db80d2e1864d6195f5a58b3fb30b17"> The lesson is that a purely reactive approach, with its inevitable delayed response, is much less effective than a balanced approach combining proactive and reactive elements. The current Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, appears to understand this, and has been generally praised for how it has navigated today’s highly complex and tense global environment. </p><p data-line-id="467a709ab44c44c2aba030dab31e4648"> But there is more work to be done. India should seek to play a larger role in the world’s multilateral institutions, where it could be a strong voice for constructive reform. For understandable reasons, India has stayed away from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. But like it or not, China and India are both destined to be giants in the global economy. The nature of their relations will have an enormous effect on the future of global integration and cooperation. Working gradually toward a more constructive relationship that is consistent with its other geopolitical priorities (including vis-à-vis the US), should be an objective for India. It is also a key element in both countries’ ability to manage their expanding global footprints. </p>

<p data-line-id="d72cdab460214f03aca0f4c31bd28e8e"> GENEVA – Groundbreaking new technologies seem to be emerging with increasing frequency nowadays. Since its launch in November 2022, OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT, has become a global sensation, attracting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948386/chatgpt-active-user-count-openai-developer-conference">more than 100 million users</a> and inspiring numerous imitators. The technology’s fast-evolving capabilities have also commanded the attention of world leaders, dominating discussions at both the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (<a href="https://unfccc.int/news/challenge-launched-at-cop28-to-harness-artificial-intelligence-for-climate-action-in-developing">COP28</a>) and the annual meeting of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-council-on-artificial-intelligence/">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos. </p><p data-line-id="769cc6ccc9e743688cbf0cec8c6aec9f"> It is not difficult to understand why. By harnessing AI tools developed by private companies like OpenAI, governments and civil-society organizations could make significant strides toward tackling global challenges like climate change and economic inequality. Similarly, they could revolutionize how we fight infectious diseases, ensuring that life-saving care reaches those who need it most. </p><p data-line-id="b36a587a8f0f4239845ab3e866b67405"> Tuberculosis is a prime example. TB, a preventable and curable disease, claims an average of more than 3,000 lives per day. Although the mechanisms of TB transmission are well understood, and highly effective treatment regimens – including new and improved medications – are available worldwide, TB still led to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis">1.3 million deaths</a> globally in 2022. </p><p data-line-id="32042be7b2774a1f8bc686760156211b"> AI tools could play a major role in the global effort to end TB. To this end, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is pursuing public-private partnerships with the goal of developing and deploying innovative digital public-health tools. During a recent trip to Bangladesh, for example, I encountered a team of health-care providers from the public and private sectors, along with local community partners, who are using digital X-rays, AI, and telemedicine to facilitate rapid TB screening. Patients whose X-ray results show signs of TB could immediately submit sputum samples for analysis and receive treatment at the community level, free of charge. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="58fafcd773a04735b417b34ee9f177cf"> Similar initiatives are being launched around the world. In Pakistan’s Punjab province, the humanitarian aid organization <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/">Mercy Corps</a> uses AI tools to identify “hot spots” – remote or rural areas where TB cases might go undetected – and set up mobile health camps to deliver diagnostic and treatment services directly to local residents. In the Padre de la Vega prison in Paraguay, health-care workers use Fujifilm ultralight portable X-ray machines and AI technology to provide rapid and precise TB screening. </p><p data-line-id="6fe9376bee5a45e5ad69345b817137a6"> Likewise, physicians at Cambodia’s National Center for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control in Phnom Penh bring portable Delft X-ray machines to nearby provinces to screen individuals unable to travel to the capital. And in Indonesia, a new partnership between the Global Fund, Siemens Healthineers, and the country’s national TB program aims to scale up early detection efforts by combining deep-learning AI technology and X-ray analysis to enable radiologists to read scans remotely. </p><p data-line-id="1b1b6e0f8f264439a0e8dc8d6d0691b5"> Targeted, innovative projects such as these are crucial to overcoming persistent inequities that fuel the spread of infectious diseases: poverty, conflict- and weather-related displacement, overcrowding, and limited access to health facilities. Moreover, they are laying the groundwork for resilient health systems capable of meeting every person’s needs. For example, in addition to TB screenings, Pakistan’s mobile health camps offer essential services focusing on women and young children. </p><p data-line-id="d9aad7a8362745bb97c5e22cb7dfa719"> These examples underscore the importance of fostering collaboration among companies, industry leaders, governments, and local health providers to devise innovative ways to address solvable problems like TB. That is why the Global Fund, which <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/tuberculosis/">contributes</a> 76% of all international financing to end TB, also allocates more than <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/digital-health/">$150 million annually</a> to develop digital tools aimed at promoting equity and helping remote communities access critical health-care services. </p><p data-line-id="e6eff6a3b3db47e0a288311469394d53"> But much more is needed. Devising targeted, effective, and sustainable solutions requires active engagement with local communities to mitigate a wide range of other public-health threats, such as pandemics and antimicrobial resistance. This is why it is crucial to have committed partners who can envision and develop cutting-edge digital tools. </p><p data-line-id="b06fed6ab917498e8d1db2cf674f9a27"> By leveraging AI to augment local medical expertise, we have an opportunity to overcome TB once and for all. In a world brimming with innovative ideas and emerging technologies that until recently were beyond our imagination, ending this global scourge, and perhaps others, is finally within reach. </p>

<p data-line-id="084251a32c4a4599b3b8e773ab59f5f8"> CAMBRIDGE – Last week, the United States House of Representatives <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/house-passes-tiktok-ban-bill-1235939822/">passed</a> the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. It is no secret that the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/BILLS-118hr7521eh">bill</a> takes aim at TikTok. The massively popular video-sharing platform is owned by Beijing-based <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/tech/tiktok-bytedance-china-ownership-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Definitely.,the%20Chinese%20capital%20since%20then.">ByteDance</a> and thus subject to the laws of the People’s Republic of China, and potentially to the control of the Communist Party of China (CPC), despite <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-au/the-truth-about-tiktok">assurances</a> to the contrary from company executives. </p><p data-line-id="b2e288dac7fe489995e660fdbe2127ec"> If the Senate approves the bill, and US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> signs it into law (as he has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/76faa51d-f91a-4fdb-a6c9-c528529c8213">said</a> he would), ByteDance would be forced to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company within six months or be banned from US app stores. The reasoning, according to the legislation’s bipartisan sponsors, which include the chair and ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, is that TikTok undermines democracy and threatens national security by allowing China to “<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-bipartisan-coalition-introduce-legislation-protect-americans-0">surveil and influence the American public</a>.” </p><p data-line-id="85c9b677d8f045ca85f8eebe2de62911"> To be sure, TikTok poses risks to American users. But the app is only one small part of a much larger problem: the lack of an affirmative model of data privacy that protects privacy and civil liberties. By targeting TikTok, US policymakers are merely boosting the company’s competitors while sapping momentum from the push for effective data and algorithmic transparency regulations. </p>

Health care is a critical link between citizens and their governments, and trust in a country’s health system often translates into confidence in government and other public institutions. </p><p data-line-id="0eef01c3c8c44df48e9881ce0fc73b6d"> Ukraine’s government has adopted a series of important <a href="https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/796791611679539176/Reforms-in-the-Health-Sector-in-Ukraine.pdf">health-care reforms</a> since 2017. Still, the country must go further to modernize care, meet European standards, and respond effectively to the complex demands of a conflict environment. For example, while recent reforms entitle citizens to receive many <a href="https://en.moz.gov.ua/what-services-do-patients-pay-for">free health-care services</a> at their local health facilities, with the costs covered by the National Health Service of Ukraine (NHSU), displaced people confront uncertain access to care. </p>

<p data-line-id="26b8d0d961474aa7ad29ed7a3c17d5d7"> LONDON – In 2003, the literary critic Fredric Jameson <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii21/articles/fredric-jameson-future-city">famously observed</a> that “it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.” For the first time in two centuries, he noted, capitalism was viewed as both destructive and irreversible. Waning faith in the possibility of a post-capitalist future has nurtured deep pessimism. </p><p data-line-id="69be833dd1794a56b4c98cb80dc22722"> This prevailing despair evokes John Maynard Keynes’s 1930 essay “<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_and_Section_I.pdf">Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren</a><em>,</em>” in which he warned against the “two opposed errors of pessimism.” The first was the pessimism “of the revolutionaries who think that things are so bad that nothing can save us but violent change.” The second was the pessimism of reactionaries who view economic and social structures as “so precarious that we must risk no experiments.” </p><p data-line-id="e7292db3166042d286d4755c513ff86f"> In response to the pessimisms of his time, Keynes offered an alternative vision, predicting that technology would usher in an era of unprecedented abundance. Within a century, he argued, continuous technological progress would elevate living standards – at least in the “civilized” world – to 4-8 times what they were in the 1920s. This would enable his generation’s grandchildren to work a fraction of the hours their ancestors did. </p>

<p data-line-id="3dab3d4bb9944e6085e1cfe89dd2b678"> BRUSSELS – Dozens of countries around the world, from the United States to India, will hold or have already held elections in 2024. While this may seem like a banner year for democracy, these elections are taking place against a backdrop of global economic instability, geopolitical shifts, and intensifying climate change, leading to widespread uncertainty. </p><p data-line-id="60e127d725754821bd66d7a7f3c3ff7c"> Underpinning all this uncertainty is the rapid emergence of powerful new technologies, some of which are already reshaping markets and recalibrating global power dynamics. While they have the potential to solve global problems, they could also disrupt economies, endanger civil liberties, and undermine democratic governance. As Thierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/geopolitics-technology-thierry-breton/">observed</a>, “We have entered a global race in which the mastery of technologies is central” to navigating the “new geopolitical order.” </p><p data-line-id="22a8b24b4f1045ccb58059635bb2fd09"> To be sure, technological disruption is not a new phenomenon.

<p data-line-id="9bc9cec5900348ec826d115e8a3e3ba3"> BRATISLAVA – Central and Eastern European (CEE) governments have long prided themselves on their tough migration policies. Over the past decades, many of the region’s political leaders have focused their efforts on curbing the flow of migrants and asylum seekers, contending that an influx of third-country nationals would undermine social stability, threaten cultural cohesion, and even pose a security risk. </p><p data-line-id="6049aa4d9d9a4dfd9a5bd91cf0542bf5"> For example, in 2015, at the height of the European Union’s migration crisis, the four Visegrád (V4) countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) vehemently <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/refugee-crisis-european-court-of-justice-rejects-quota-challenge/a-40375192">opposed</a> the bloc’s refugee-quota system, which aimed to share the burden by allocating a certain number of asylum seekers to each EU country based on population, GDP, and other factors. Hungary and Slovakia were among the most vocal critics of the plan, arguing that mandatory quotas were an attack on national sovereignty. </p><p data-line-id="89a292ed444943e1b61571560ee77596"> To be sure, CEE countries – most notably, Poland and the Czech Republic – <a href="https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/CESifo-Forum-2022-4-aslund-ukrainian-refugee-crisis-july.pdf">welcomed millions of Ukrainians</a> driven out of their homes by the Russian invasion in 2022. But despite this generosity, V4 leaders have continued to take a tough line on migration. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/religions/article/2023/04/29/how-viktor-orban-went-from-being-an-agnostic-liberal-to-a-defender-of-christian-values_6024781_63.html">self-declared champion</a> of Europe’s Christian values – <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/orban-calls-ethnic-homogeneity-a-key-to-success/">promotes a vision</a> of a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hungary-orban-mixed-race-society-racism-backlash-rcna40583">homogeneous Hungarian society</a>. Hungary granted refugee status to only <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/migration/news/double-game-migrants-pour-through-orbans-hungary/">ten individuals</a> in 2022, earning a rebuke from the EU’s top court. In Slovakia, Prime Minister Robert Fico’s left-populist Smer-Social Democracy party won last year’s election by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aea63b5f-6169-4db3-935d-deb09214dabc">exploiting resentment</a> against Ukrainian refugees. And the region recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-interior-ministers-migration-hungary-78fa8ebff89711b751257d81a1a63fb3">stepped up efforts</a> to stop illegal immigration through the Balkans by introducing stricter controls and deploying security forces to patrol borders. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4afcd04ef7742eaac3062e1f81afc46"> AUCKLAND/RIGA/LONDON – If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that no one is safe anywhere until everyone is safe everywhere, and that delivering global safety is possible only through collaboration. It was with this in mind that the World Health Organization’s 194 member countries decided in December 2021 to <a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/inb/pdf_files/inb5/A_INB5_6-en.pdf">negotiate</a> a convention, agreement, or other international instrument that would support pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response globally. With the deadline for those negotiations approaching fast – the “pandemic accord” is supposed to be delivered in time for the 77th World Health Assembly in May – it is worth considering what is at stake. </p><p data-line-id="603df792bd084b6397b362b4eccb5a42"> A pandemic accord is critical to safeguard our collective future. Only a strong global pact on pandemics can protect future generations from a repeat of the COVID-19 crisis, which led to millions of deaths and caused widespread social and economic devastation, owing not least to insufficient international collaboration. </p><p data-line-id="1438e57a52e047c0b56fb12e5e933647"> But the global effort to deliver such an accord is being threatened by <a href="https://betterworldcampaign.org/other-issues/who-pandemic-accord">misinformation and disinformation</a>. Among the falsehoods that have been circulating is the claim that the pandemic accord would enable the WHO to exert far-reaching authority over countries and their citizens during a public-health emergency.  </p><p data-line-id="75ecd3aa32044aeb93401f111e147099"> Some allege, for example, that the WHO could require the adoption of digital vaccine passports that would enable it to monitor – and control – people’s movements. Others say that it would interfere in matters of national sovereignty. There are even some who worry that the WHO would deploy armed forces to enforce vaccination orders and lockdowns. </p><p data-line-id="c56122f5d26342939b12dc2f903fcd6b"> All of these claims are wholly false. For starters, the deployment of a WHO-led armed force to ensure compliance would fall well outside the organization’s mandate. Moreover, while the pandemic accord is a global pact, individual countries are spearheading it. Sovereign countries proposed it, are negotiating it, will determine what is in it, and will decide whether it succeeds or fails. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="32f791e300a34a318d52ef4ca90e3aef"> Countries are doing this not because of some dictum from the WHO – like the negotiations, participation in any instrument would be entirely voluntary – but because they need what the accord can and must offer. In fact, a pandemic accord would deliver vast and universally shared benefits, including greater capacity to detect new and dangerous pathogens, access to information about pathogens detected elsewhere in the world, and timely and equitable delivery of tests, treatments, vaccines, and other lifesaving tools. </p><p data-line-id="e0319a5995fb4029b8c72c21131166f6"> As countries enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, governments must work to refute and debunk false claims about the accord. At the same time, negotiators must ensure that the agreement lives up to its promise to prevent and mitigate pandemic-related risks. This requires, for example, provisions aimed at ensuring that when another pandemic threat does arise, all relevant responses – from reporting the identification of risky pathogens to delivering tools like tests and vaccines on an equitable basis – are implemented quickly and effectively. As the COVID-19 pandemic showed, collaboration between the public and private sectors focused on advancing the public good is also essential. </p><p data-line-id="ae97cc27c310428892eec3b3313a1b91"> A new pandemic threat will emerge; there is no excuse not to be ready for it. It is thus imperative to build an effective, multisectoral, and multilateral approach to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Given the unpredictable nature of public-health risks, a global strategy must embody a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. There is no time to waste, which is why we are calling on all national leaders to redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline. </p><p data-line-id="476479c6f8604ab69424969fecfacafd"> Beyond protecting countless lives and livelihoods, the timely delivery of a global pandemic accord would send a powerful message: even in our fractured and fragmented world, international cooperation can still deliver global solutions to global problems. </p><p data-line-id="e38b2cfd34094f2c86ea26f4f268d47b"><em>This commentary is signed by Carlos Alvarado, President of Costa Rica (2018-22); Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile (2006-10); Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister of the Netherlands (2002-10); Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; Joyce Banda, President of Malawi (2012-14); Kjell Magne Bondevik, Prime Minister of Norway (1997-2000, 2001-05); Kim Campbell, Prime Minister of Canada (1993); Alfred Gusenbauer, Chancellor of Austria (2007-08); Seung-Soo Han, Prime Minister of South Korea (2009-09); Mehdi Jomaa, Prime Minister of Tunisia (2014-15); Horst Köhler, President of Germany (2004-10); Rexhep Meidani, President of Albania (1997-2002); Mario Monti, Prime Minister of Italy (2011-13); Francisco Sagasti, President of Peru (2020-21); Jenny Shipley, Prime Minister of New Zealand (1997-99); Juan Somavía, former Director of the International Labour Organization; Micheline Calmy-Rey, former President of the Swiss Confederation; Baroness Lynda Chalker, former Minister of Overseas Development, UK; Chester A.

<p data-line-id="ddc3cc7d662d4f78a0caed998256455d"> NEW YORK – On March 8, the United Nations Security Council <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147432">passed a resolution</a> calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the holy month of Ramadan. It also urged all parties to the conflict to ensure the rapid and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including to protect civilians. </p><p data-line-id="62f4cae0d4144eb4945737d8835bcf08"> The violent conflict, which erupted last April following a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/15/army-and-rival-forces-clash-as-power-struggle-rocks-sudan">standoff</a> between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a powerful paramilitary group, has since <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2024/02/19/sudan-collapse-international-community-we-are-failing-it">engulfed</a> more than half the country. Nearly a year later, the Security Council’s push for a ceasefire and the free flow of aid is an essential step forward, following increasingly <a href="https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20231218/auc-chairperson-renews-call-end-conflict-sudan">urgent</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-war-guterres-generals-icc-atrocities-fffe37935dacf91287f001a8696488c3">calls</a> for an immediate halt to the fighting from the African Union and UN Secretary-General <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a>. Now, policymakers must translate words into action. </p><p data-line-id="42091919dfb84808adb56b6cb75219d7"> The situation in Sudan is catastrophic. Half the population – <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/press-releases/sudan-conflict-fuels-epic-suffering-un-launches-humanitarian-and-refugee">25 million people</a> – are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. According to the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146167">UN World Food Programme</a>, nearly 18 million people are facing acute hunger – more than double this time last year – and must make impossible decisions to feed themselves, while nearly five million (equivalent to the population of Ireland) are on the brink of famine. Since the conflict began, more than <a href="https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan/">eight million people</a> have been displaced. In December, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity-and-ethnic-cleansing-determination-in-sudan/">issued a determination</a> that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing were occurring in Sudan, evoking ominous echoes of the Darfur genocide. </p>

<div class="question" data-line-id="34aaa7130357442d9b8041b63122229c"><p><strong><em>Project Syndicate:</em></strong><em> In 2020, Chinese regulators launched a </em><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/an-interview-with-angela-huyue-zhang-2022-02"><em>crackdown</em></a><em> on tech companies – a process that cost firms more than $1 trillion in market value.

Beyond failing to encourage new market entrants, it seems to have entrenched the dominance of incumbents. Moreover, it has severely undermined investor confidence, leading to a substantial reduction in capital flows into the consumer-tech sector. </p><p data-line-id="1c82f267ca9c4c6c967697f0c2c08975">As private entities recede, the state advances. For example, government-backed funds or companies acquire stakes in key subsidiaries of tech giants; these “golden shares” enable the government to exert more control over content moderation and other business decisions. Finally, the crackdown has enabled the state to steer investment within the technology sector, leading both private and state-backed investors increasingly to focus on so-called <a href="https://www.mhubchicago.com/blog/what-is-hardtech">hard tech</a>.</p>

<p data-line-id="6cdac0ad06d644639e85b5596d812466"> SAN DIEGO – If John D. Rockefeller were around today, he’d be screwing a Google Nest – the pioneering smart thermostat – into the wall of his home. The notoriously thrifty oil baron would have jumped at the chance to save on his monthly energy bill. </p>
<p data-line-id="10dfcd935b19403da46b03786013d741"> Traditional energy companies, from ExxonMobil (the direct descendent of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company) to local utilities, have begun to embrace Big Tech, brimming with both hope and trepidation. Will companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta put the meter reader and his bosses out to pasture? Who wins if they do? </p>
<p data-line-id="f94a803711fe408aa3c56613d6256f72"> Big Tech has already shown a propensity to disrupt. Just 25 years ago, a “<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/on-google-s-22nd-birthday-learn-how-the-name-came-from-word-googol-1726205-2020-09-28#:~:text=The%20name%20Google%20came%20from,number%20that%20had%20100%20zeros.">googol</a>” – the inspiration for the search engine’s name – was an unfathomably large number, a cloud was a billowing puff in the sky, and 5G was the row in which you parked your car at the garage. In the intervening decades, tech companies have upended industries both at the enterprise and retail levels. </p>
<p data-line-id="1ba92b26a8a943d28638fe90222745fa"> Consider pharmacies, which relied on the patience of shoppers to wait days for a prescription and stand in queues to retrieve them. Now companies like <a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss">Hims</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss">Hers</a> will confidentially overnight drugs to calm your nerves, grow your hair, or put you in the mood. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/amazon-closes-39b-buy-of-one-medical/643245/#:~:text=Amazon%20completed%20its%20%243.9%20billion,addition%20of%20physical%20medical%20clinics.">One Medical</a>, which Amazon purchased last year, offers 24-hour on-demand virtual care and same- and next-day appointments – quite a feat considering the average wait time to see a physician in major American cities is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/30/medical-appointments-avoiding-long-waits/">more than three weeks</a>. No wonder the profit margins of brick-and-mortar drugstores have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/22/drugstore-close-pharmacy-deserts/">fallen</a>, plunging Rite-Aid into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rite-pharmacy-bankruptcy-f80c3d231946d675b03e4e797f627fa6">bankruptcy</a>. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="a36e4a6c32e0437aba13e474f173a35e"> Just as the world needs better access to medical care, it also needs more efficient and reliable power. Too many people are sitting in the dark too often, and for too long. Even in developed countries like the United States, the average duration of a blackout doubled <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/increasing-power-outages-dont-hit-everyone-equally1/">between 2013 and 2021</a>, from 3.5 hours to more than seven hours, while their frequency jumped by nearly 20%. Not surprisingly, Americans are taking a dimmer view of their local utilities, with 71% saying they would <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/electric-power-and-natural-gas/our-insights/the-digital-utility-new-opportunities-and-challenges">switch</a> providers, while businesses complain that power outages cost them <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/department-energy-report-explores-us-advanced-small-modular-reactors-boost-grid">$150 billion</a> per year. </p>
<p data-line-id="a51056c4b2fe43b59b291536b0fd7ab0"> That doesn’t mean utilities deserve all the blame. In the US, local and state politicians and regulators dictate profits and prices, while delaying capital upgrades. The US Department of Energy spends around five years assessing a new project before approval, leaving roughly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/06/outdated-us-energy-grid-tons-of-clean-energy-stuck-waiting-in-line.html">2,000 gigawatts</a> of annual capacity waiting in the queue. </p>
<p data-line-id="b88402f702324c2db526a412bb92ffb0"> Fast-growing trillion-dollar tech companies cannot afford to lose power, so they are taking matters into their own hands. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-renewable-energy-portfolio-january-2024-update">clean-energy portfolio</a>, which comprises solar and wind projects in more than 20 US states and 27 countries, is now big enough to power 7.2 million American homes each year. In Nevada’s Blue Mountain geothermal field, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/">partnering</a> with clean-energy start-up Fervo to power the tech behemoth’s data centers by tapping the heat trapped below Jurassic rocks. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c3be64a5ca84b22afed995b76a22872"> Unlike a utility saddled with old plants that need to be decommissioned, tech companies can start anew. The average age of an oil-burning steam-turbine plant in the Midwest is <a href="https://www.powermag.com/americas-aging-generation-fleet/">pushing 70 years</a>. In fact, Whiting, Wisconsin, runs a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydropower/">hydropower facility</a> built in 1891 – 40 years before actor Boris Karloff was hooked up to lightning-conducting electrodes in the original <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021884/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4"><em>Frankenstein</em></a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="b01ffe5b766249f69faacc12e5a68700"> Although self-interest motivated tech companies to create new power supplies, they have their sights set on residential consumers. Fortunately, Big Tech is already welcome in the home. Amazon evolved from delivering brown boxes of books to answering questions with Alexa and recording doorbell activity with Ring cameras. </p>
<p data-line-id="eef8f15fdaa24b07abc8e730c566cd5c"> Google recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-14/google-backed-company-merges-with-software-firm-to-help-electric-grid">merged</a> Nest Renew, its service to help users optimize their electricity usage, with the software business OhmConnect to align the energy consumption of households across the country. The new company, Renew Home, will pay people to lower their thermostats and turn off their lights during peak hours or even, when combined with artificial intelligence-enabled weather forecasting, before lightning storms strike. </p>
<p data-line-id="eb1f7b2db969495d9a39b5113a0b9182"> Executives at traditional electric utilities should respond to these free-wheeling, free-spending technical wizards by rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>The Godfather, Part II</em></a>, and heeding mob boss Michael Corleone’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfHJDLoGInM">advice</a>: “keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” At the same time, they should focus on communicating better with their customers. Has your utility ever sent you a newsletter, a movie link, or a dozen roses? Or does it come to mind only when you have a complaint, whether about the lights going off or a meter reader skulking in the backyard? </p>
<p data-line-id="b43dc7352e2b471584e17a6227c1fc9b"> Lastly, utilities should work with Big Tech to boost efficiency. A few weeks ago, Southern Company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-collaborate-samsung-smartthings-163000522.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC-umvmyeot9ZpbiehyKM5f_0CB0iJXppk__ogq4THscRpnTrCMz9FLiuRv8IIzQj-CKL0QmOwVaLEnQZer8Id9f7Te4nlUCHR8CvMbcQNqH3MUzvTYLG0GSZt7h4UqUDhKSYZsM7EIN7o9KgVirj_R55WkLxi8BxIAJrnz365NL">announced</a> a deal with Samsung SmartThings to create an innovation laboratory aimed at prodding communication among smart refrigerators, dishwashers, and garage-door openers in an effort to save power. In San Diego, the utility company Sempra is <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/17/sdge-toyota-join-forces-on-vehicle-to-grid-research-in-california/">partnering</a> with Fermata Energy so that electric vehicles can sell their battery power back to the grid when demand peaks. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0751893b90548cb873ae3d1b7ed57f6"> Ever since the age of Rockefeller and Thomas Edison, utilities were the Steady Eddies of investments, the clichéd favorite of dividend-seeking widows and other risk-averse investors. Whether or not the climate is getting warmer, the sector is getting hotter. And as Big Tech enters, sparks are beginning to fly. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4ea29a82d184483b8fb8839a2573f60"> NEW HAVEN – Multilateralism is waning, and one of the world’s leading multilateral institutions, the World Trade Organization, is in crisis, because the United States has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1LC19N/">blocking</a> new appointments to its dispute settlement mechanism’s Appellate Body since 2018. In the run-up to the WTO’s 13th Ministerial Conference last month, some optimists hoped to see progress on specific issues, such as an agreement not to impose tariffs on digital commerce, but expectations were generally low. </p><p data-line-id="ef332c1b230a44be9e2d35c40889c476"> The pessimists were right. India led the charge against extending a moratorium on e-commerce tariffs, and only a last-minute deal prolonged it for another two years. After that, it is expected to expire. India and its allies celebrated the outcome as a victory. For the first time in years, the culprit undermining the WTO was not the US but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-08/world-trade-organization-s-death-is-a-momentous-error?srnd=opinion">developing countries</a> (including Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, and others).  </p><p data-line-id="e8c46f84261d4061b1cf2d99550a495d"> True, what happened with digital commerce is characteristic of the usual conflicts that play out during trade negotiations. Free trade always produces winners and losers. Digital commerce may be in the interest of businesses in advanced economies as well as consumers and businesses in low- and middle-income countries; users of an app, game, or other software product made in a different country may pay lower prices in the absence of tariffs. But domestic producers will reliably demand protection from imports, and governments will see tariffs as a promising way to boost revenues. </p>

<p data-line-id="a6c28659f26442ccab94e03fa58c3097"> NEW YORK – Last year, US President Joe Biden’s administration infuriated lobbyists representing Big Tech firms and others that profit from our personal data by denouncing a proposal that would have gutted domestic data privacy, online civil rights and liberties, and competition safeguards. Now, Biden’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/28/executive-order-on-preventing-access-to-americans-bulk-sensitive-personal-data-and-united-states-government-related-data-by-countries-of-concern/">executive order</a> on Americans’ data security reveals that the lobbyists had good reason to worry. </p><p data-line-id="2f0329cb5f034820841b1ff12f1562e8"> After decades of data brokers and tech platforms exploiting Americans’ personal data without any oversight or restrictions, the Biden administration has announced that it will ban the transfer of certain kinds of data to China and other countries of concern. It is a small, but important, step toward protecting Americans’ sensitive personal information, in addition to government-related data. </p><p data-line-id="4895f7854b6844a785941b0c686f6f4d"> Moreover, the order is likely a precursor to additional policy responses. Americans are rightly worried about what is happening online, and their concerns extend well beyond privacy violations to a host of other digital harms, such as mis- and disinformation, social media-induced teenage anxiety, and racial incitement. </p>

<p data-line-id="dc977491c7ab4dcd81600531493e5753"> LJUBLJANA – The way <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/haiti-gangs-seize-control-us-canada-latin-america-do-nothing-by-jorge-heine-1-2024-03">things are going</a> in Haiti, violent gangs might not only gain an official government role; they might actually <em>become</em> the government. Following the gangs’ seizure of critical infrastructure and the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, Haiti is exhibiting all the familiar features of a failed state. Its people are left with a tragic choice: continued rule by a corrupt “democratic” elite, or direct rule by gangs who present themselves as “progressive.” </p><p data-line-id="86ae9f2697db4448aa71fcf7fe53781e"> With law and order having collapsed, CARICOM, the Caribbean regional intergovernmental organization, has <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/haiti-gang-violence-rescue-plans/">announced</a> an agreement to create a transitional council aimed at representing a wide swath of Haitian political and civil-society groupings. The council would wield some powers that typically belong to the (vacant) office of the president, including the power to name an interim prime minister. The resulting government would be expected eventually to hold elections, thus achieving a complete political reset. </p><p data-line-id="a17c7cbeb0904df9960b322cc5390857"> But whom will these new arrangements include? Haiti has been under a state of emergency since armed groups attacked the country’s largest prison earlier this month, killing and injuring police and prison staff, and allowing nearly 4,000 inmates to escape. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/03/world/haiti-gang-violence-cnnphotos/">gang leader</a> Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier – himself a former police officer – took credit for the attack and called for the government to be overthrown. Gangs now control 80% of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, having seized the country’s main airport to block Henry’s return from a diplomatic mission to Kenya, where he was hoping to secure police reinforcements. </p>

<p data-line-id="bfe89aa7f3174f31b41a70846eb66bf0"> COPENHAGEN – With the approach of June’s European Parliament elections, the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/executive-education/insights/articles/can-a-centre-right-coalition-emerge-after-the-next-eu-elections">grand coalition</a> of the European People’s Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), and Renew Europe faces a watershed moment. The EPP’s recent decision to nominate European Commission President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a> for a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-von-der-leyen-commission-0fd8783553685657b2d8364f5a2a9082">second term</a>, far from being merely procedural, could have profound implications for Europe as it confronts internal and external challenges of unprecedented magnitude. </p>
<p data-line-id="3256381a89e54d07b4791d6b958f60bc"> Together with its coalition partners, the EPP has steered the EU through multiple shocks over the past five years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened tensions with China, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent energy crisis. The EU’s achievements during this period have highlighted not only the bloc’s resilience of the European community but also the crucial role of unity and the need to preserve the current coalition. </p>
<p data-line-id="01739420b9f24e969aa66774e636e4f5"> Moreover, these challenges have underscored the importance of upholding the intergenerational contract and foundational values that underpin the EU. This is particularly important in the face of mounting pressures from extremists and populists who advocate simplistic, short-term fixes instead of tackling long-term, complex challenges. </p>
<p data-line-id="8fde870dfd214544947fd5fbfe921c2c"> Looking ahead, the EU’s agenda will likely remain dominated by persistent crises, necessitating a unified and thoughtful approach. The EPP-led coalition could play a crucial role, fostering stability and economic development while navigating the challenges Europe must face. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="7f0ff87080ff4bbd91aa5906cdfe2711"> One of the main challenges will be the fight against climate change. Over the past few years, European leaders have worked together to protect the environment for future generations while striving to boost economic competitiveness.<strong> </strong>This collective effort has led to a significant reduction in transport-sector emissions and the adoption of the ambitious <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/green-deal/fit-for-55-the-eu-plan-for-a-green-transition/">Fit for 55</a> plan, a comprehensive legislative package aimed at reducing the EU’s net greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030. The plan includes binding targets for boosting renewable-energy production, reducing energy consumption, and lowering emissions in key industries. </p>
<p data-line-id="0e6543f36d3b4005927ca425f3b9e633"> Moreover, today’s geopolitical crises have brought security back to the top of Europe’s agenda, with EU member states aiming to <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/international-cooperation/global-targets-renewables-and-energy-efficiency_en">de-risk energy value chains</a> by focusing on renewables and efficiency measures. This strategic pivot reflects a broader commitment to sustainability that resonates beyond Europe’s borders, influencing energy policies around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="34c48795108d477d93ff23e7842b375c"> But this shift is not just about achieving climate goals. By focusing on renewable energies and de-risking supply chains, the EU also aims to shield European citizens and industries from the volatility of global energy markets, which are often influenced by geopolitical uncertainties. The bloc’s commitment to renewables is exemplified by Germany’s <a href="https://www.bmwk-energiewende.de/EWD/Redaktion/EN/Newsletter/2015/01/Meldung/topthema-the-energy-transition.html#:~:text=%22Energiewende%2C%22%20the%20energy%20transition,power%2C%20towards%20renewable%20energy%20sources."><em>Energiewende</em></a> (energy transformation) policy, as well as robust government investments in renewable energy in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden. These strategic investments have also bolstered the competitiveness of these countries’ energy industries. </p>
<p data-line-id="319436974a174058b4476406de4ecff2"> This is important because Europe is not alone in pursuing a sustainable future. Following the establishment of the EU’s <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en">Emissions Trading System</a>, countries like <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/equities/carbon-credit/index.html">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a7b017a-c54e-48e8-8c86-0654ed63979b">Brazil</a> have set up their own carbon markets. This global sustainability drive, while commendable, also means increased competition, again highlighting the need for unity as European countries seek to capitalize on the opportunities created by the green transition while striving to meet ambitious climate targets and tackle the complex challenges that come with implementation. </p>
<p data-line-id="1fc7b895e7e44a85a6f25eab4013f9c0"> While unity is the EU’s greatest asset in the fight against climate change, the EPP’s leadership, in particular, must continue to play a central role in advancing the EU’s climate agenda. This is no time to backtrack. The expansion of the EU carbon market into new sectors like maritime transport, and the bloc’s prominent role in international climate negotiations, are prime examples of its proactive approach. Faced with the existential threat of climate change, EPP, S&amp;D, and Renew leaders must draw on their experience, knowledge, and ambition to defend the bloc’s core values against rising populism and guide Europe through the challenging times ahead. </p>
<p data-line-id="c90cda5a9df34b33901ae24402394d16"> Far from a distant threat, climate change is already wreaking havoc across Europe. At this critical juncture, Europe requires unity, vision, and bold leadership more than ever. The future of the bloc, the welfare of its citizens, and the success of its industries are in our hands. For responsible political parties, now is no time to make Europe a victim of partisan paralysis. </p>

<p data-line-id="cee2d79562884f4096bab70e875b051b"> CHICAGO – It is becoming increasingly apparent that immigration will be a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx">major issue</a> for voters in this year’s US presidential election. Since President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> took office in 2021, more than <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters">6.2 million</a> people who did not have permission to enter the United States have attempted to cross the border from Mexico, and more than <a href="https://cis.org/Arthur/Bidens-Released-Least-2020522-Southwest-Border-Migrants">two million</a> have been allowed to remain while they await an immigration hearing. </p><p data-line-id="315071d4df1c4f51898c1523f7b04a04"> This marked <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/02/11/trump-biden-immigration-border-compared/">increase</a> from previous years has become a major source of controversy. While Biden’s critics <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-claims-migrant-crime-wave-are-not-supported-national-data-rcna140896">claim</a> – <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/29/truth-about-illegal-immigration-crime/">dubiously</a> – that immigrants are driving up crime rates and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/03/06/trump-warns-gop-on-immigration-theyre-taking-your-jobs/">taking</a> Americans’ jobs, some Democrats are doubling down on calls to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/border-crossing-decriminalization.html">decriminalize</a> illegal border crossings altogether. The first group accuses the second of undermining <a href="https://lamborn.house.gov/issues/illegal-immigration">national security</a>, while advocates of decriminalization accuse immigration hardliners of <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democrats-border-bill-wrong/">racism</a> and xenophobia. With Americans arguably more divided than at any time <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/10/politics-stress-swing-states-elections/671729/">since the Civil War</a>, US politicians are peddling simplistic rhetoric about an immensely complex issue to stoke fear and anger, deepening the country’s political polarization. </p><p data-line-id="cf9f514940bc47a492a59d8c2ff7ee2b"> But there is good news for the American people: The truth about immigration is far less frightening than what some politicians and media figures want you to believe. For starters, immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than US citizens. Nationwide, illegal immigrants tend to be incarcerated at a much <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep24844?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">lower rate</a> than native-born Americans. In Texas, for example, illegal immigrants, in 2018, were <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-10/working-paper-60.pdf">45%</a> less likely to be convicted of a crime than native-born Americans. And the crime and incarceration rates for legal immigrants are even lower. </p>

<p data-line-id="7ff3fde717694fab9e274eda52bc4a7b"> PRINCETON – Among her final acts as chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel requested that her colleagues endorse the two people <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/08/rnc-trump-allies-leadership-2024">handpicked</a> by Donald Trump to replace her. Following loud cheering, she announced that she would not even bother to ask if there were any “nays.” It was a telling moment: procedures meant to ensure a democratic process within the party were entirely replaced by acclamation. </p><p data-line-id="5bd8ab32285e40c5a981cdeff22bdf28"> Trump is hardly the only far-right populist leader to have subjugated a political party to his will. The hijacking of a party’s machinery is a common pattern among populists and would-be autocrats, and history shows that it can have truly dire consequences for a democratic political system. After all, turning your party into an autocracy is a logical first step toward turning your country into one. </p><p data-line-id="674c3a4804f24f7ab6b1cb04bb474333"> True, appeals for democracy and pluralism within political parties can sound like idealism. Endless, exhausting, pedantic debates usually result in a “victory” for the most eloquent party hack – or perhaps for the person with no childcare responsibilities the next morning. Moreover, internal democracy – like primary elections in the United States – may be <a href="https://shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu/publications/books/responsible-parties">structurally favorable</a> to ideological purists who prefer extreme candidates, or it may elevate people who treat politics <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Politics-Is-for-Power/Eitan-Hersh/9781982116798">like a hobby</a> and prioritize the process over the results. </p>

<p data-line-id="2ffed1ab4a55437e8eea241073b703fd"> NEW YORK – The way people navigate traffic can tell us a lot about their respective cultures. Recently, while walking to my office in midtown Manhattan, I stopped at a red light when an elderly woman with a walking stick caught my attention as she cautiously looked both left and right. When she saw that no car was close enough to hit her – assuming they adhered to New York’s speed-limit laws – she gave me a puzzled look and crossed the street. I must admit, I felt a bit foolish. </p><p data-line-id="6f1e15b0884d4b5a95c4ba1a686b71ab"> Such an incident would be unthinkable in Japan. Years ago, on the first night of a weeklong visit to Tokyo, my young, jet-lagged children, who had lived only in India and the United States, were amazed by the law-abiding Japanese. Peering out of our apartment window at midnight, they observed a man standing alone at a crosswalk. Even with no cars in sight, he waited patiently for the light to turn green. </p><p data-line-id="9e2413eb2d20401b93ebc66dab6a0f3a"> While these normative differences may seem trivial, societal attitudes toward the law can significantly affect a country’s economic performance. Whereas the New Yorker’s actions could be interpreted as aligning with the spirit of the law, the Tokyo pedestrian adhered to its letter. </p>

<p data-line-id="9ddf449013754b87aec2edb8af981bc5"> EDINBURGH – Last Thursday, more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nigeria-mass-kidnapping-children-girls-kaduna-borno-states-isis-boko-haram/">280 Nigerian students</a> were kidnapped from their school in Kuriga, a town in the northern state of Kaduna – the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nigeria-mass-abduction-boko-haram-girls-kidnapped-reports-isis/">second mass abduction</a> of young Nigerians in the span of a week. The international community must urgently act to secure the release of these children, some of whom are as young as eight years old. But equally important is creating safer schools for students throughout Nigeria’s 36 states, so that all children can pursue an education without fear of abduction or violence. </p><p data-line-id="fe891b09fb674e778cbe397435242a1c"> The kidnapping in Kuriga was even larger than Boko Haram’s infamous raid on a girls’ secondary school in Chibok, a town in northeastern Borno State, in 2014. The Islamic militants kidnapped 276 girls; a decade later, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/04/nine-years-after-chibok-girls-abducted/">nearly 100</a> of them are still missing. Armed groups have targeted many schools in the intervening years, although not on the scale seen in the Kuriga attack, which took place only days after militants seized dozens of displaced people, reportedly including many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68490001">young women and girls</a>, in the Borno town of Gamboru Ngala. </p><p data-line-id="231f679307cf40288329880d63377831"> The international community can and must help. First and foremost, the Nigerian government needs surveillance support to locate the abducted pupils. As the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, I am in contact with governments and urging them to help determine the students’ whereabouts, with a view to their quick release. </p>

<p data-line-id="824fb8e1ac484dc3b05f434b9083959e"> ACCRA – It is well known that women in developing economies have fewer educational and employment opportunities than their male counterparts, leading to higher rates of poverty. In Ghana, for example, men have higher employment rates and incomes than women, and are <a href="https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/AHIES%202022%20Q1%20and%20Q2%20Labour%20Force%20Report.pdf">less likely</a> to be engaged in vulnerable jobs. Less widely recognized is that, by some metrics, the gap is not narrowing quickly enough: women in developing economies continue to account for a <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures">significant share</a> of the economically disadvantaged. Add disability to the mix, and the challenges facing women are even greater. </p><p data-line-id="f6e5883284ca42d3a786eb8adf3d0b07"> There are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">over one billion</a> people living with disabilities worldwide, some <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/challenges-facing-people-with-disabilities-in-sub-saharan-africa-in-5-charts#:~:text=About%20one%20billion%20people%20globally,of%20them%20in%20developing%20countries.">80%</a> of whom reside in developing countries. While there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK378951/">many models</a> for measuring disability, some conclusions are indisputable: disability is <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/10/Making-SDGs-count-for-women-with-disabilities.pdf">more prevalent</a> among women (19%) than men (12%); people with disabilities face high barriers to education and employment, leading to higher rates of lifelong poverty; and outcomes for women with disabilities are even worse than those for their male counterparts. </p><p data-line-id="d0959f6ceddc4de6a3735b1c3ce28583"> Ghana’s experience is a case in point. Women are disproportionately represented among the 8% of the population who face <a href="https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/2021%20PHC%20General%20Report%20Vol%203F_Difficulty%20in%20Performing%20Activities_final_161221.pdf">functional limitations</a> related to sight, hearing, mobility, cognition, self-care, and/or communication. And, as the chart shows, 68% of men with disabilities are in <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_631497.pdf">vulnerable employment</a>, compared to 80% of women with disabilities, while 40% of men with disabilities have attained secondary and post-secondary education, compared to just 31% of women with disabilities. </p>

<p data-line-id="937a901ed2ca46699e76c11ee3604b76"> STANFORD – Does free-market capitalism buttress democracy, or does it unleash anti-democratic forces? This question first emerged in the Age of Enlightenment, when capitalism was viewed optimistically and welcomed as a vehicle of liberation from the rigid feudal order. Many envisioned an equal-opportunity society of small producers and consumers, where no one would have undue market power, and where prices would be determined by the “invisible hand.” Under such conditions, democracy and capitalism are two sides of the same coin.  </p><p data-line-id="d1cf9f7545b74221921505f7034e2c67"><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/big-myth-9781635573572/">Domestic</a> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215462/dark-money-by-jane-mayer/">propaganda</a> in the United States has pushed the same optimistic vision over the past century, aiming to convince voters that free-market capitalism is essential to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way">American Way</a>,” and that their liberty depends on supporting unfettered free enterprise and distrusting government. But economic developments in recent decades suggest that we should re-examine such beliefs. </p><p data-line-id="bb72135b4a6e4cbdb9ec84cdaeefd13c"> To see why, allow me first to clarify some background <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/technology-innovation-how-monopolization-and-anticompetitive-market-power-work-by-mordecai-kurz-2023-12?utm_source=Project+Syndicate+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=89908e346e">ideas</a> about what I call <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-market-power-of-technology/9780231206532">technological competition</a> among innovating companies seeking to amass market power. Such competition differs from conventional price competition by producing only one or a few winners, rather than permitting all firms to survive with lower profits. </p>

<p data-line-id="b8e962ff6f5f403d8e193bea1e60cd63">In 2015, world leaders pledged to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” over the subsequent 15 years, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And yet, according to an estimate by the World Economic Forum, it will take another <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2023/">131 years</a> to reach gender parity.</p><p data-line-id="512c319bc4404940bada7fe52456c5c4">As European Investment Bank President <strong>Nadia Calviño</strong>, International Monetary Fund Managing Director <strong>Kristalina Georgieva</strong>, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development President <strong>Odile Renaud-Basso</strong> explain, pursuing gender equality is “not just about social justice or correcting current and past wrongs.” Rather, “inclusion is good for business,” with “greater gender balance on bank boards,” for example “associated with greater <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2017/wp17199.ashx" target="_blank">financial stability</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/15/Women-in-Fintech-As-Leaders-and-Users-520862" target="_blank">better performance</a>.” It is also good for the planet: “a one-percentage-point increase in female managers at a firm” leads to a “0.5% drop in carbon dioxide emissions.”</p><p data-line-id="6033ffe665c240eb98c487062cf353ef">But, as the World Bank’s <strong>Indermit Gill</strong> and <strong>Tea Trumbic</strong> show, recent progress toward gender equality has been significantly overestimated. For example, women now enjoy “just two-thirds of the legal rights that men do – not 77%, as was previously believed.” And even where legislation has been enacted, say, “mandating equal pay for women for work of equal value,” a lack of supportive policies and enforcement mechanisms limits its impact, resulting in a “colossal waste of human capital.”</p><p data-line-id="e9b6168e81b94d93bc27d74979c00b73">We know how to boost women’s economic prospects, points out <strong>Rudo Kayombo</strong> of BRAC International. In Africa, for example, “research and experience have shown the effectiveness of providing women and girls living in extreme poverty with a productive asset, support to meet their basic needs, and long-term coaching and training.” But while countries have “the resources, the evidence, and the technical knowledge,” they often lack “the political will to act.” </p><p data-line-id="620f1e57ee704590bd28aa9ef1804764">But there might be another key reason why economic policies are failing to empower women adequately: the underrepresentation of women in the economics profession. And as former Greek Finance Minister <strong>Yanis Varoufakis</strong> shows, “the field’s dearth of female <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/business/economy/economics-women-gender-bias.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank">role models</a>” is only part of the problem. The bigger issue is that the discipline is centered on <em>Homo economicus</em>: a “male chauvinist rational idiot” in whom “no sensible woman” recognizes herself.</p>

<p data-line-id="126e6b61fac6481ebaebb9b5cfad5a0c"> MELBOURNE – Last month, the European Court of Human Rights decided a case, <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/#%7B%2522itemid%2522:%5B%2522001-230858%2522%5D%7D"><em>The Executive Committee of Muslims of Belgium and Others v.

Muslim and Jewish communities sought to overturn the legislation, claiming that it violated their freedom to slaughter animals in the manner prescribed by their dietary laws. </p><p data-line-id="3a06ad0d40214ec7add31252a85a2b93"> Previous applications to the Belgian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice of the European Union were unsuccessful, so the applicants turned to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), a court of the Council of Europe, to which all European countries, except Belarus and Russia, belong. All members of the Council of Europe must ratify the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>

<p data-line-id="9b8000690918453fbba37bda028721d1"> BOGOTÁ/NAIROBI – Last month, the International Energy Agency’s ministerial gathering took place in Paris, while the African Union, which recently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/african-union-g20-world-leaders/#:~:text=The%20African%20Union%20(AU)%20has,prior%20to%20the%20AU%20joining.">joined the G20</a>, held its annual summit in Addis Ababa. Both fora recognized the urgent need to fulfill the commitments made at last December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, not least to <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">triple</a> installed renewable-energy capacity by 2030. But the challenges ahead are substantial. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f1cc458322c438c8d94ec5a53606471"> COP28 identified many actions that are crucial to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Beyond the sharp increase in renewable-energy capacity, these include <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_6053#:~:text=This%20initiative%2C%20first%20proposed%20by,of%204%25%2C%20by%202030.">doubling</a> the rate of energy-efficiency improvements by 2030, phasing down the “<a href="https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/cop28-ends-call-%E2%80%98transition-away%E2%80%99-fossil-fuels-un-chief-says-phaseout-inevitable">unabated</a>” use of fossil fuels, and providing financial support to developing countries as they work to expand energy access and advance economic development. </p>
<p data-line-id="8dcbb5033f33445483dad250e2167e63"> Africa and Latin America have a central role to play in fulfilling the world’s net-zero ambitions. Both regions boast abundant renewable-energy potential, thanks to vast solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources. By leveraging these, Africa and Latin America can make rapid progress in reducing their carbon emissions, enhancing energy access, and stimulating sustainable economic growth. </p>
<p data-line-id="9211638cf47049aa968c0776c0662f7d"> Our countries, Colombia and Kenya, are already making significant strides toward a cleaner energy mix. Though Colombia has massive oil and gas reserves, hydropower generation accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/lng/010424-colombia-imported-its-highest-annual-lng-volume-ever-in-2023">70%</a> of its electricity production. And the government is committed to increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix further by 2030. By harnessing wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal, Colombia can diversify its renewable-energy portfolio and further reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="d5e0bd405ba348c2845b57b13369e78a"> Colombia is also taking direct action to accelerate the phaseout of fossil fuels. The government recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/colombia-stop-new-oil-gas-exploration-davos">announced</a> a ban on the issuance of new licenses for oil and gas exploration, and has signaled its intention to address the negative effects of fossil-fuel extraction. These measures will not only curb carbon emissions, but also help protect the country’s vulnerable ecosystems and rich biodiversity. </p>
<p data-line-id="5169b166db9345b49b8e51d2b07095da"> As for Kenya, it is emerging as a renewable-energy success story in Africa. Using its vast geothermal, wind, solar, and hydroelectric resources, Kenya has raised the share of renewables in its electricity generation to a whopping <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/country-case-kenya-taps-the-earth-heat">94%</a>. Its geothermal sector has achieved remarkable growth, making it Africa’s leading producer of <a href="https://african.business/2023/11/energy-resources/africa-set-to-overtake-europe-on-geothermal-capacity-says-consultancy#:~:text=Kenya%20has%20led%20the%20way,world's%20seventh%2Dlargest%20geothermal%20producer.">geothermal power</a>. And now, Kenya is helping its neighbors, Ethiopia and Djibouti, to harness their own geothermal resources as well. </p>
<p data-line-id="0b4c2b2415624742bf70eecb9d3c866d"> Underpinning Kenya’s progress are government efforts to implement supportive policies and create an enabling environment for private investment. The Kenyan government’s forward-thinking approach has not only resulted in expanded energy access for its people; it has also created jobs and local industries, thereby advancing economic development and opening up opportunities to collaborate with others. Kenya is a <a href="https://www.irena.org/Events/2024/Jan/Accelerated-Partnership-for-Renewables-in-Africa-Country-Consultations-Zimbabwe#:~:text=Founded%20at%20the%20African%20Climate,to%20accelerate%20energy%20transitions%20in">founding member</a> of Accelerated Partnerships for Renewables in Africa, an initiative that aims to bolster the energy transition in African countries, with support from Denmark, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p data-line-id="5cc1fad5efbd4be895927dfe79b12b11"> Colombia and Kenya’s achievements should be highlighted and celebrated to motivate and guide other countries in their own clean-energy transitions. Those with fossil-fuel resources, for example, must follow Colombia’s example in limiting oil and gas exploration. </p>
<p data-line-id="e542841231c440cf823a2f340c6f088d"> But Colombia and Kenya are not only passive models for others to follow; they are also active global leaders. If their clean-energy transitions didn’t already make their commitments apparent, their recent decision to join the <a href="https://beyondoilandgasalliance.org/who-we-are/">Beyond Oil &amp; Gas Alliance</a> – an international coalition of governments and partners working to facilitate the fossil-fuel phaseout – should make them so. </p>
<p data-line-id="4a465706c95c4772b28353e4a0491216"> Still, financing is key if the world is to realize its clean-energy ambitions. Low investment in Africa is a major challenge. A recent BloombergNEF <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/scaling-up-renewable-energy-in-africa/">report</a> shows that in 2021, just 0.6% ($2.6 billion) of the $434 billion invested in renewable-energy projects went to African countries. A sharp increase in funding flows from rich countries to clean-energy sectors in both Africa and Latin America is urgently needed. </p>
<p data-line-id="6be9c224d46846cd94fe55e6db4d066f"> Beyond direct financial support from rich countries, the global financial system – including the International Monetary Fund and multilateral development banks – must urgently be reformed, so that it is fairer and more efficient. Only then can this system deliver enough financing to meet the growing needs of developing economies. Coordinated action to ease the debt burdens on developing economies is also vital. </p>
<p data-line-id="66098f294a404d6baeb66f2f21db2917"> At COP28, the Global South demonstrated solidarity and a commitment to cooperation. By sharing knowledge and best practices, developing economies can drastically accelerate the clean-energy transition. But, if the world is to succeed at combating climate change and safeguarding our collective future, bold action to ensure adequate financing is essential. </p>

<p data-line-id="54269d7773294561b5dbc34957d64a38"> PRINCETON – The late, sharp-witted economist <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2012/01/17/remembering-michael-mussa">Michael Mussa</a>, my first boss at the International Monetary Fund, once told me that every statistic must pass the “smell test.” I recalled this sage advice recently when Indian authorities published the <a href="https://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Factsheet_HCES_2022-23.pdf">first driblets</a> of a consumption survey in over a decade. The numbers stink. </p><p data-line-id="ead9df8aa436425f9b21352cc2865bcb"> Economists have <a href="https://www.ncaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b1-1.pdf">long maintained</a> that India’s official GDP data overstate growth. Before the September 2023 G20 summit in New Delhi, the Indian National Statistical Office issued a particularly <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-growth-rate-flawed-accounting-ignores-growing-problems-by-ashoka-mody-2023-09?barrier=accesspaylog#:~:text=Indian%20authorities%20are%20downplaying%20inconvenient,a%20cynical%20and%20dangerous%20game.">brazen</a> overestimate. The last decennial census was in <a href="http://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/node/378#:~:text=The%20last%20decennial%20population%20Census,due%20to%20Covid%2D19%20pandemic.">2011</a>. A survey highlighting stubbornly high malnutrition and anemia <a href="https://thewire.in/government/ks-james-iips-director-resignation-nfhs-health-ministry">cost the survey’s director his job</a>. </p><p data-line-id="d109b60cacd34d7daa055b4cd135ecd1"> The last comprehensive consumption-expenditure survey in 2012 showed <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/02/19/a-new-way-to-measure-poverty-in-india/#:~:text=The%20country's%20government%20says%20that,'%20measures%20of%20well%2Dbeing.">22%</a> living in poverty. The government junked a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/extreme-poverty-in-india-eased-in-2021-but-remained-above-2018-level-123101801314_1.html">2018 survey</a> when leaked data indicated an increase in the poverty rate. Not surprisingly, the new <a href="https://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Factsheet_HCES_2022-23.pdf">partial consumption figures</a> generated much excitement. Hastily, Surjit Bhalla, India’s former executive director at the IMF, and economist Karan Bhasin <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/india-eliminates-extreme-poverty/">proclaimed</a> – under the Brookings Institution’s imprimatur – that extreme poverty has been “eliminated.” </p>

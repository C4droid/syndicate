    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--interview english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<div class="question" data-line-id="124f42644f084b0f9354e7b9ad90fffd"><p><strong><em>Sławomir Sierakowski:</em></strong><em> As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, few now believe that Russia can be defeated. What fate do you see in store for Ukraine?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="2fb4d20281974d178479b849003eede1"><strong>Ivan Krastev:</strong> I think your question is too gloomy. The events of the last two years amount to a clear strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin. When he launched his “special operation,” he assumed that Ukraine would fall in three days. </p><p data-line-id="145f901b3a674b838772748b33501850"> Still, Putin did succeed in convincing a majority of Russians that they are in an endless war against the West, one that Russia did not start. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="d4f15ac4f93b4bbfba87dd1d6da872e6"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> Why is this important?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="e201f1d4fb334ea9b43d3e9c39b333e3"><strong>IK:</strong> It means that no one in Russia blames Putin for losing, even though he didn’t achieve what he intended. Together with his success at normalizing the war in terms of Russians’ daily lives – the standard of living is not declining (at least economically) – this allows him to play a long game. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly On Point newsletter" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-onpoint-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="0260bfea749149ef88ab16bf10586001"> Putin believes that time is on his side. Since Western support for Ukraine will weaken, and the Ukrainians will exhaust themselves, Russia does not need to go on the offensive again. This matters, because the loss of even more Russians in another major offensive could start to cause problems for him. So, he waits, destroying Ukrainian infrastructure in the meantime. </p><p data-line-id="da823128f0e948d89ad6e1ffc72a1f4c"> Another point in his favor – confirmed by <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/united-west-divided-from-the-rest-global-public-opinion-one-year-into-russias-war-on-ukraine/">polling data</a> from the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) – is that most people in non-Western countries (except South Korea) believe they are witnessing a proxy war between the United States (and the West) and Russia. That means the Russian war narrative has been accepted in many parts of the world, including in important new middle powers like Brazil, India, and China. Viewed in these terms, Russia is not as isolated as many would like to believe. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="3c39bef61459477cb398da240df4c48b"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> Why have attitudes toward Ukraine’s military prospects shifted so much?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="d4ba88216cc94bc8aedc147f60b95b95"><strong>IK:</strong> Ukraine’s current weakness is due, first of all, to the waning of Western support (both finance and weapons). But Ukraine also has a demographic problem. The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is now estimated to be <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukraines-average-soldier-is-43-how-can-they-keep-putin-at-bay-zf5bqb26m">around 43</a>. That is why Ukraine is now changing its own approach to wage a defensive war. Most likely, the Ukrainians will be able to defend their positions, but they will not achieve anything more. </p>
<p data-line-id="68d751e695c340f89e174183285c6d16"> Another issue is the question of peace negotiations. I doubt Putin will pursue any talks before the US election, though he may signal that Russia is ready to negotiate, in order to weaken Western support for Ukraine even further. The desire among Westerners for the war to end implies that they will not assess such tactics objectively. Sometimes I get the impression that Ukraine’s leaders underestimate the difficulties that both the US and the Europeans face in providing money and weapons. </p><p data-line-id="277f1a5bff8c43ae9736aa514754c659"> In any case, the outcome of the European Parliament elections in June, and of the US election in November, will be crucial to what Ukraine can achieve. But the political situation within Ukraine also matters. Tensions are growing between those on the front lines and those elsewhere. Different groups are blaming different players for the current situation, suggesting that maintaining political unity will be Ukraine’s next major challenge.  </p><div class="question" data-line-id="c0564efcb5af44eeac1f15d6cf8cf58d"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> What is Putin’s general goal? Does he still hope to conquer all of Ukraine, or merely to hold the territories he already has? I am reminded of what former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski </em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/"><em>said</em></a><em>: without Ukraine, there is no Russian empire.</em></p></div><p data-line-id="6f5a39f62a184f2d8b82dbb874ff0f6a"><strong>IK:</strong> The plan reflects the following logic: “What you want depends on what you can achieve.” Russian leaders are probably considering various scenarios right now. If they see an opportunity to capture places like Odesa or Mykolaiv – owing to the apparent weaknesses in Ukraine and among Western countries – they will do so. But as for conquering western Ukraine, I have my doubts, mainly because holding and controlling all that territory would not be easy. </p><p data-line-id="5a60999f3be04c2eb13645cf49ef32b4"> Putin improvises, kind of like a jazz musician. When he sees a weakness, he exploits it. This will be important to remember when it comes to any negotiations. That said, unless Russia is completely defeated, the only peace Putin can agree to is one where Russia keeps the territory it occupies. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="bd2cf8d31dbc4b089c317ee2e3abe5ce"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> How far might he go, opportunistically? Is he still interested in taking Kyiv?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="62b5679455e144a0b4972cb78ea345c1"><strong>IK:</strong> It depends on how he assesses the situation at any given moment. There was a time when taking the Ukrainian capital did not seem unrealistic. And let’s not forget: many critical elements of the Ukrainian economy – from the ports to the main defense industry around Dnipro and Kharkiv – are within 160 kilometers (100 miles) of the battlefield. It is folly to think that the Russians won’t seize these if they see an opening. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="cfadeedaa0a7488eb3e9ae662ca3d1e8"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> Okay, but the most likely scenario is that Putin will either bring about a stalemate or hold the territory he has already captured. The West seems gradually to be accepting this. If the status quo does hold for many more months, or even years, what will that mean for Western countries?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="b7319c67d33c423e91475ff77206af6b"><strong>IK:</strong> The status quo is war. But one could ask what will happen if the West agrees to let Russia control part of Ukrainian territory. Recent ECFR <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/wars-and-elections-how-european-leaders-can-maintain-public-support-for-ukraine/">polling</a> may offer some insights. Interestingly, most Europeans and Americans do not believe their own country is at war with Russia. Instead, the general view is that if Ukraine wins, the victory is ours; but if Ukraine loses, the defeat is its own. </p>

<p data-line-id="9c818329fa534e8dbad6c8d3eb5f1afc"> Overwhelmingly, the same people who believe that Russia will win the war also believe that there will be no European Union 20 years from now. There is a big discrepancy between the real meaning of the war in Ukraine and how it is perceived by the public in many countries. </p><p data-line-id="4bc4fde66c034501b912050911c369fa"> As for Ukraine, it can agree to lose territories only if it has security guarantees, meaning either NATO membership or another bilateral agreement with countries such as the US and the United Kingdom, combined with an assurance of joining the EU. Otherwise, the country will remain completely unstable, both economically and in terms of defense. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="fa460fb5077b4bee8259ab760496c8f3"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>Is there any good news?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="1457ecddbefc46859b3ce12827c3d0e4"><strong>IK: </strong>The good news is that the situation on the front line is changing. The day-to-day picture still isn’t great, but let’s not forget how terrible it looked a week after the invasion, when Russia controlled a much larger area. Ukraine may manage to get enough weapons from its own production facilities and from the West, allowing it to pursue a mobilization that could regain some lost ground (though military leaders won’t want to announce this ahead of time). </p><p data-line-id="95cc42f14d1f4f47a389c52b98af084f"> For now, though, Russia does have the upper hand, and it’s important to be realistic about that. It is easy for Europeans and Americans to pretend that we are not at war because we have a hangover from the miracle of 2022, when cascading Ukrainian victories created the illusion that Russia was a paper tiger that would soon fold. In fact, the Kremlin has successfully orchestrated the shift to a war economy. Commercial interests, not nationalist motives, underpin the mobilization on the Russian side. Russian leaders managed to mobilize the right people with money. Moreover, the quality of the Russian army has improved compared to the first months of the war. </p><p data-line-id="6d9a76870713456f8b0c5694b886fda6"> If it seems that we are too pessimistic now in the West, that is partly because we were too optimistic before.  </p><h2 data-line-id="a7406bcda1ea4f08bc12018e4d6cee37"><strong>The Wobbly West</strong></h2><div class="question" data-line-id="5b3cd2f8702848b890c15fde9c558dee"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>US and European failures to agree on timely arms and aid packages in recent months have underscored some of the West’s own weaknesses. How should we think about that?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="a826646925d44bd8bab4da700256ac43"><strong>IK: </strong>One of the most important things I see is that external threats are no longer sufficient to generate any kind of national unity or mobilization in Western democracies. Poland is a prime example. There is a broad public consensus that Russia’s war in Ukraine poses a threat to Poland, yet Polish politics is still all about the struggle against internal enemies. The same is true in the US. For Donald Trump and his followers, President Joe Biden is a much bigger threat than Putin. As a result, politicians are taking policy positions that are wholly designed to win the next election; they could care less what impact the war will have. </p><p data-line-id="37b6e5b5a4ea4d2c8c2a86bc7e07d968"> In Ukraine, I fear the top leadership is growing more concerned about the supply of basic weapons and ammunition – not just the most advanced technologies. This anxiety will cause more political escalations of the kind we saw recently with the sacking of the commander-in-chief. That is what happens. One escalates when one has no other options. The next few months will be extremely important, because the closer we get to the US election, the fewer options Biden will have. The Republicans have shown that they will not cooperate with him on any issue.  </p><div class="question" data-line-id="1d2c74318d8345b78afd19c30e5c4aff"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>Are you pessimistic about the future of the EU and the US more broadly?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="e2f4480a882b4e83b33a6d3c75a0a844"><strong>IK: </strong>I’m not known for being especially optimistic, but nor do I believe that the course of events is predetermined. Although Russia is quite stabilized internally, it faces serious problems in the long run. The question, then, is whether there will be adequate leadership and enough public concern to understand that we are in a situation that Europe has not faced since the 1940s. There are so many global crises that it is hard to keep people’s attention and interest. It is much easier to focus on internal political games.  </p><p data-line-id="4af42bbcac7e450ca1f6289edf333d6e"> Equally important, social-media platforms have fostered such deep political polarization in many countries that people have radically different perceptions of the same events. Some believe that what happens to Ukraine won’t have any impact on Europe, and others – like the Hungarian and Slovak governments – think the issue should not even concern the EU.   </p><p data-line-id="d7242cb58d0f461681793023cf80b633"> We should not be so critical of Russia, they say. Let it conquer Ukraine, and that way it will be busy with the process of swallowing and digesting another country. But it wouldn’t work out that way, of course. Instead, there would be a crisis in the Baltic states and other neighboring countries (perhaps excluding Scandinavia), and managing EU affairs would become even more difficult. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="447d3fec100848f4a11501177b7ab266"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>Why isn’t the war in Ukraine a wake-up call for all EU countries?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="2997b7f22d304c189e98f07a32c016b8"><strong>IK: </strong>The problem is that you can wake up but still not get out of bed. That is what many in Europe have done. At the ECFR, we just did a <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/a-crisis-of-ones-own-the-politics-of-trauma-in-europes-election-year/">survey</a> showing that Europeans are divided into five separate tribes on the question of Europe’s greatest crisis. In places like Poland and Estonia, the war in Ukraine is seen as the most important; but in Germany, it’s immigration; in Italy, it’s the economy; and in the UK, it’s COVID-19. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="383aa85f661943a49d05307bac7c7334"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>Are Biden’s re-election prospects as bad as they seem, or are there dynamics that we (and the media) are missing?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="5785df1127d347eab74c6ad847be6cfd"><strong>IK: </strong>We have two unpopular candidates. Though both are old men, age seems to be a bigger problem for Biden. Still, consumer sentiment in the US has improved over the past two months, and he can probably count on this trend continuing. The most important thing is who will mobilize more voters. While the Democrats’ potential voter pool is larger, Trump is quite effective in mobilizing the Republican Party base. </p><p data-line-id="092e04b12e964cec9b27cbea04faf00c"> But eight months is a long time in politics, and Biden is dealing with some major problems. Neither the war in Ukraine nor the conflict in the Middle East is helping him. Americans are tired of wars. When I was in the US recently talking to Republican policymakers, I was struck by their isolationism. “What are we doing in Ukraine?,” they asked. “What are we doing in the Middle East?” For many Republicans who support Trump (which is most of them), the only war worth fighting is the one against the reviled “deep state” – which includes not just the Pentagon and the CIA but also Big Tech, Big Pharma, and so forth. </p><p data-line-id="7116fcca0cf648c29f70408fc43d7065"> Equally important is the generational divide that has become so evident during the war in Gaza. The issue here is not that Biden is unaware of his younger constituents in universities; it is that he cannot understand what they are doing, and they cannot understand why he supports Israel. This is a somewhat new, and very important, division in the Democratic Party coalition. </p><p data-line-id="ec16f1b0d0da42e2986ed833d48e0999"> I am reminded of the Russian election in 1996. On one side, you had an aging and increasingly unfit Boris Yeltsin, whose supporters said, “This is a fight for democracy; even if he’s not the best candidate, he’s the only candidate.” On the other side, you had the Communist Party’s Gennady Zyuganov, a candidate who would change everything. And, lest we forget, when Yeltsin won, many wondered the next day, “Who is really in power?” I believe such uncertainty in the US would cost the world a great deal. </p><p data-line-id="e02c8e7c2af846b884f8f501ff1ef305"> In my opinion, Biden has done everything he could to shore up America’s global role. But part of that means understanding the limits of American power. We now have militants in Yemen blocking major trade routes, and it is clear that the US has lost some of the influence it once had over allies like Israel, Hungary, and others. The world, in general, is not in the best place. The level of uncertainty and insecurity means that no electoral victory will lead immediately to stability. </p><h2 data-line-id="6025e41b3df543cd8aa2070369375a51"><strong>Middle Earth</strong></h2><div class="question" data-line-id="8fb2789b8d1d427289c5a7bd7bcdd0a6"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>Do you think political leaders generally cannot achieve as much as they once did? Has the importance of political leadership decreased as the importance of larger social, economic, and technological forces has increased?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="a912ffccfee34368a02f5f1dda58b73f"><strong>IK: </strong>Well, any diminution of leaders’ influence that has occurred certainly is not universal. On one hand, China failed to influence the recent elections in Taiwan, and now it will have to live with the Taiwanese president that it did not want. On the other hand, the political leaders of some so-called middle powers are becoming more important. These include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, and others. Some Ukrainian leaders have told me they trust Erdoğan and see him as the one who can help them vis-à-vis Russia. These leaders are talking to everyone, globally. They suddenly have much more influence than you would have predicted just two or three years ago. </p><p data-line-id="836b0a2a4fe94d1e84dc56b8068873df"> Even in the EU, a single leader can basically block a decision backed by all 26 other member states, completely changing the direction of European policy. In this context, one cannot say that political leadership is losing its importance. Or look at Poland, where we are witnessing the extent to which a change in political leadership can transform the way a country perceives its surroundings. </p><p data-line-id="131898b3e3bb4a33a3fb97a327f7cdb5"> The larger problem for democracies is that every election is starting to look like a regime change, where the outcome will fundamentally change a country’s identity or strategic posture. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="30ecb26263664ff8ac4bcbc8f1bbe2e4"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>We often forget about these middle powers when thinking about the West’s confrontation with Russia or China. How is their new assertiveness affecting international relations?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="79308423cbff406394fa5663dda55a27"><strong>IK: </strong>All these countries are very active on the geopolitical stage. Their leaders are everywhere, and they are becoming important negotiating partners. Look at Azerbaijan. By dint of its own geopolitical maneuvering, it recently managed to achieve what it had been seeking for over three decades: seizing Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia. </p><p data-line-id="17045958ff224910a04f01fc5b4699cd"> This example points to one of the biggest changes of the past two years. Previously, with so many conflicts around the world locked in stalemates, there was a widespread perception that armed force was not really an option. But now, we have begun to see that such “solutions” exist. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="32de0d22408f4b6aa6e344ecd3cb4f81"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>What other countries stand to gain from the rise of middle powers? Will Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore fare well in the current geopolitical environment?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="68c6ca35f0844cbcaf31602dba6d0cfb"><strong>IK: </strong>It’s difficult for them, because – like most Asian countries – they see China’s rise as a threat to their economic and political security. They owe much of their success to the US, and none can contain China on its own. They were happy to see Biden strengthening US alliances, but now they are asking themselves how US policy might change.  </p><p data-line-id="ca1112af6ed649969896255bfd9f6d99"> Interestingly, some of these countries have been quite eager to offer support to Ukraine, not because they are particularly concerned about what is happening in Europe, but because they are keen to test the credibility of American security guarantees and commitments. They have good reason to be nervous, now that the West is failing to sustain its support for Ukraine. </p><p data-line-id="b7a1b2318f7b433b8cd09ea54bf91962"> One also must remember that these countries are politically divided. As many as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-taiwan-election/">60%</a> of Taiwanese voters supported candidates who advocated a much friendlier approach to China than the current president. One must not assume that any of these countries hold strategic positions that cannot change.  </p><div class="question" data-line-id="6643fcba33754061be5cf0815479cc63"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> In other words, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are supporting Ukraine because they want US guarantees to mean more, so that conflicts in their own region are not resolved militarily?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="bdcf6d1483eb4007bee8eb9c61f7d898"><strong>IK: </strong>If America doesn’t get involved, they’re not going to get involved, either – period. They will be very active and supportive if there is a coalition that is vigorously led by the US, but it is unrealistic to think they will continue sending ammunition and funds to Ukraine if the US backs out. It is the same with Taiwan: If the US steps away, the Europeans are not going to step in and take responsibility for the island’s defense. </p><p data-line-id="0734cfc019e248b58c9ae9caebb1407c"> Moreover, many countries simply lack the capacity to mount a strong defense on behalf of others. South Korea was better prepared than most to supply Ukraine, but did you know that North Korea has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/north-korea-outpacing-the-eu-on-shell-supplies/">produced</a> and delivered more conventional artillery shells to Russia than Europe has to Ukraine over the past year? </p><p data-line-id="37ce3c7e351e4d8b9f1a39694ebcdfa9"> Although Europe has the resources, it has been slow to crank up large-scale industrial production in the defense sector. Part of the problem is that each member state is more interested in maintaining its own defense industry than in coordinating to manufacture the most products in the most efficient manner possible. The European Commission says that Europe will have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-to-ukraine-half-is-better-than-nothing-when-it-comes-to-ammunition/#:~:text=While%20the%20bloc%20will%20miss,million%20shells%2C%20EU%20officials%20said.&amp;text=BRUSSELS%20%E2%80%94%20The%20European%20Union%20will,million%20shells%20by%20year's%20end">1.1 million artillery shells</a> for Ukraine by the end of the year. But even if we can produce them, it remains to be seen whether we will deliver them. Many countries will be tempted to hoard them for their own militaries. </p><h2 data-line-id="deae60567dbd486db2e9eb66780f4434"><strong>European Testing Grounds</strong></h2><div class="question" data-line-id="54b9bce6c0e743b7a686b62c55152cc3"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>What are your predictions for the French presidential election in 2027?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="328f26a1a8374a218635a29c4a3e08fb"><strong>IK:</strong> That is a long way off, so I don’t believe anyone can predict much right now. Still, it seems likely that the right-wing leader Marine Le Pen will chalk up a victory in this year’s European Parliament elections. Her party has a ten-point lead over French President Emmanuel Macron’s party, and recent polls predict that in seven EU countries – including Italy and France – the nationalist right will win the largest share. But even if the European far right performs better in these elections than it should, it has a poor track record of fostering cooperation within its ranks, and cooperation is what matters at the European level. </p><p data-line-id="d2d7a14005f645e69ff1b3ab28ae9fdb"> Another interesting finding in the polls is that much of the far right’s current support – outside of Germany and two or three other countries – stems not so much from fear of immigration as from anxiety over the Green Deal (plus lingering anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment). Interestingly, even when far-right governments come to power, immigration often does not decline. A good example is Italy, where only 10% of respondents in our ECFR poll see it as the most important crisis. During the current right-wing government’s past year in power, the number of immigrants <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-meloni-talks-tough-migrants-while-opening-up-foreign-workers-2023-12-06/">increased</a> compared to the previous year. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="d2acbb50f9c64050a7d5bc208d3ccc59"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>The same thing happened in Poland…</em></p></div><p data-line-id="142a0cfb9c744618b461b5853058e37d"><strong>IK: </strong>Yes. I am reminded of the early 1990s, when Polish President Lech Wałęsa would say that “you can make fish soup out of an aquarium, but you can’t make an aquarium out of fish soup.” It is not easy to return from populist rule to the rule of law and normalcy. The last time Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/donald-tusk">Donald Tusk</a> came to power after Jarosław Kaczyński and his Law and Justice (PiS) party, in 2007, it was enough merely to be “normal” instead of “crazy.” But now Poland is so divided that elections and other democratic processes are beginning to resemble a sustained civil war. No one is demobilizing. Losing an election no longer means that you consent to the other side governing. How does one escape this politics in which opponents are not adversaries to be defeated, but rather enemies who must be destroyed? If one side channels Carl Schmitt’s <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo5458073.html">concept of the political</a>, the other must do the same. </p><p data-line-id="49821a03c5084f80a51c3bf018981ea7"> This is the problem facing everyone. The EU stands for the rule of law and impartial institutions, but in a highly polarized political environment, almost no one believes in impartiality anymore. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="4b7cd0b606624e1c849843e2c206dcd3"><p><strong><em>SS: </em></strong><em>How do the recent changes in Poland look from the outside? Do people understand how complicated Tusk’s task is, or do they think he is merely getting revenge on Kaczyński?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="cce11073b84c46c1acf0cf12d798c822"><strong>IK: </strong>Perceptions vary because people always look at foreign countries through the lens of their own country’s experience. What I see in Poland is a firm decision by PiS, now in opposition, not to allow the new government to govern. The president, who remains loyal to PiS, did what he could to delay the formation of the new government, and he has since vetoed whatever he can. The perverse irony is that now PiS is the one invoking the rule of law in its objections to Tusk’s efforts to clean up the state. </p><div class="question" data-line-id="7ff31c5fd8034597b4f66190e713c20c"><p><strong><em>SS:</em></strong><em> Do Western observers understand this?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="45401c299ad14835a27655d1e5cdf250"><strong>IK: </strong>Most are uncomfortable with the situation, especially in the EU institutions. They believe the courts should be apolitical. But that doesn’t really help in a situation like this, where PiS packed the courts with improperly appointed loyalists. Even from the outside, it should be clear that Tusk probably had few if any options other than the ones he has chosen.  </p><p data-line-id="7fea730b228c475a833df42ee42ec037"> Still, one wonders what exactly he can achieve. For example, to unlock the EU funds that were frozen because of the last government’s judicial reforms, Poland must meet certain technically defined requirements. What if the president vetoes the government’s efforts to meet those criteria? Can the EU simply disregard its own criteria? </p><p data-line-id="93d28feca3e04d4d939f347f8aff2e89"> Usually, in a democracy, parties that lose an election regroup while the winning parties govern. But PiS simply acts like it never saw the election results. This attitude probably owes something to the fact that there will be local elections this year, or to the possibility that Trump – whom PiS treats as a great ally – may win in November. PiS is a large party that has managed to consolidate its support base. It is saying, “You may have a majority, but that doesn’t mean we will let you govern.” This attitude may be the new reality in European politics. It’s happening in Poland, and it could happen elsewhere. </p>

<p data-line-id="14c216bd7050487fad0b5c764a3364db"> OXFORD – In a year when some of the world’s largest democracies are holding elections, all too many are riven by deep political divisions. The headline of a 2020 study of “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe1715">political sectarianism</a>” in the United States warns that a “poisonous cocktail of othering, aversion, and moralization” is corroding collective and civic engagement and causing government dysfunction. And the <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2023-01/2023%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report.pdf">2023 Edelman Trust Barometer</a> documents similar trends in severely polarized countries such as Argentina, Colombia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and the US. </p><p data-line-id="c1e3145d13a54dfbbecb64b68fee0ef5"> The US study found that where people once felt fondly toward fellow party members and merely neutral toward those in the opposing camp, they now fear and hate their opponents. Moreover, Americans today are more opposed to dating, marrying, and even living near someone with different political views, and are more likely to discriminate on the basis of politics in the workplace. Similarly in Turkey, almost <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/10/01/how-to-understand-global-spread-of-political-polarization-pub-79893">eight out of ten people</a> would not want their daughter to marry someone who votes for the party they most dislike. Astonishingly, the US study suggests that political orientation has become so important that people will change their self-identified religion, class, and sexual orientation to align with it.  </p><p data-line-id="a9a45bec95234c3eabf52e81bddbd486"> The results of the Edelman survey are especially worrying. A mere 20% of 32,000 respondents in 28 countries said they would be willing to work with or live in the same neighborhood as a person who strongly disagrees with them or their point of view, while only 30% said they would help such a person if they were in need. </p><p data-line-id="43a6e1dd6fb743e29e64766ae24658c4"> Rampant political sectarianism, focused on demonizing supporters of opposing parties, is incompatible with democracy, which requires a modicum of shared identity, interest in collaboration, and person-to-person contact. Otherwise, people will be unable to find common ground with those who vote differently. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="243467f09b384c59a487a4effb4531c8"> In order to reverse this trend, a starting point is to allow people to vote in a more meaningful way. “<a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/electoral-systems-for-divided-societies/">Ranked choice</a>” voting, for example, takes into account people’s backup preferences and incentivizes politicians to reach out to a broader swath of the electorate. By contrast, the system of “primaries” in the US does the opposite, sometimes attracting <a href="https://commongroundcommittee.org/primaries-and-polarization-is-the-system-broken/">less than 20%</a> of registered voters and rewarding more extreme positions. </p><p data-line-id="c3bbde04a0564980932d97c0df39c040"> Increasing <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00253">economic opportunities</a> for those losing ground is vital, such as through social security, tax, and health policies. In too many countries, the number of people who think their families will be better off in five years has fallen to <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2023-01/2023%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report.pdf">record lows</a>. A declining economy can make this worse because people become more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732181/">risk-averse</a>, more focused on their “in-group,” and less willing to work with “out-groups.” But economic growth on its own will not necessarily reduce polarization. In India, for example, the growth of the middle class has led to rising <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/10/01/how-to-understand-global-spread-of-political-polarization-pub-79893">support</a> for exclusionary Hindu nationalist narratives. The key is to expand the number of people who believe that the economic system is fair and not rigged against them. </p><p data-line-id="393020d425174c1090a3c79423bd4240"> Equally important is maintaining shared public spaces, funding for which is often cut in times of austerity. Venues such as public housing, schools, sports clubs, universities, parks, libraries, town squares, and transport give citizens opportunities to interact, break down barriers, and correct false impressions (for example, in the US, Democrats estimate that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe1715">38%</a> of Republicans earn more than $250,000 annually; in reality, only 2% do). As the European Commission has documented, <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/07370fba-110d-11ee-b12e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">political participation</a> is improved by shared, affordable cultural activities. </p><p data-line-id="9dae257f14c149e0b417a678d8d4d197"> Schools are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111596/">particularly vital</a> for socialization and community building. But since the pandemic, absenteeism has increased significantly around the world, from <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/135736/file/Education%20in%20a%20Post-COVID%20World.pdf">refugee camps and the world’s poorest countries</a> to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/10/12/school-absenteeism-absence-pandemic-learning/">US</a> and the United Kingdom. The UK is now trialing “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/jan/14/why-140000-pupils-are-severely-absent-from-school-in-england-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">attendance hubs</a>,” through which schools with excellent attendance rates share ideas with others to reduce truancy. </p><p data-line-id="8b3e8c2f33d84160a3cd6bdd9bfffb1d"> Overcoming the effects of information silos can also decrease polarization. In a recent <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7138">paper</a> in the journal <em>Science</em>, 17 scholars from 12 universities analyzed the data of all Facebook users in the US and found a high level of ideological segregation. People tend to engage only with political-news posts that reinforce their beliefs – conservatives more so than liberals. The study also found that tweaking algorithms to provide users with a more varied diet of political news is not a magic cure, and may even aggravate sectarianism. More promising are interventions that force people to slow down and evaluate what they are reading. Furthermore, many people would likely benefit from spending less time on social media: evidence from the US study of sectarianism indicates that Americans who deactivate their Facebook account become less politically polarized. </p><p data-line-id="27666a5ea07847ee8ca851420754e433"> Lastly, the same study shows that political leadership matters. Politicians who brand their adversaries (and their adversaries’ supporters) as enemies of the people fuel polarization and, in turn, erode the foundation of democratic legitimacy – the consent of the governed. By contrast, people become less divided after observing politicians treat members of the opposing party warmly, while nonpartisan statements from political leaders can reduce violence.  </p><p data-line-id="417dee4002f747adb0f180317065696e"> Fostering a shared sense of humanity, even toward adversaries you seek to beat, is a crucial antidote to the political polarization afflicting so many democracies. An inspiring example comes from the war in Ukraine. In a recent speech at the University of Oxford, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/oleksandra-matviichuk">Oleksandra Matviichuk</a>, whose human-rights organization, the Center for Civil Liberties, was awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, quoted a Ukrainian general on the frontlines. The general was asked, “Do you hate the Russian soldiers in front of you?” “No,” he replied, “I fight because I love those behind me.” </p>

<p data-line-id="cdedfc8e0cd243208b59c60f276a6da1"> CHICAGO – The concentration of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan has raised fears in the United States about the vulnerability of this supply chain should China blockade or invade the island. The US CHIPS and Science Act seeks to address that vulnerability with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/">$52 billion</a> in subsidies to encourage semiconductor manufacturers to relocate to America. But the legislation, as designed, will fall short of its objective; it may even weaken Taiwan’s most important industry, further threatening the island’s security. </p><p data-line-id="7f20eaf46d5b445194a1b802dc3bbcd2"> Today’s semiconductor industry is dominated by specialized companies located around the world. TSMC in Taiwan focuses only on <a href="https://time.com/6102879/semiconductor-chip-shortage-tsmc/">contract manufacturing</a>, primarily of high-end chips, whereas other equally important parts of the semiconductor ecosystem include US companies such as AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm (which only design chips), the lithography specialist ASML in the Netherlands, Japan’s Tokyo Electron (which makes chip-manufacturing equipment), and Britain’s Arm (which produces software used to design chips). </p><p data-line-id="8b97092442ce4dee98f8d07e42716a47"> All this specialization offers two main benefits. First, it means that each part of the global supply chain can focus and improve on what it does best, which benefits other parts of the supply chain. Second, global capacity has increased in all segments of the supply chain, which has made the industry more resilient to demand shocks. </p>

<p data-line-id="b281760fd7354799844ef524954d97db"> CAMBRIDGE – What happens in the United States does not stay in the United States. The global economy depends on America to act as a main engine of growth, and global financial markets depend on US investors’ outsize appetite for risk. This became particularly evident in 2023 when major economies like Japan and the United Kingdom slipped into recession, Germany <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-15/germany-s-economy-shrank-last-year-for-first-time-since-pandemic">narrowly avoided one</a>, and China grappled with obstacles to growth and pockets of high debt. </p><p data-line-id="d3de7fcda5ad454bb13156fa054d261d"> But whether the US economy can drive global growth in 2024 depends on the answers to three key questions. First, can the domestic economy maintain its current growth momentum and achieve the softest of soft landings? Second, can it remain resilient in the face of domestic political divisions and geopolitical uncertainties around the world? And lastly, will investors be able to secure sufficient liquidity to refinance debts accumulated during the era of artificially low interest rates and exceptionally high liquidity injections by central banks? </p><p data-line-id="de5cabaaacab47ab988bf463069d74e7"> Based on current market prices, investors believe the answer to all three questions is a solid yes. Similarly, many economists are optimistic about the US economy, albeit with slightly less enthusiasm than that exhibited by capital markets. </p>

<p data-line-id="f0cf880f75934efdb0c24a33d5052c5f"> WASHINGTON, DC – Last October, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/october/ustr-statement-wto-e-commerce-negotiations">abandoned</a> its longstanding demand for World Trade Organization provisions to protect cross-border data flows, prevent forced data localization, safeguard source codes, and prohibit countries from discriminating against digital products based on nationality. It was a shocking shift: one that jeopardizes the very survival of the open internet, with all the knowledge-sharing, global collaboration, and cross-border commerce that it enables. </p><p data-line-id="f036b8b9e0584703b594e17274d01c4a"> The USTR says that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drops-digital-trade-demands-wto-allow-room-stronger-tech-regulation-2023-10-25/">change was necessary</a> because of a mistaken belief that trade provisions could hinder the ability of US Congress to respond to calls for regulation of Big Tech firms and artificial intelligence. But trade agreements already include exceptions for legitimate public-policy concerns, and Congress itself <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32528">has produced research</a> showing that trade deals cannot impede its policy aspirations. Simply put, the US – as with other countries involved in WTO deals – can regulate its digital sector without abandoning its critical role as a champion of the open internet. </p><p data-line-id="fe54679f36f545869ece3ca4d173a5f5"> The potential consequences of America’s policy shift are as far-reaching as they are dangerous. Fear of damaging trade ties with the US has long deterred other actors from imposing national borders on the internet. Now, those who have heard the siren song of supposed “<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2022/navigating-digital-sovereignty-and-its-impact-on-the-internet/">digital sovereignty</a>” as a means to ensure their laws are obeyed in the digital realm have less reason to resist it. The more digital walls come up, the less the walled-off portions resemble the internet. </p>

<p data-line-id="88c26f83e229432caec69fc38cbd70d0"> CAMBRIDGE – On-campus activities at Senegal’s Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD), one of Africa’s largest institutions of higher education, have been <a href="https://africasacountry.com/2024/02/elections-on-university-off">suspended</a> since last June, when students protested violently against the jailing of the country’s main opposition leader. The prolonged closure has made life difficult for UCAD students, many of whom normally reside on campus, and disrupted operations, because online classes are not widely available. </p><p data-line-id="a889d1512b4340d0b1c86e5a1de90e3a"> The learning gaps that have become visible are exacerbating inequities, fueling social tensions, and threatening the reputation of Senegal’s higher-education system. Calls to reopen UCAD have grown louder, but worsening political conditions – led by the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240222-senegal-s-macky-sall-leaves-date-open-for-delayed-presidential-election">postponement</a> of the presidential election – all but preclude it. </p><p data-line-id="93bab85c08db4fb297c756a448462c6d"> UCAD is far from the only African institution of higher learning in crisis. Recent strikes by students and teacher unions have affected public colleges and universities in <a href="https://theconversation.com/17-strikes-in-23-years-a-unionist-explains-why-nigerias-university-lecturers-wont-back-down-190170">Nigeria</a>, <a href="https://thebftonline.com/2024/01/30/gaua-nationwide-strike-continues/">Ghana</a>, <a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/striking-university-of-pretoria-employees-allegedly-deny-students-access-to-campus-20240219">South Africa</a>, and other countries. These strikes reflect diverse agendas, from political activism to demands for better pay, higher cost-of-living allowances, improved working conditions, and more financial aid for students. </p>

<p data-line-id="668ee7a695d34a7c95ac91b6dcdfe4c4"> SINGAPORE/LONDON – The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) concluded with a <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era#:~:text=UN%20Climate%20Change%20News%2C%2013,cuts%20and%20scaled%2Dup%20finance.">landmark agreement</a> to shift away from fossil fuels and triple the world’s renewable-energy capacity. While this is a step in the right direction, how can we ensure that emerging economies have the necessary resources to achieve a just clean-energy transition?  </p><p data-line-id="6c8d70932a1b43a78aeb305a4e616749"> That question has become a pressing one in Southeast Asia. In 2021, at COP26 in Glasgow, eight of the ten ASEAN countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – unveiled their updated emissions-reduction plans, <a href="https://accept.aseanenergy.org/aseans-emerging-mission-for-a-low-carbon-energy-transition/">setting</a> ambitious decarbonization targets for 2030 and pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a decade sooner than they originally planned. But the past two years have highlighted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/renewable-energy-costs-affordable-enough-asean-the-business-times-ofxxc">massive investments</a> required to build green infrastructure in these developing economies. The International Renewable Energy Agency <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2022/Sep/IRENA_Renewable_energy_outlook_ASEAN_2022.pdf?rev=ef7557c64c3b4750be08f9590601634c">estimates</a> that the bloc’s member states will require an average annual investment of $210 billion up to 2050 to meet their climate goals. </p><p data-line-id="fe7b7bbcf727449188da24458a9921c8"> It is now abundantly clear that no single country or bloc can achieve net-zero emissions on its own, and that a just energy transition will require robust public-private partnerships. According to a <a href="https://www.ifc.org/content/dam/ifc/doc/2023-delta/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-edmes-summary-en.pdf">2023 report</a> by the International Finance Corporation and the International Energy Agency, Southeast Asian countries need $9 billion in concessional financing per year until 2031-35 to mobilize the necessary private capital to decarbonize their economies. </p><p data-line-id="ef99f9e81b4e474f8047ee92ae396072"> Southeast Asia, with its numerous island communities and vast coastal areas, is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. Its carbon dioxide emissions <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/asia-global-transition-net-zero-asian-development-outlook-2023-thematic-report-april-2023">doubled</a> between 1990 and 2020, reflecting rapid economic growth, and energy demand is expected to <a href="https://seads.adb.org/solutions/asean-energy-outlook-calls-accelerated-transition#:~:text=Energy%20demand%20in%20Southeast%20Asia,Centre%20for%20Energy%20(ACE).">triple</a> by 2050, underscoring the need for innovative and cost-effective technological solutions. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="15dded01090d4ce182b36ff8336539a2"> At the same time, the growing frequency of extreme weather events, reduced agricultural yields, deteriorating health conditions, and declining tourism underscore the devastating impact of climate change on Southeast Asian economies. The Asian Development Bank <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/178615/sea-economics-global-climate-stabilization.pdf">projects</a> that global warming could erode the region’s GDP by 11% by the end of the century, while Swiss Re estimates that GDP losses could be <a href="https://www.swissre.com/risk-knowledge/mitigating-climate-risk/economics-of-climate-change-impacts-for-asia.html">as high as 37%.</a></p><p data-line-id="f3a1a203519b4677a35dc63fdf7ebec1"> Recognizing the urgent need for climate action, several Southeast Asian countries have recently announced a series of climate partnerships with international organizations and investors. During COP28, for example, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company, signed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/indonesia-state-power-firm-pln-signs-14-clean-energy-deals-during-cop28-2023-12-15/">14 strategic agreements</a> to accelerate the integration of renewable energy into the country’s power grid, shut down coal-fired power plants, and develop worker training programs. </p><p data-line-id="665bef77fec1402f9abc18c70911d5b8"> Vietnam, acutely aware of its vulnerability to climate change, has taken steps to promote equitable climate solutions. In May 2023, the country approved its new power development plan, <a href="https://greenfdc.org/vietnams-eight-national-power-development-plan-pdp8/">PDP8</a>, which aims to boost wind and gas capacity and reduce reliance on coal. It also joined the <a href="https://poweringpastcoal.org/news/cop28-opens-with-remarkable-international-actions-on-coal-phase-out/">Coal Transition Accelerator</a>, in which Indonesia, Malaysia, and several Western countries share knowledge, develop new policies, and unlock public and private financing to facilitate its shift away from coal. </p><p data-line-id="b4bdd1cfbac943f98321863797868b46"><a></a>While Southeast Asian governments have endorsed numerous clean-energy initiatives on their own, a coordinated approach is the key to ensuring a just energy transition that stimulates economic growth. By fostering cooperation between the public and private sectors, ASEAN countries could gain access to the capital and expertise necessary to mitigate perceived risks and transform capital-intensive projects into viable, investible ventures. </p><p data-line-id="ab773e9d6c464c2aa5ebcbff6557cf48"> But Southeast Asia’s shift to renewable energy requires a concerted global effort as well. By 2050, relatively energy-poor emerging economies are expected to account for <a href="https://energyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GEAPP_P3_PDF_report_120122.pdf">75% of global emissions</a>. To meet the world’s climate targets, the international community must support these countries’ decarbonization efforts. </p><p data-line-id="0f98e2696cd645599900b28c7f494335"> Historically, large corporations and state-owned enterprises have received the lion’s share of climate finance in Southeast Asia. But the clean-energy transition enables ASEAN countries to redirect capital flows toward small and medium-size enterprises, thereby supporting the region’s burgeoning startup ecosystem, creating green jobs, and fostering sustainable prosperity. </p><p data-line-id="86ab15b5fa4e45faae75996a37e8ebc6"> Given that concessional capital is a finite resource, especially when it comes to funding energy-transition projects, it is crucial to establish appropriate financing structures capable of mobilizing early-stage capital. Fortunately, this scarcity offers a unique opportunity to mobilize private-sector participation by leveraging philanthropic capital. Bridging the gap between philanthropy and investment could help promote the development of new technologies and business models that are on the cusp of commercial viability. </p><p data-line-id="822930d117d54ca2bfb7e844fa586f68"> Philanthropic investors with the ability to mobilize private capital have a crucial role to play in advancing Southeast Asia’s energy transition. Through blended finance, they could help demonstrate the viability of emerging technologies, businesses, and projects. To be sure, this approach goes beyond philanthropy’s conventional scope. But by endorsing and structuring transactions that attract development finance, philanthropic funds could catalyze private financial flows. </p><p data-line-id="8168120f01c242c09612ca9ea0e6b540"> The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Fund II (SEACEF II) is a prime <a href="https://energyalliance.org/clime-capital-announces-first-close-of-seacef-ii/">example</a>. In December, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet invested $10 million in SEACEF II, taking a junior equity position and agreeing to cover the first losses. With $127 million in commitments, it is the first blended investment fund dedicated to providing early-stage, high-risk capital to clean-energy startups in Southeast Asia. Its innovative approach highlights the potential role of catalytic, risk-tolerant financing in advancing an inclusive net-zero transition. </p><p data-line-id="58489f1980574c65bef0406371925f83"> Closing the climate-financing gap is crucial to achieving net-zero emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/solving-the-climate-finance-equation-for-developing-countries">McKinsey report</a> estimates that developing countries must invest roughly $2 trillion annually by 2030 to meet their climate targets. By adopting a radically collaborative investment approach, philanthropic funds, governments, financial institutions, and private investors could foster an equitable and economically viable transition to clean energy – in Southeast Asia and around the world. </p>

Around ten million years ago, the ancestors of modern gorillas gave rise, by pure chance, to the genetic lineage for humans.

Gorillas remained at the same biological and technological level as our shared ancestors. Those ancestors inadvertently spawned a physically inferior but intellectually superior species whose evolution implied their own marginalization. </p><p data-line-id="dd050da63a5840c98a5e4c103621f85e"> The connection to AI should be obvious. In developing this technology, humans risk creating a machine that will outsmart them – not by accident, but by design. While there is a race among AI developers to achieve new breakthroughs and claim market share, there is also a race for control between humans and machines. </p>

<p data-line-id="5abecdf988214ede9050bcf73c30fc10">At a recent campaign rally, Donald Trump told his supporters that, during his presidency, he had warned a leader of a “big” NATO country that, if the alliance’s European members did not meet their military-spending obligations, the United States would not defend them from attack. On the contrary, it would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell” it wanted to them.</p><p data-line-id="9ee8b2aa2d344f939496a7e7660a3ff6">For former German vice chancellor <strong>Joschka Fischer</strong>, the message is clear: “the end of NATO and the American security guarantee” may be near, so Europe “no longer has any choice but to become a military and political power in its own right.” To this end, it needs “a common foreign policy, a joint military capability, a European nuclear umbrella, and everything else that forms the basis of meaningful sovereign power in the twenty-first century,” though Europeans remain “unwilling to accept this fact.”</p><p data-line-id="3dc8e45526674d8985c3ca57d68de8a8"><strong>Philippe Legrain</strong> of the London School of Economics’ European Institute agrees: “Instead of merely hoping for a best-case scenario” – that is, the re-election of President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>, who would continue to “support Ukraine and uphold America’s defense commitments” – “Europe must prepare for the worst.” While “European rearmament may seem drastic,” he notes, “the stakes are existential.”</p><p data-line-id="b38a80583cc845d9986a286990b25da3">In European Council on Foreign Relations Director <strong>Mark Leonard</strong>’s view, Trump might be doing Europe a favor. In fact, by forcing Europeans “finally to rethink the core assumptions that have been hamstringing them with regard to the war in Ukraine, Europe’s own defense, and European political unity,” Trump “could end up becoming the European project’s unwitting savior” – but only if Europeans get their act together.</p><p data-line-id="d4a94ee3ee7f45cd8064e55fa7c79ab4">Unfortunately, laments <strong>Daniela Schwarzer</strong> of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, that has not yet happened. At this year’s Munich Security Conference, “European leaders missed yet another opportunity to show how they plan to strengthen NATO’s European pillar and develop a robust European defense industry.” If Europe does not “pull itself together on defense” before this July’s NATO summit, “2024 may be remembered as the year when Ukraine was abandoned, and the transatlantic alliance shattered, with dire consequences for Europe and the world.”</p>

<p data-line-id="4a7032c867474655a5cca125579eadeb"> SEOUL – Few experts doubt that foreign direct investment can bolster economies by bringing in critical know-how, expanding local production, and creating jobs. It is no surprise, therefore, that attracting FDI has long been a top priority for developed and developing economies alike, as reflected in the generous incentives included in the United States’ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. But, when it comes to driving economic growth and development, FDI has a mixed record. </p><p data-line-id="0b9fcc5ab5e74eb69a74be0b76ab68c7"> To understand why, it is worth looking at the contrasting experiences of Penang, Malaysia, and Shenzhen, China. Thanks to its strategic location, low labor costs, and favorable taxes, Penang was among the first Asian cities to attract investment from multinationals, including through its Free Industrial Zone, established in 1972. Later, Shenzhen also began courting FDI, establishing its Special Economic Zone in 1980 – and quickly became a hub of labor-intensive manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="8e5c96e051ac440ea24666a00dbabab0"> But, when it comes to converting that early FDI into income growth and technological upgrading, Shenzhen has been far more successful than Penang. As the chart shows, in 2017, Shenzhen’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162521007058">per capita GDP</a> stood at $39,245 in purchasing-power-parity terms (72% that of the US), compared to just $27,569 (about 50% that of the US) in Penang. Whereas Penang has been slow in growing out of low-value-added manufacturing, Shenzhen has cultivated a thriving high-tech sector. The <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040162521007058">number of US patents</a> registered to inventors with an address in Shenzhen increased from zero in the 1990s to about 2,500 in 2017, whereas Penang had reached just 100. </p>

<p data-line-id="6a30a942c1504530a439d612fc9e7a53"> CAMBRIDGE – The United States is in unusually good economic shape nowadays – no recession in sight. But it seems to be enduring a “vibecession”: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">public-opinion surveys</a> show broad dissatisfaction with the economy and US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s stewardship. What explains this disconnect between performance and perception? At least six answers – some far more credible than others – have been advanced. </p><p data-line-id="31e7be46ceb24c248e8a06467b14cb4f"> The first is that there is <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1665007599224516609?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">no disconnect</a> at all; the positive economic indicators are wrong or misleading, and the true state of the US economy is as poor as public opinion indicates. This explanation is simply wrong. While any given number can be subject to measurement error, a wide variety of statistics – covering <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product#:~:text=Real%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP,in%20consumer%20spending%20and%20exports.">economic growth</a>, labor-market strength (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">jobs created</a> or <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">unemployment</a>), and inflation (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi">consumer price index</a> or <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change">personal consumption expenditures</a>, either headline or <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-inflation-rate">core</a>) – have been collected, largely separately. And they overwhelmingly paint a very positive picture. </p><p data-line-id="024cc115ee6845bc895220c25e81cce0"> The second possible <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1756304442276602225">explanation</a> – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/opinion/economy-survey-republicans.html">offered</a> by economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-krugman">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href="https://www.briefingbook.info/p/asymmetric-amplification-and-the">others</a> – is that the negative <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=75026">survey results</a> reflect Republican partisanship. Though one might assume that Democrats and Republicans are equally partisan, Republican poll respondents actually tend to be much more heavily influenced by which party controls the White House. When Republican Donald Trump succeeded Democrat Barack Obama, Republicans were suddenly reporting far higher satisfaction with the economy. When Democrat Biden took over, they again became fixated on the supposed economic deprivation of American households. Poll responses by Democrats tend to follow economic indicators more closely. </p>

<p data-line-id="87ebb1277f2f4d8a90a6d1cb6a354608"> CAMBRIDGE – One of the defining economic challenges of our time is how to distribute the value generated by groundbreaking technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence and recent innovations in biomedicine and manufacturing, which rely on massive computing power. To improve living standards, the benefits of transformative technologies must be widely shared. So far, however, these benefits have been monopolized by a small cadre of tech billionaires. </p><p data-line-id="6b0a263c24e146fc86842de04bcac017"> Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a prime example. Most people recognize that Musk did not deserve the $56 billion in annual compensation that the company’s board of directors attempted to give him in 2018, given Tesla’s relatively modest profits and years of losses. Nevertheless, the board <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/case-against-elon-musks-56-billion-pay-package-2024-01-30/">argued</a> that this enormous sum was necessary to incentivize Musk to remain at the company – an argument so baseless that a Delaware judge recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-rules-favor-plaintiffs-challenging-musks-tesla-pay-package-2024-01-30/">invalidated</a> the board’s “unfathomable” compensation package. </p><p data-line-id="db1b045676694c61bcc65660c6eb953f"> But Musk is hardly alone. Other tech behemoths, such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/22/alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichais-compensation-topped-200-million-in-2022.html">Alphabet</a> (Google’s parent company), have similarly lavished their CEOs with hefty salaries and stock options under the guise of retaining top talent. In reality, however, the actual contribution of star executives is often unclear. Notably, a <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/1991%20JLEO%20Holmstrom%20Milgrom.pdf">classic 1991 study</a> by Nobel laureate economists Bengt Holmström and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-milgrom-1">Paul Milgrom</a> suggests that incentive pay works only with simple tasks that have measurable outcomes and are executed by a single worker; in such cases, compensation can be directly linked to individual performance. </p>

<p data-line-id="f99cfd7144dc4ed484ac4586170c2822"> NEW YORK – Every country is eager to attract foreign direct investment – and for good reason. FDI facilitates capital inflows, creates jobs, drives skills development, and facilitates technology transfers, accelerating economic growth and enabling recipient countries to access global markets. </p><p data-line-id="fe025a8b01a548b491d6af8a5d074fa4"> But global competition for FDI is fierce. To attract it, governments around the world have liberalized their foreign-investment policies, established investment-promotion agencies, and provided multinational firms with numerous incentives. Now, the World Trade Organization is on the verge of introducing a new mechanism to facilitate FDI flows: the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/archive_e/infac_arc_e.htm">Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement</a> (IFDA). </p><p data-line-id="4e21fd18dcd741b0b3c13304d2980119"> The concept of an investment-facilitation mechanism was <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3842713">first proposed in 2015</a>. After years of preparations, WTO members began negotiations in September 2020, with developing countries taking the lead. More than 120 member countries endorsed the IFDA’s text in November 2023 – an accelerated timeline underscoring developing countries’ urgent need to attract FDI to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>

<p data-line-id="c070689308c04b3986d889cd43c2337e"> KYIV – February 24, 2022, when Russia marched hundreds of thousands of troops into Ukraine, marked the beginning of a major geopolitical earthquake. For two years, Europe has been living with the grim reality of the continent’s largest war of aggression since World War II, and with widespread, horrifying atrocities. </p><p data-line-id="5b90a41b6b91478c93b38416725ed8b6"> What Russia is doing is a classic example of nineteenth-century-style imperial and colonial aggression. Ukraine is enduring what many other countries have cruelly suffered in the past. For Russia, this war has never been about Ukraine’s neutrality, NATO enlargement, protecting Russian-speakers, or any other fabricated pretexts.  </p><p data-line-id="8e49e336cdaa404eb54d51ae2f052bc4"> Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine does not exist as a nation and that Ukrainian identity is artificial. The war is solely about annihilating an independent country, conquering land, and re-establishing dominance over a people that decided to be masters of their own destiny. Russia’s imperial ambition is doubtless familiar to many nations around the world that were previously subject to colonial rule and oppression. </p>

<p data-line-id="d9588768d3184b08a067b6b40a3bb6a2"> CAMBRIDGE – As the crypto winter thaws, and financial institutions renew their interest in digital assets, an old debate has re-emerged over whether blockchain is truly a “trust machine,” as <em>The Economist </em><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/31/the-trust-machine">described</a> it in 2015. </p><p data-line-id="45429e5136fb439ca0670f2d39b78d36"> A figure from fifteenth-century Venice can help answer that question. Though he was neither a technologist nor a banker, the friar Luca Pacioli is remembered today for developing the <a href="https://www.stptax.com/luca-pacioli-the-father-of-accounting/">double-entry bookkeeping accounting system</a> that underpins much of the modern economy. It was his ingenious model that introduced debits and credits to the method of recording transactions in two separate accounts. </p><p data-line-id="ec978a52aa54454c9e0f57197e1e2cf6"> This seemingly boring and cumbersome tweak to a core business function didn’t just ensure accuracy and curb fraud; it also gave owners new insights into how to run and improve their businesses and cut costs. Under Pacioli’s system, efficiencies soared, commerce accelerated, and the Renaissance took flight. Double-entry accounting became a <a href="https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/2019/4/26/how-double-entry-bookkeeping-changed-the-world">cornerstone</a> of economic activity because it was simple, easily shared, and undeniably useful. Centuries later, financial statements based on Pacioli’s work became mandatory for any business. Such is the power of a basic infrastructure upgrade. </p>

<p data-line-id="d03ca4e4072b4b22b544c86ba37ea338"> STOCKHOLM – We may never know exactly how and why <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/alexei-navalny">Alexei Navalny</a> died in the remote Arctic penal colony where he was detained. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-prison-service-statement-about-navalnys-death-2024-02-16/">communiqué</a> that Russian officials issued within two minutes of the popular opposition leader’s reported time of death will never be believed, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/20/navalny-mother-body-putin-plea/">delay</a> in releasing his body to his mother only adds to the suspicion. </p><p data-line-id="747f4d4bf482402997c338d23c492862"> Still, we can say for certain that were it not for the Kremlin, Navalny would be alive today. After <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/novichok-attack-putins-fingerprints-by-alexei-navalny-and-tikhon-dzyadko-2020-10">trying to kill</a> him with a sophisticated nerve agent a few years ago, President Vladimir Putin’s regime had been moving him to increasingly brutal prisons. With Russia holding a presidential “election” this year, it seems that Navalny was deemed too dangerous to keep alive. </p><p data-line-id="42d6d9a795554741a7fa67b89bdf8029"> I first met Navalny in early 2011, when I was invited to address a conference in Moscow honoring the memory of Andrei Sakharov, the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who went on to become an exponent of the liberal opposition in the late-Soviet era. In fact, Navalny was one of the main reasons why I made the trip. He had started to make a name for himself, and we arranged a breakfast that turned into a long conversation. </p>

<p data-line-id="21c1fd957cd8492188eb0156ba702954"> BERLIN – Europe’s situation in 2024 is difficult, even dangerous. In Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression – an effort to wipe the country off the map and annex its territory – is entering its third year. In the United States, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for November’s presidential election, is making wild threats against America’s longstanding allies, even encouraging Putin to attack European countries that do not spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. </p><p data-line-id="c588a8625f06402c908e104aa1a1df4f"> If Trump wins in November, it would probably be the end of NATO and the American security guarantee. Europe would be completely on its own, trapped between an imperial Russian neighbor and an isolationist America on the other side of the Atlantic. Making matters worse, Europeans continue to cling desperately to an inherited grouping of “sovereign” nation-states, even though most are sovereign only on paper, because they are too weak to face current geopolitical realities on their own. </p><p data-line-id="373bc94f4197494a9b7b1938020f8d9a"> The situation demands greater European unity: namely, a common foreign policy, a joint military capability, a European nuclear umbrella, and everything else that forms the basis of meaningful sovereign power in the twenty-first century. Europeans, however, remain unwilling to accept this fact. </p>

<p data-line-id="e99f3e45adc74e22ac69f69d305649af"> ITHACA, NEW YORK – In 1930, John Maynard Keynes published his short essay “<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_and_Section_I.pdf">Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren</a>,” in which he outlined his vision of a future global economy characterized by leisure and abundance. As the rapid advance of artificial intelligence threatens to displace millions of workers, it is worth revisiting this brilliant, passionate work. </p><p data-line-id="203ddbf83d024b3ab812ab131cc5a546"> Keynes originally wrote his essay in 1928 for a lecture at a boys’ school in Hampshire, England, and spent two years revising it before its publication. Despite being taken aback by the 1929 stock market crash, he encouraged his readers to view it as a “temporary phase of maladjustment.” Demonstrating his characteristic foresight, Keynes avoided making predictions for the next five or ten years, instead focusing on the century to come. </p><p data-line-id="ddfe81a2660345dfa8d3425436cb755b"> Many of Keynes’s insights were remarkably prescient. Modern society, he observed, had become “afflicted with a new disease,” whereby technological advances had reduced demand for labor. But he viewed this “technological unemployment” as a reason for hope, not despair, predicting that innovation would drive rapid GDP growth and usher in an age of leisure. “The standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence,” he speculated, “will be between four and eight times as high as it is.” Despite the economic ups and downs of the past century, this prediction has proven to be accurate. </p>

<p data-line-id="30903ff23bdd4f4f9656bad06abf6c27"> EDINBURGH – The COVID-19 pandemic taught us several lessons, many of which came at great cost. Chief among them was that, despite years of rehearsals, the world was not prepared for a fast-moving outbreak of a novel infectious disease. </p><p data-line-id="4eba156a9af441cbbac8acb0fb481093"> Countries failed their own citizens, but the global response was even more inadequate. It was marked by an inexcusable absence of cooperation and coordination, ugly nationalism that included vaccine hoarding, and greed on the part of Western countries, which refused to share information, pathogens, and therapeutics. I would say that the response was – to use a word that may seem old-fashioned and out of favor in some quarters – sinful. </p><p data-line-id="8e873ccc56fc48fc88af2fb7fa4faf53"> The overwhelming lesson we learned the hard way is that no one is safe anywhere until everyone is safe everywhere. Could the wave of infections caused by the second Omicron variant have been avoided if the Global South had been vaccinated more quickly? We cannot be sure. But we do know that international cooperation is not compatible with nationalism, xenophobia, and new forms of colonialism. We need a form of globalization that works for everyone, because while our world may be deeply fractured, we are all still inescapably interdependent. </p>

<p data-line-id="31e1e6b236cb4c618c1b4de3fb1dc907"> MUNICH – “Words, words, just words,” sighed one VIP attendee at the <a href="https://securityconference.org/en/">Munich Security Conference</a> as representatives of three European Union member states discussed security cooperation. “China will get the message: ‘No need to worry about us here,’” said another about the signals being sent from Bavaria. </p><p data-line-id="afaf48916ac7498c829e46234ddaef4c"> A lugubrious mood hung over the entire gathering of policymakers and security experts this past weekend. Leaders seem overwhelmed by the confluence of crises and deepening global challenges; many simply appeared exhausted. The news about Ukraine <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68322527">losing</a> the city of Avdiivka certainly did not help. Ukraine’s ammunition supplies are running low, and no one knows if US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> will be able to get another aid package through Congress before the end of his current term. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/alexei-navalny-killed-in-prison-after-yet-more-stalin-style-show-trials-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2024-02?a_la=english&amp;a_d=65d0acb3e647a59866450789&amp;a_m=&amp;a_a=click&amp;a_s=&amp;a_p=homepage&amp;a_li=alexei-navalny-killed-in-prison-after-yet-more-stalin-style-show-trials-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2024-02&amp;a_pa=curated&amp;a_ps=main-article-a2&amp;a_ms=&amp;a_r=">death</a> of the imprisoned Russian opposition leader <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/alexei-navalny">Alexei Navalny</a> further underscored the brutality of Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship in Russia. </p><p data-line-id="4dcb40551fc947078fec688468c1fd0f"> But the biggest chill came from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/17/trump-comments-nato-conference">looming prospect</a> of a second Donald Trump presidency, which would weaken NATO and increase tensions with China. The timing could not be worse: Russia may be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/russia-nuclear-weapon-space.html">trying to send</a> nuclear weapons into space, and China’s <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-defense-budget-increase-29-straight-year-1869731">defense budget</a> has reached record highs. On the conference stage, the dialogue was mostly about reassuring European allies (as it is every year). In the corridors, however, US participants warned their friends that they should start preparing to take care of themselves. </p>

<p data-line-id="f15dc93b943d4f0db7179b41a3726a1f"> WASHINGTON, DC – Nearly everyone agrees that the unequal distribution of income, wealth, and opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has hindered efforts to build cohesive societies and robust democracies, as well as frustrating the ambitions of young people. But efforts to close the gap between rich and poor have fallen short, and progress has stalled. Governments urgently need better evidence on how to remedy this longstanding problem. </p><p data-line-id="9848067b30f6468b9b963a32397afd23"> To this end, the Inter-American Development Bank has teamed up with the London School of Economics, Yale University, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and academics from more than a dozen leading universities to launch a <a href="https://lacir.lse.ac.uk/en-gb/about">comprehensive reconsideration</a> of inequality in LAC. The project’s initial research – including critical reviews of the existing literature, fresh data, and new analyses – has already shown that inequality in the region is neither as predictable nor as static as many believe. </p><p data-line-id="6017656b283c4e9f863455ce77f03e53"> For starters, LAC is not uniformly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/980285/income-distribution-gini-coefficient-latin-america-caribbean-country/">unequal</a>. Some countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama, have extremely high income inequality, whereas others, including Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Uruguay, have income disparities similar to that of the United States. </p>

<p data-line-id="a9c34872c8414d6d9975f933fabd2d46"> GABORONE – As sea levels rise, Tuvalu, a small archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, is slowly disappearing under water. Australia recently signed a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231110-australia-offers-tuvalu-citizens-climate-refuge">landmark agreement</a> with the island state that offers residency to Tuvaluans displaced by climate change – a sign of the emerging economic, geopolitical, and humanitarian implications of global warming. Tuvalu’s reckoning with its potential extinction offers a glimpse of what the future holds on a rapidly warming planet. </p><p data-line-id="dc355ef880994dda8861e2c47e754db6"> And yet many policymakers seem oblivious to the transboundary nature of the climate crisis and its imminent impact on all countries. Research <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health">shows</a> that 3.6 billion people – nearly half of the global population – now live in areas that are highly susceptible to climate change. People in the world’s poorest countries – in particular, women, girls, and indigenous communities – are especially vulnerable to its effects, despite contributing the least to creating the problem. </p><p data-line-id="a9d654f6903143f68e22ce8fd30f955b"> These populations often rely on the natural environment for their survival, which means that extreme weather events are more likely to destroy their lives and livelihoods. Over the last decade alone, natural disasters in the poorest countries have resulted in a <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/12/02/for-the-poorest-countries-climate-action-is-development-in-action">threefold increase</a> in economic damage compared to three decades ago and the reversal of hard-won development gains. </p><p data-line-id="1875240afd1d43ed8f5a7fcc27578939"> Developing countries cannot be left alone to face the frightening consequences of global warming. The severity of the current and future effects of climate change will depend on the world’s ability to advance collective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience-building goals in a gender-sensitive and inclusive manner. These efforts must put human welfare and our planet’s health front and center, which implies capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge that indigenous communities have amassed. Equally important, they will require adopting innovative, efficient, transparent, and equitable financing solutions. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9923fc22abb04a03ab035eb1f89a5825"> The agreement at last year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) to operationalize the <a href="https://turkiye.un.org/en/254449-cop28-talks-open-dubai-breakthrough-deal-loss-and-damage-fund">loss and damage fund</a>, which will provide financial assistance to climate-vulnerable countries, is a step in the right direction. However, the initial pledges of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/700m-pledged-to-loss-and-damage-fund-cop28-covers-less-than-02-percent-needed">$700 million</a> fall short of the <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_L17_adv.pdf">$215-387 billion</a> that developing countries will need annually up to 2030 to meet their adaptation needs. As the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary, Simon Stiell, <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/let-us-give-adaptation-the-money-and-attention-it-deserves-simon-stiell-at-cop28-event-on-adaptation">stated</a>, the loss and damage fund “is in no way a replacement for, or a reason to diminish, the urgent need for the scaling-up of adaptation finance.” </p><p data-line-id="fcebe3d5b1bd463f8a4ae80822194708"> Moreover, around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/cop28-deal-just-about-keeps-net-zero-road-2023-12-13/">$4.3 trillion</a> per year must be invested in clean energy until 2030 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This further highlights the urgent need to establish a comprehensive adaptation framework with monetary, qualitative, and quantitative targets that can be used to secure financing from high-income countries.  </p><p data-line-id="2ca79a9214584117b09efc098b874718"> The incremental progress on climate finance achieved at COP28 is not ambitious enough. To pursue climate action that meets the needs of vulnerable and indigenous communities will require a mission-oriented approach to financing that focuses on achieving the most efficient and just transition. It will also be necessary to scale up investment in mitigation and adaptation efforts dramatically. At COP28, for example, governments agreed to <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/global-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-pledge">triple</a> renewable-energy production capacity and transition away from fossil fuels. To succeed, they will need to make bold, concrete commitments to boost transition finance. </p><p data-line-id="ee9051d3a4a74d1a900cd2ee8a1e6818"> Africa provides abundant evidence that climate finance continues to be unjust and insufficient. The continent is disproportionately affected by climate change (even though it contributes the least to greenhouse-gas emissions). Between 2016 and 2019, however, it received only <a href="https://www.uneca.org/stories/developed-countries-asked-to-finance-climate-change-in-africa">3%</a> of global climate-finance flows, despite various initiatives aimed at supporting climate adaptation and mitigation on the continent. </p><p data-line-id="90d4c31e14c1454fbc0b2a8749664c04"> Africa can play a leadership role in defining and championing progress and could even become a model for innovative, efficient, and equitable climate-finance deployment. African institutions, including the African Export-Import Bank, the African Development Bank, and the African Risk Capacity Group, are reputable partners with experience in financing and in navigating the political and economic environment on the continent. But we must urgently close the gap; climate shocks are exacerbating tensions in fragile areas such as the Sahel, fueling mass migration and security concerns worldwide, and disrupting global supply chains and trade. </p><p data-line-id="ea0e77ff92c7418ea1a68cd2d3b9210d"> Africa has the ideas, ambition, and capacity to implement climate solutions. For example, we have identified dozens of shovel-ready green projects that only need a financial push to get off the ground. The continent is also home to some remarkable women who are leading the fight against global warming. I have collaborated with some of these climate champions, whose dedication and expertise are second to none. </p><p data-line-id="a05966cb44674a539ed5385fe2542057"> The Global South has immense potential to achieve a just transition and build climate resilience. All that is missing is the funding. Governments of high-income countries, multilateral institutions, the private sector, and international organizations should provide the necessary investment, while also ensuring that women have a say in the development of climate-finance strategies. But first, they must stop seeing investing in our countries as a risk – and understand that the real risk lies in the failure to act swiftly enough. It is time to rebuild trust and reconceive development cooperation through just, equitable, and financed frameworks. </p>

Until we confront this limiting idea, AI governance is likely to go the way of the “environmental, social, and governance” movement, at best being paid lip service, and at worst, being actively ignored.

This is not merely out of sympathy for my American friends, who see him as a danger to the future of their republic, but also because I fear what he would do to the global order. As a European, though, I am somewhat grateful for Trump’s existence. Even if he loses the election this November, he could end up becoming the European project’s unwitting savior. He has forced Europeans finally to rethink the core assumptions that have been hamstringing them with regard to the war in Ukraine, Europe’s own defense, and European political unity. </p><p data-line-id="dc572789d4244b82a72e8b95fe37945c"> As the war in Ukraine nears the end of its second year with no end in sight, Trump’s candidacy is focusing European minds about what victory and defeat might entail. Everyone’s ideal outcome is for Ukraine to recover all its territory. Watching the Russian opposition leader <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/alexei-navalny">Alexei Navalny</a>’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/yulia-navalnaya-munich-security-conference-navalny-putin">take the stage</a> in Munich hours after learning of her husband’s death, it was impossible not to recoil at the thought of giving Vladimir Putin even one square inch of Ukraine. But as the war of attrition grinds on, it makes less and less sense to consider the matter only in territorial terms. </p>

<p data-line-id="53bc96192917429fbf448f4ee269987f"> ANGERS – Trade negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) began in 1999 and, illustrating the challenges inherent in forging trade pacts among blocs with diverging national interests, resulted in a <a href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/mercosur_en">provisional agreement</a> only in 2019. Since then, efforts to finalize the agreement have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f55c8ec8-f9e2-496b-a3df-db05cc4638cd">floundered</a>. European leaders must recommit to reaching a deal, which will require deft diplomacy. </p><p data-line-id="118f07d6e7e04ff588e30bed246976b1"> An EU-Mercosur trade agreement would undoubtedly yield economic gains for both sides. But it also has <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-mercosur-must-complete-trade-agreement-negotiations-by-josep-borrell-2022-11">strategic significance</a>, especially for the EU. At a time when the bloc is wary of depending on China, a trade deal with the world’s <a href="https://www.mercosur.int/en/">fifth-largest economy</a> would allow EU member countries to forge new economic ties, secure the critical resources needed for the green-energy transition, and counter Chinese influence in the region. Moreover, as climate change exacerbates food insecurity, a deal would enable the bloc to diversify its suppliers. </p><p data-line-id="cdbf208d106c4a5295643dfae374731c"> But too many policymakers fail to grasp the benefits of strengthening EU-Mercosur ties. Despite the opportunity presented by Brazil’s Mercosur presidency and Spain’s EU presidency in 2023, an agreement was not reached. But with Brazil’s G20 presidency in 2024, and with Mercosur countries playing an active role in that group, this year could be a watershed for the EU-Mercosur relationship. </p>

The party has been gradually <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-labours-28bn-green-prosperity-plan-13066640">scaling back</a> its Green Prosperity Plan, first unveiled by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves in September 2021, since June 2023.  </p><p data-line-id="03db0e0d4cff4d74b535da1054184e42"> Instead of spending an additional £28 billion annually on green investments for five years, as initially proposed, the party now plans to spend just <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/02/09/uks-labour-party-slashes-green-spending-pledge-in-major-u-turn-00140678">£23.7 billion</a> – less than £5 billion per year. Moreover, while the original plan relied solely on government borrowing, the updated version aims to raise £10.8 billion through windfall taxes on major oil and gas companies. </p>

<p data-line-id="06664574848b413089fc8c47a9f51cbd"> WASHINGTON, DC – Following Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine 24 months ago, Western governments – including the United States – froze around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-where-are-russias-300-billion-reserves-frozen-west-2023-12-28/">$300 billion</a> of Russian central-bank assets, or roughly half of the country’s total foreign currency and gold reserves at the time. The aim was to prevent the Kremlin from using those funds as part of its war chest or to blunt the impact of US and European economic sanctions. </p><p data-line-id="0ec0b38096ba459197cdc546d62090aa"> The freeze on Russian assets was an aggressive component of the Western response. But some officials and commentators want to go further, by seizing the assets and using them for Ukraine’s reconstruction. This month, Nikki Haley, who is challenging Donald Trump in the Republican primary contest, announced her support for such a move. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is a war criminal and thug who invaded a free country,” she <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-14/haley-backs-bill-to-seize-russian-assets-as-trump-threatens-nato?sref=1pnqJ0TR">told</a> Bloomberg News. He therefore must “pay the price for his actions.” </p><p data-line-id="2b1d566e574a4dedba295c26270d3e92"> To that end, Haley is supporting the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act, an unprecedented piece of legislation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-senate-panel-steps-toward-seizing-russian-assets-help-ukraine-2024-01-24/">approved</a> by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month by a 20-to-one vote. If REPO becomes law, it would be the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4426738-seize-russian-assets-ukraine-senate/">first time</a> the US has seized the central-bank assets of a country with which it is not at war. </p>

<p data-line-id="e30b5f92545e41b2909be6b723f10214"> WASHINGTON, DC – The past 12 years have been extremely good for the ultra-rich. The fortunes of billionaires – a group comprising the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">2,640 wealthiest people</a> on the planet, most of whom are men – has more than doubled. The wealth gap between the top 0.01% and the bottom half of the world’s population has <a href="https://wid.world/news-article/whats-new-about-wealth-inequality-in-the-world/">increased by 50%</a> since the 2008 global financial crisis. </p><p data-line-id="4ddbaf4602b24a23a65b68e1f532081a"> The aftermath of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine have been particularly lucrative for the ultra-wealthy as they reaped an enormous windfall from pandemic-era <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/747a76dd-f018-4d0d-a9f3-4069bf2f5a93">stimulus packages and corporate welfare</a>, raked in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/06/worlds-722-biggest-companies-making-1tn-in-windfall-profits">record profits</a> by raising prices and blaming inflation, and benefited from decades of <a href="https://thehill.com/lobbying/3961472-lobbying-firms-start-strong-after-record-4-billion-haul-in-2022/">favorable policies</a>. A <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/inequality-inc/">recent report by Oxfam</a> found that the combined wealth of the world’s five richest people – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, Larry Ellison, and Warren Buffett – has more than doubled since 2020, to $869 billion. </p><p data-line-id="5d67706e6bdb4ad2a8825bcbfdd56ca6"> At the same time, nearly five billion people, representing 60% of the world’s population, have become poorer. While <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/great-convergence-equality-branko-milanovic">global income inequality</a> declined gradually over time, primarily due to rising incomes in China, inequality <em>between</em> countries has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/isp/overview">increased</a> for the first time in decades, and <a href="https://wir2022.wid.world/www-site/uploads/2023/03/D_FINAL_WIL_RIM_RAPPORT_2303.pdf">inequality <em>within</em> most countries</a> has increased, too. Worryingly, a <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/12/18/2023-in-nine-charts-a-growing-inequality?cid=ECR_TT_worldbank_EN_EXT">recent World Bank analysis</a> has found that “the fight against poverty has stalled.” Given the current trajectory of wealth distribution, the world could have its first trillionaire within a decade, while eradicating global poverty would take 230 years. </p>

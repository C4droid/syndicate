    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="f0fff77e009f4d75938c50ca1d7406e4"> LONDON – Central banks have drastically changed the way they implement monetary policy. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have been providing liquidity directly to banks and other financial institutions – an activity that used to be the preserve of money markets – and massively expanding their balance sheets. Is it time to reverse these changes, reviving interbank money markets and shrinking central-bank balance sheets, or is this the new normal? </p>
<p data-line-id="6f6b69e44c8d4d55ba46f7b4737dfe7a"> To be sure, central-bank balance sheets are already set to get somewhat smaller. The <a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/federal-reserve-tapering-asset-purchases.html">Fed</a> and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/267599/Final_CLAEYS.pdf">ECB</a> have made clear that they intend to roll back quantitative easing by gradually reducing their bond holdings. But the other cause of central banks’ balance-sheet expansion – the provision of abundant reserves to the financial sector – remains up for debate. Though the Fed has formally adopted this approach as its new operational framework, the ECB has launched a review of the policy. </p>
<p data-line-id="a2dbc2a6c050484c99a19025a303d09a"> The fundamental question that must be answered is whether the benefits – that is, the added financial stability – warrant the risks. Here, the first thing to consider is why central banks started providing reserves to banks in the first place. During the 2008 crisis, trust in financial institutions’ creditworthiness collapsed, and the threat of contagion caused interbank money markets to freeze, forcing central banks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/us/politics/bailout-biden-financial-crisis.html">step in</a>. By providing liquidity directly to each market participant, monetary authorities effectively substituted their balance sheets for the money market. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c2ecad74e76473e8b10f8a3c09c5b62"> But there had to be a division between this new activity and the implementation of traditional monetary policy. Both the Fed and the ECB solved this problem in the same way: by paying interest on reserves. Rather than using market operations to increase or reduce the volume of reserves in the banking system, thereby steering its target interest rate, the central banks used the interest rate on reserve balances to steer the effective overnight rate. This enabled them to provide reserves to the point of satiation for financial-stability purposes, while continuing to guide short-term interest rates for monetary-policy purposes. </p>
<p data-line-id="a5d7aa32f6e4401da2103322426f6503"> Not surprisingly, this “ample reserves” approach caused central-bank balance sheets to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/12/pdf/dataspot.pdf">balloon</a>. It is also worth noting that, under this system, the size of the central bank’s balance sheet depends on market demand for liquidity, which has proved to be both variable and unpredictable. </p>
<p data-line-id="6b4bc3e6d92a412bad42614e9baaa390"> Some now say that <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1100.pdf">enough is enough</a>. The post-crisis monetary-policy regime, they say, was a justified response to a generalized credit crunch, but that it is not suited for normal times. Sustaining it is leading to the death of interbank money markets – which did have a valuable role to play in the economy – and causing banks to become dependent on central-bank liquidity. </p>
<p data-line-id="1cc3d12d5b1443769a082bfa17072902"> But these risks might be overstated. Central banks can, after all, offer liquidity at zero cost. Evidence <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20231722">suggests</a> that strong demand for central-bank reserves is a new structural feature of a market in which financial institutions have a strong preference for safety, and regulations that made them safer also made it very costly for them to hold less liquid assets. Why risk creating liquidity problems by abandoning a framework that has proved so robust? </p>
<p data-line-id="2a75d703a5314926a6149f9b0c7ad5c6"> The real issue is fiscal risk. Since large reserves must be backed by assets, mostly Treasuries, the new system implies larger interest-rate risks, implying that central banks’ actions now have a greater fiscal impact. Fluctuations in central banks’ net incomes have grown larger, and for some institutions, total net capital has moved into negative territory. </p>
<p data-line-id="114e1a264b194187af5e2ec06be0d6d5"> Is this a problem? In a unitary system, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, it merely implies a redistribution of risk within the government, between the central bank and the finance ministry. While this could create uncertainty about the institutional framework and potentially even undermine central-bank independence, these risks are probably not particularly acute. </p>
<p data-line-id="026be94309734eb88955e7fd196eec6d"> The situation is different in the eurozone, where there is no single fiscal authority or euro-denominated safe asset (a safe bond backed by the eurozone’s joint fiscal capacity), so the risks are not evenly distributed across countries. This is a fiscal problem, not a monetary one. Nonetheless, it raises doubts about whether the eurozone, with its current governance structure, can meet the high demand for safety among market participants. </p>
<p data-line-id="4e731c5818dd4563b7bf4ac23b0b5d7b"> Ultimately, the debate over the “normalization” of the post-crisis monetary-policy approach should focus on two questions. The first, which is relevant for all jurisdictions, is whether central-bank independence will go unchallenged when flows between the financial system and the Treasury are large. The second, which is relevant only for the eurozone, is whether the monetary union’s fragmented governance structure is fit for purpose in the post-financial-crisis world. It is not a new question. In the past, fragmentation emerged as an obstacle to stabilizing fiscal policy; today, it is re-emerging as a potential problem for the design of an ECB operational framework that can ensure financial stability and efficient monetary policy. </p>

<p data-line-id="eca1bfb90b7d4c81a3dface3466398fb"> TEL AVIV – Israel’s forceful military response to Hamas’s October 7 massacre has sparked massive demonstrations around the world. Amid the ongoing war in Gaza, Israel has once again been cast as an oppressive colonial power in many Western circles, with the chant “Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea” becoming a common rallying cry on college campuses and social-media platforms. </p><p data-line-id="1d37b48eb4304ef9af565fbd5e645c98"> But this perception has little to do with the reality on the ground. Contrary to what Hamas and its Western apologists believe, Israel’s sizeable Palestinian minority is not eager to be “decolonized.” A recent poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute found that despite not having full equality, the share of Palestinian Israelis who sympathize with the Jewish state <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-war-poll-finds-arab-israelis-sense-of-kinship-with-state-at-a-20-year-high/">has increased to 70%</a> since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, up from 48% in June. </p><p data-line-id="6c5b1f1102f84acc9e5422e6e67859a5"> While the colonial nature of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank is undeniable, it is also important to note that Palestinians’ Pavlovian <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/22/23971375/israel-palestine-peace-talks-deal-timeline">rejection</a> of Israel’s two peace proposals at the beginning of this century hastened the demise of the Israeli peace movement. The late Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat rejected the first proposal, the so-called Clinton peace parameters, in 2000 – a decision that was strongly condemned by the then-Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Bandar bin Sultan, who <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/03/24/the-prince-3">called</a> it a “crime against the Palestinian people.” </p>

<p data-line-id="36c9f37e13204e7a9845d94246c4bc2e"> AMSTERDAM – One of the biggest mistakes I ever made as a journalist was to underestimate Geert Wilders, now the leader (and <a href="https://www.parlement.com/id/vhnnmt7m4rqi/partij_voor_de_vrijheid_pvv">only formal member</a>) of the most popular political party in the Netherlands, and potentially the first <a href="https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-election-candidates-prime-minister-wilders-9ed5752f49315517876f1646d4c2d4f2">far-right prime minister</a> his country has ever known. </p><p data-line-id="a49230d642f244039ff3f209a8e00567"> I interviewed Wilders in 2005 for my book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297685/murder-in-amsterdam-by-ian-buruma/"><em>Murder in Amsterdam</em></a>, about the assassination of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim extremist. The Party for Freedom (PVV), founded by Wilders in 2006, did not exist yet. But I was interested in the views of an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-election-candidates-prime-minister-wilders-9ed5752f49315517876f1646d4c2d4f2">outspoken critic</a> of Islam, and of immigrants with a Muslim background. </p><p data-line-id="36b87adc55f74e329b2f5d2257e256d1"> Frankly, I thought he was a bore, with no political future, and did not quote him in my book. Like most people, I was struck by his rather weird hairstyle. Why would a grown man and member of parliament wish to <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/who-is-geert-wilders-20231123-p5em7r.html">dye</a> his fine head of dark hair platinum blond? In fact, he turned out to have been somewhat of a pioneer in this respect. The later successes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson demonstrated the importance of visual branding, of having a zany image boosted by the cultivation of odd hair. (Perhaps Hitler’s toothbrush moustache, or even Napoleon’s comb-over, was a harbinger.) </p>

A majority of the dead – at least <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/world-childrens-day-tragedy-gazas-5500-lives-lost-to-israels-attacks">5,500</a> – are children, which amounts to one Palestinian child killed every ten minutes, while an additional 1,800 children are missing, and presumed dead, under the rubble. </p><p data-line-id="ec904a143e744e48980f8c18775afac3"> The high death toll among young people partly reflects the fact that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206479861/israel-gaza-hamas-children-population-war-palestinians">nearly half of Gaza’s population</a> is under the age of 18.

(The aid agency Save the Children has <a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/news/children-s-mental-health-gaza-pushed-beyond-breaking-point-after-nearly-month-siege-and">warned</a> that children’s mental health in Gaza is being pushed beyond the breaking point.) </p><p data-line-id="702d0cd65ffe48a295635135df8a92ac"> The UN Security Council has <a href="https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/six-grave-violations/killing-and-maiming/#:~:text=Killing%20and%20maiming%20children%20during,children%20in%20times%20of%20war.">identified and condemned</a> the willful killing and maiming of children as one of “<a href="https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/six-grave-violations/">six grave violations</a>” of its 1999 resolution on children and armed conflict.

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="8a4154ebbd634fc99b81d111a2fcddd0"> BALTIMORE – As the start of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) approaches, those leading it continue to inspire concern and even indignation. After all, the host will be the United Arab Emirates, among the world’s largest oil-producing countries, and the head of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sultan-al-jaber">Sultan Al Jaber</a>, will be running the proceedings. But is that really so bad? </p>
<p data-line-id="152401fad49840a2ae98ced448d6ff3b"> The Middle East is not exactly the climate champion of our time. Regional leaders have historically doubted climate science and often refused to help poorer countries suffering from climate-related damage. But it is the role of Al Jaber himself that is most controversial. As US Representative Ro Khanna <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/05/23/cop28-climate-summit-sultan-al-jaber/">put it</a>, having the head of a national oil company as the president-designate of a climate conference is a “slap in the face to young climate activists.” </p>
<p data-line-id="5f941900f0c64d3baf18218f1d65b699"> This explains why, earlier this year, over 130 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/05/23/cop28-climate-summit-sultan-al-jaber/">signed a letter</a> calling for his removal. But while the developed world has largely balked at Al Jaber’s appointment, many developing countries openly support it. </p>
<p data-line-id="48664916de324a67a35e0bf54494cc3b"> The UN-sponsored global climate negotiations are intended to keep countries – both friends and rivals – engaged with one another and aware that, despite our differences, we all share a planet. While they tend to be dominated by the actors one might expect – developed countries like the United States, as well as rising powers like China – they are also one of the rare multilateral forums where questions of historical responsibility might be raised. </p>
<p data-line-id="6eba88189bde40f4975475eb1720f5b5"> To be sure, the advanced economies do not exactly reckon with their legacy of violent and extractive colonialism at COPs, even though that history directly enabled their industrialization and all the associated greenhouse-gas emissions. But, to some extent, they do acknowledge their disproportionate contributions to climate change. Meanwhile, smaller, poorer countries are granted a kind of moral authority and, often, the opportunity to exercise greater political voice than they have elsewhere. </p>
<p data-line-id="136c24cf81ce43f8872fbc1a549939f6"> My country, Bangladesh, is a case in point. In recent years, Bangladesh has been battered by severe cyclones and floods, which will only worsen as sea levels rise. And yet it accounts for just <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/10/31/key-highlights-country-climate-and-development-report-for-bangladesh">0.4%</a> of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="f1be1289854c4469aa5363c5c6d7110f"> Countless well-meaning academics and activists have underscored this imbalance, though often in simplistic and unconstructive ways. I distinctly remember watching with dread as a Western climate scientist recounted the real-world effects of climate change – and, in particular, the horrors that lay ahead for vulnerable countries – at a 2015 conference at the University of Oregon. When she brought up Bangladesh, she began to sob as she repeated her desperate question: “What have they done to deserve this?” Heads swiveled in my direction – I was the only Bangladeshi person at the conference – but I could only sit slumped at my seat, skewered by a lance of pity and liberal guilt. </p>
<p data-line-id="2b4825f1628b495480f519c15208b03b"> As an anthropologist who has studied COPs for nearly a decade, I have watched developing countries approach climate negotiations in surprising and creative ways. And I can assure you Bangladesh is not as hapless as that panel speaker implied. As the sociologist Kasia Paprocki has <a href="http://www.kasiapaprocki.com/uploads/5/5/8/1/55818931/paprocki_threatening_dystopias_development_and_adaptation_regimes_in_bangladesh.pdf">observed</a>, the highly market-friendly Bangladesh has turned climate-change adaptation into an economic opportunity. Similarly, the anthropologist Jason Cons has <a href="http://www.jasoncons.net/uploads/1/4/9/7/14977250/cons_staging_climate_security.pdf">pointed out</a> that Bangladesh has managed to cultivate the contradictory image of a country on the brink of ruin from climate change and one flush with economic opportunity. </p>
<p data-line-id="a335806ba61c41aebe4f52769bfaf45f"> At COPs, Bangladesh has distinguished itself as a <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/32nd-anniversary/towards-smart-bangladesh/news/bangladeshs-key-role-combatting-climate-change-3244346">leader</a> on the issue of loss and damage. While the emotional theatrics are unnecessary, it bears repeating that, in countries like Bangladesh, people are already losing their homes, livelihoods, and lives to the effects of climate change. Even if the world begins to reduce emissions rapidly, these losses will not be undone. </p>
<p data-line-id="cf0d3a1dbeb4483c8385b36c5b30982a"> Loss and damage makes developed countries nervous. If they acknowledge that climate change cannot be fully mitigated, and that there are limits to human and ecosystem adaptation, the next logical step could well be to seek legal means of pressuring them to pay far more to compensate climate-vulnerable countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="0ba64d7ea060491598bd14be56e7a6af"> Recognizing this, Bangladesh initially took a diplomatic approach to the issue of loss and damage: instead of pushing developed economies to assume liability, it advocated protections for climate-displaced refugees, such as a resettlement policy or a refugee-coordination agency. A Bangladeshi delegate was involved in the creation of the <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/loss-and-damage/warsaw-international-mechanism#:~:text=of%20the%20COP.-,Functions%20of%20the%20Loss%20and%20Damage%20Mechanism,pursuant%20to%20decision%203%2FCP.">Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage</a> in 2013, and Bangladeshi voices contributed to the <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/everything-you-need-know-about-the-loss-and-damage-fund-3239621">agreement</a> to establish a Loss and Damage Fund at last year’s COP. </p>
<p data-line-id="285dd894e8ce42c2b4c48f33f60a4750"> Bangladesh is also a member of the <a href="https://www.gktoday.in/what-are-like-minded-developing-countries-lmdcs/#:~:text=Member%20countries%20of%20the%20Like,Sudan%2C%20Vietnam%2C%20and%20Zimbabwe.">Like-Minded Developing Countries</a>, established in 2012 to keep the needs and interests of the Global South on the COP agenda. Not all the LMDC’s members, from Pakistan to China, have the moral authority of Bangladesh when it comes to climate change. Hearing Saudi Arabia, for example, weigh in on historical emissions or debt distress is a bit rich. But wealthier Middle Eastern countries lend a certain rhetorical and political heft to the LMDC’s cause. This might explain why so many poorer countries, including Bangladesh, are coming out in support of a COP host that continues to woo oil companies even as it advocates for green energy. </p>
<p data-line-id="f9a0ea75405b458fa83d5e964e22ecb4"> In this sense, the leadership of the UAE and Al Jaber may not be out of line with the goals of young climate activists after all. On the contrary, the future these activists seek to avoid is already the reality for countries like Bangladesh. Effective action on loss and damage today – the action the Global South is fighting for – would thus serve everyone’s interests. Any effort by the UAE to use its position to advance progress on this front should be welcomed. </p>

<p data-line-id="17fa73d544ba4c8888d799f211d8c86e"> CAMBRIDGE – Ethiopia has long suffered from recurrent large-scale famines, most notably in the <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/1980s-ethiopia-famine-facts">early 1980s</a>, when at least one million people died, and millions more were displaced. This year, however, Ethiopia has become a <a href="https://fas.usda.gov/data/ethiopia-ethiopia-expected-export-wheat-first-time-summer-production-progresses-nicely">net exporter of wheat</a> for the first time, an extraordinary feat given its <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/14/how-africa-can-escape-chronic-food-insecurity-amid-climate-change">vulnerability</a> to climate change and food-security crises. </p>
<p data-line-id="4689ac7654b3418ca1e7e6fc13e434af"> While many factors contributed to this accomplishment, it mainly reflects the central role that new technologies have played in transforming Ethiopia’s agricultural sector. By boosting crop yields and building resilience to extreme weather, these innovations have proven particularly helpful in regions facing worsening droughts and other climate risks. </p>
<p data-line-id="6522b7d0a5e74aa5bdf840f9cca195e8"> The <a href="https://ifdc.org/projects/technologies-for-african-agricultural-transformation-taat-soil-fertility-enabler/">Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation</a> (TAAT) program, established by the International Fertilizer Development Center, has been instrumental in deploying proven and high-performance agricultural technologies at scale, with the aim of helping farmers increase the production of millet, maize, rice, wheat, and other staples. As a result of the yield-increasing performance of these technologies, the area allocated to heat-tolerant wheat varieties in Ethiopia has grown from 5,000 hectares in 2018 to more than <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/speeches/opening-keynote-speech-dr-akinwumi-adesina-president-african-development-bank-group-koafec-ministerial-conference-republic-korea-13-september-2023-64257">2.2 million hectares</a> in 2023, putting the country on the path to food self-sufficiency. </p>
<p data-line-id="979c3f2bd9fd42418337f92293ff76f6"> The “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/498398e7-11b1-494b-9cd3-6d669dc3de33">polycrisis</a>” world of increasingly volatile global supply chains has accelerated the drive toward greater self-reliance. The war in Ukraine triggered a <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/04/28/blog-africa-faces-new-shock-as-war-raises-food-fuel-costs">surge in food prices</a> in Africa, with the wheat sub-index, for example, reaching a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/ukrainian-grain-exports-explained/">multiyear high</a> in May 2022. Ethiopia was <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/pillar-of-economic-security-ralph-ossa">hit particularly hard</a>, because it had been importing almost half of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Now the continent is reeling from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/416736ec-7960-496d-b6c8-fd7a2fd99668">the export ban</a> that India, the world’s largest rice exporter, recently imposed on several varieties. </p>
<p data-line-id="7725c31c582246fcab7f4434818d187c"> Amid this challenging environment, the Ethiopian government’s remarkable ability to use technology to boost domestic production and to reduce the risks associated with over-reliance on food imports may well represent a breakthrough. Such progress, especially in a country that was an agricultural basket case for several humiliating decades, offers hope for Africa, which has been on the frontline of the climate crisis, with food insecurity often fueling political unrest. </p>
<p data-line-id="adf53803210b45a492e7d46676b462dd"> Consider, for example, that cereal yields in Africa have stagnated to 1,589 kilograms per hectare, far below the global average of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.YLD.CREL.KG?locations=ZG-1W">4,153 kilograms</a>. There are many reasons for this, but chief among them is the chronic technological deficit. The lack of agro-processing and high value-added industries is another longstanding hurdle to increasing agricultural output and productivity growth on the continent, and has also exacerbated post-harvest losses estimated at about <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-reducing-post-harvest-losses-is-a-priority-for-africa-87312">30-50%</a> of total food production in Africa. </p>
<p data-line-id="9f0dbf626b714ba9b60f74a30e1dc814"> Compounding the problem is the limited use of fertilizer on the continent and excessive dependence on rainfed agriculture. At around 7.6 million metric tons in 2021, fertilizer use is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1265868/global-fertilizer-consumption-by-nutrient-and-region/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20region%20with,tons%20of%20fertilizers%20that%20year">far lower</a> than in East Asia (61.9 million metric tons) and South Asia (38.7 million metric tons), while the dearth of irrigation systems and other water-management tools is especially worrisome in light of the accelerating pace of global warming. These shortcomings have precipitated a rise in extreme hunger, with many communities on the continent facing the <a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/stories/disasters-and-emergencies/world/africa-hunger-crisis-100-million-struggling-to-eat">worst food crisis</a> in 40 years. </p>
<p data-line-id="d705e6149b0f45249a1ae984bd0c621f"> But the consequences of geopolitical upheaval and intensifying climate risks extend beyond food security to create a vicious cycle of droughts, floods, macroeconomic instability, and balance-of-payments crises across the continent. Around <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/14/how-africa-can-escape-chronic-food-insecurity-amid-climate-change">85%</a> of the food in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is imported, largely owing to the region’s weather-sensitive agriculture. The continent now spends around <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/dakar-2-summit-feed-africa-food-sovereignty-and-resilience/q-and-dakar-2-summit">$75 billion</a> annually on cereal imports, depleting foreign-exchange reserves and increasing exchange-rate pressures. (Most African currencies <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijz--HgKuCAxW1XEEAHTdvD_QQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2F-%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FPublications%2FREO%2FAFR%2F2023%2FApril%2FEnglish%2FExchangeNote.ashx&amp;usg=AOvVaw0YigtdLWEzaHPpZ6un3xqc&amp;opi=89978449">depreciated sharply</a> in 2022, with the Ethiopian birr growing especially weak.) This import dependence negatively affects the balance of payments, with increasingly frequent global supply shocks exacerbating the region’s vulnerability.  </p>
<p data-line-id="2888a147d55d4423898ca168181f8370"> Africa’s food-import bill is set to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/africa-needs-up-to-65-billion-loans-yearly-to-curb-food-imports#xj4y7vzkg">rise dramatically</a> in the coming years, partly because of geopolitically induced shocks and <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population">projected population growth</a>. But global warming will also fuel this surge. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, <a href="https://www.germanwatch.org/en/19777">five of the ten countries</a> most affected by climate change in 2019 were in SSA, where one-third of the world’s droughts occur but less than <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/14/how-africa-can-escape-chronic-food-insecurity-amid-climate-change">1% of arable land</a> is equipped with irrigation. The World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Full_Report_Vol_2_Turn_Down_The_Heat_%20Climate_Extremes_Regional_Impacts_Case_for_Resilience_Print%20version_FINAL.pdf">estimates</a> that, if global temperatures rise to 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050, crop production in SSA will decrease by 10%. </p>
<p data-line-id="83b22c28856f44a4acf5eacd1de3d024"> Such a gloomy prediction may well come true. This year is on track to be the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/04/world/september-hottest-record-2023-climate-intl/index.html">hottest on record</a>, around 1.4°C above pre-industrial average temperatures. Moreover, if greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise at current rates, climate models predict an <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/predictions-future-global-climate">additional 4°C</a> of warming during this century. The need for greater investment in climate mitigation and adaptation has never been clearer. </p>
<p data-line-id="a21c8d62ca7a489e8a8e540184f589a4"> Faced with over-reliance on food imports and daunting climate forecasts, Africa must move away from the traditional rainfed model of agricultural production. Following Ethiopia’s lead, the continent should embrace technology to boost agricultural productivity and improve food security. This will require aggressive investment in precision-agriculture technologies, such as variable-rate irrigation, that maximize productivity in a resource-constrained environment. </p>
<p data-line-id="c90fb1ab6c4943398c98167f0e0e923a"> In addition to water-saving innovations, policymakers should invest in high-yield seed varieties that perform well under dry conditions and in agricultural equipment to mechanize the sector. Improved infrastructure, including solar-powered irrigation systems and digital technologies that allow farmers to access early-warning systems and improve efficiency, will also be essential. </p>
<p data-line-id="5b900b64e3064600b8ae09ac46ae4812"> Deploying a wide range of technologies to transform Africa’s agriculture sector will address food-security concerns as well as environmental and sustainability issues. Such a move is long overdue: even though Africa is home to more than <a href="https://www.fao.org/family-farming/detail/en/c/1507024/">60%</a> of the world’s uncultivated arable land, it has yet to benefit from the green revolution that has boosted yields elsewhere. The harsh realities of climate change and geopolitical upheaval may finally create sufficiently strong incentives to unlock the continent’s potential and ensure greater self-sufficiency and resilience in food production. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="a6e9c4e9205b410a81a8dd82ad41f245"> CAMBRIDGE/DURHAM/LANCASTER – From the European Union’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/green-deal-industrial-plan_en">Green Deal Industrial Plan</a> and the United States’ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA) to Japan’s <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100153688.pdf">Green Growth Strategy</a> and the <a href="https://www.iea.org/policies/11514-korean-new-deal-digital-new-deal-green-new-deal-and-stronger-safety-net">Korean New Deal</a>, industrial policies aimed at accelerating the energy transition are proliferating in wealthy, technologically advanced economies. Many developing economies are also designing and deploying state-led projects to foster green industrialization, as competition intensifies for electric vehicles (EVs), so-called <a href="https://resourcegovernance.org/topics/transition-minerals">transition minerals</a>, and clean energy. </p>
<p data-line-id="fe8f1f03a3394573b685b56ee2208d28"> For example, several African countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Mauritania, Egypt, Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco, and Namibia, have enacted state-led initiatives to support the development of <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/event/green-hydrogen-for-africa/">green hydrogen</a>. Others, including Indonesia, Bolivia, and Chile, are implementing national strategies to stimulate industrialization based on the <a href="https://repositorio.cepal.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/8d505030-7686-44e1-9f60-77ceb0610826/content">extraction and processing</a> of nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, and other transition minerals and metals. </p>
<p data-line-id="7255b4df019e4ce6953170788d92d522"> These policies use a broad range of instruments – including subsidies, regulations, incentives, and diverse state-business arrangements – and differ widely in terms of the public and private resources at their disposal. But they all seek to tackle three crises simultaneously: economic stagnation, polarized and precarious employment, and intensifying climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="d043ed2372fb4b2ab20ebf02d5bdc2c6"> The revival of industrial policy is based on the logic that addressing all three crises will create a virtuous cycle: targeted investment in green manufacturing and energy will boost economic activity, create well-paying jobs, and usher in a low-carbon economy. The Biden administration’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/">modern American industrial strategy</a>,” comprising the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the IRA, exemplifies this approach. What has been called the “<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RI_Industrial-Policy-Synergies-Reflections-from-Biden-Administration-Alumni_Report_202304.pdf">Biden three-fer</a>” is designed to boost US competitiveness in key industries vis-à-vis China, provide better economic opportunities for American workers, and accelerate decarbonization. </p>
<p data-line-id="8bcdba880b1e43ecaa5b3e4b159aa10a"> But the win-win narrative undergirding these new industrial strategies tends to obfuscate the risk that solving one problem may exacerbate another. In fact, the tensions between these policy objectives are already visible. For example, the decarbonization of the economy may not create as many decent jobs as initially expected. In the US, both car companies and the United Auto Workers union have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/business/electric-vehicles-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis.html">warned</a> that the shift to manufacturing EVs, which require fewer parts, could lead to job losses. Some of these jobs will be redistributed to battery production, but this may be cold comfort for American and European auto workers, given China’s dominance over the global battery supply chain. </p>
<p data-line-id="92f48b7d78444447ace101cddd3a43c2"> At the same time, the growth of green industries can result in other environmental harms. Despite aiming to generate employment and value through the production of transition minerals, the industrialization strategies of several Global South countries tend to entrench extractive practices. For example, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile – South America’s “<a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/lithium-triangle/">lithium triangle</a>” – are seeking to capture various stages of the <a href="https://repositorio.cepal.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/8d505030-7686-44e1-9f60-77ceb0610826/content">lithium supply chain</a>, from mineral extraction to processing to battery assembly. But the growth of this industry threatens to deplete water supplies, degrade soil, and disrupt habitats, often in zones inhabited by indigenous Andean peoples. Similarly, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02839">production of semiconductors</a>, which are at the heart of clean tech, is energy-, water-, and land-intensive and releases <a href="https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/f-gas-partnership-programs/semiconductor-industry">perfluorocarbons</a> and other potent greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. </p>
<p data-line-id="23135f017735422795093af48852cb63"> Finally, economic stagnation can have a destabilizing impact on domestic politics, impelling governments to aim for a higher growth rate regardless of the environmental costs. For example, British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/rishi-sunak">Rishi Sunak</a> recently announced a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-net-zero-20-september-2023">series of U-turns</a> on the government’s net-zero pledges. Shedding burdensome climate commitments may seem like a politically attractive strategy to boost immediate growth prospects. But – and herein lies the contradiction – longer-term growth will at least partly depend on governments ensuring that their economies are competitive in the green industries of the future. </p>
<p data-line-id="52f9f5cc7e384f68910a6a96f8d772d6"> As these examples show, industrial policy is not a silver bullet for the intersecting crises of our times. The policy objectives of environmental sustainability, industrial dynamism, and full employment are difficult to reconcile and require hard political choices about resource allocation, strategic priorities, and, crucially, the distribution of economic and social costs. Moreover, the trade-offs will grow more complex and challenging as global warming worsens and growth continues to sputter. What we <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718523000179">call</a> the “wicked trinity” of contemporary governance – climate catastrophe, economic stagnation, and surplus humanity – will not go away anytime soon. In fact, it will likely shape the trajectories of public policymaking long into the future. </p>
<p data-line-id="ebc2bb82f85b48a5b14f57de53f21f6e"> This is not to say that policymakers should give up on designing ambitious strategies to address these crises. On the contrary, swift and effective action is an absolute necessity. Yet packaging these plans in win-win narratives that paper over the difficult trade-offs they involve significantly raises the risk that governments will lose popular support. The complex and conflicting nature of these policy objectives means that even the best-designed strategies will fall short, at least in some respects. This is unavoidable and an important component of learning-by-doing. </p>
<p data-line-id="846e499980bc41a0a5e62ed29dd080ed"> To avoid being seen as breaking promises, policymakers must embrace, rather than dismiss, the tensions and trade-offs at the heart of green industrial policies and subject them to public deliberation. This is essential to securing broad support for state-led decarbonization projects. Such an approach would help build robust, transparent governance structures rooted in the principles of democratic deliberation and public oversight and control. As matters stand now, many industrial strategies are the product of top-down, technocratic policymaking processes, despite all the talk of “leaving no community behind” and a “just green transition.” </p>
<p data-line-id="b9f8b62e934348e482158ac4e610dac8"> Subjecting the economy to democratic decision-making in this way would, admittedly, constitute a radical challenge to the current system of private ownership and market coordination. But it is essential to secure and maintain popular legitimacy for green industrial policies, as well as to facilitate <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RI_What-US-Policymakers-Can-Learn-from-International-Examples-of-Democratic-Governance_Brief_202310.pdf">collective and efficient decision-making</a> and minimize mismanagement. Otherwise, we risk a public backlash that impedes the collective action needed to safeguard our future on this planet. </p>

<p data-line-id="0332918e030b409eb898c171e086a1ab"> MADRID – Faced with many differences between its member states, the European Union has sought to refine its concept of strategic autonomy over the past few years. Now, Spain intends to use its EU Council presidency to bring greater coherence and substance to this debate. If it succeeds, Europe will have taken a significant step toward deeper integration. </p><p data-line-id="09cb24268cc14f47840e2607ff73c9ee"> The concept of strategic autonomy has already evolved considerably. Originating in the defense sphere, it first appeared in an <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-217-2013-INIT/en/pdf">official EU document</a> in 2013. It then became a foreign-policy principle in the EU’s 2016 <a href="https://www.coe-civ.eu/kh/a-global-strategy-for-the-european-unions-foreign-and-security-policy">Global Strategy</a>, before finally extending to the economic realm with the bloc’s new commitment to “<a href="https://spanish-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/programme/open-strategic-autonomy-spanish-presidency-eu-council-resilient-eu2030/">open strategic autonomy</a>” in 2020. </p><p data-line-id="a2219df784794855bee96e0b59542d0f"> The basic idea is that Europeans must be able to live by their own laws and defend their interests without foreign interference (or assistance). Yet given the EU’s cooperative nature, consensus-based decision-making, and deep economic ties to the rest of the world, external action must strike a delicate balance. It must be multilateral when possible, but unilateral when necessary. </p>

<p data-line-id="05eb1a2d609d477c8f16f95f9b2ca254"> CAMBRIDGE – Vitamin C may not be particularly effective at preventing the common cold or treating cancer (notwithstanding Linus Pauling’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7547741/vitamin-c-myth-pauling">claims to the contrary</a>), but a lack of it can cause scurvy. As a result, daily consumption is essential to a healthy diet. In contrast, penicillin cures bacterial infections, although its overuse can lead to drug-resistant germs. It should thus be taken only when absolutely necessary. </p><p data-line-id="7fe8347f52db418b8bb8da23b9a314a0"> So, is industrial policy more like vitamin C or penicillin? Can a deficiency lead to problems, meaning that regular, modest amounts are crucial to a well-functioning economy? Or should it be used sparingly to combat a particular type of infection? </p><p data-line-id="60eae71dc4e84fae8aa4fbe2841610f7"> In this context, infections represent market failures, which many economists tend to see more as the exception than the rule. They would argue that leaving the body to cure itself is better than intervening. As the old joke goes, an untreated cold lasts a week, whereas a treated cold lasts seven days. The late Nobel laureate <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/gary-s-becker">Gary Becker</a> famously <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdp20151wade_en.pdf">quipped</a> that “the best industrial policy is none at all.” </p>

<p data-line-id="07d5d57637a4480ea6bd9be7e19900a6"> NEW YORK – Since the publication of <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/nouriel-roubini/megathreats/9780316284059/?lens=little-brown"><em>Megathreats</em></a> in October 2022, the themes I emphasized have gone mainstream. Everyone now acknowledges that economic, monetary, and financial threats are rising and interacting in dangerous ways with various other social, political, geopolitical, environmental, health, and technological developments. Hence, in December 2022, the <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6c4f63c-aa71-46f0-a0a7-c2a4c4a3c0f1">chose</a> “polycrisis” as one of its buzzwords of the year. Whatever one’s preferred term (others have adopted “permacrisis” or “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/imf-economy-faces-confluence-of-calamities-in-biggest-test-since-world-war-ii.html">confluence of calamities</a>”), there is growing recognition that not only the global economy but also human survival is at risk.  </p><p data-line-id="226b06e5588d46ab82c35c0f35224b9f"> As I warned in <em>Megathreats</em>, the “Great Moderation” (a long period of low macroeconomic volatility following the mid-1980s) has given way to the “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stagflationary-debt-crisis-is-here-by-nouriel-roubini-2022-10">Great Stagflation</a>.” In 2022, we witnessed a surge of inflation in advanced economies and emerging markets, a sharp slowdown of global growth that continued into 2023, and signs of severe private- and public-sector debt problems as central banks raised policy rates to stabilize prices. </p><p data-line-id="ccc556169b084fb39f0c61acd2fa2c63"> Owing to this monetary-policy tightening, inflation has fallen around the world; moreover, the impact of stagflationary short-term negative supply shocks – the pandemic, the commodity-price spike following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and China’s “zero-COVID” policy – has been gradually fading throughout 2023. But inflation remains well above the 2% target in advanced economies, and a dozen other medium-term negative aggregate supply shocks discussed in <em>Megathreats</em> have grown more severe. </p>

<p data-line-id="072d00df94ef4de4886c5fd00ca4bd2a">After more than a month of relentless bombardment and an escalating ground assault by Israel, Palestinians in Gaza are getting a brief respite, thanks to an agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of at least 50 Israeli women and children held hostage in the enclave. But, unless a durable solution is found, the fighting will soon resume, and a dire humanitarian situation will deteriorate further.</p>
<p data-line-id="d3eaeb836c084b6a886e8bfe83b5d136">The only way to avoid “eternal war,” former Swedish Prime Minister <strong>Carl Bildt</strong> argues, is to “take decisive steps toward a two-state solution.” Such an effort faces “huge” obstacles, not least the “increase in support for violence among Palestinians who have grown frustrated to the point of despair” and “the inclusion of fundamentalist Jewish settlers in the current Israeli government.” The key to overcoming them is to “use the renewed prospect of a two-state solution to galvanize moderate forces on both sides.”</p>
<p data-line-id="8eb0bb6e6f3f45158700994a3f7c42ca"><strong>Raja Khalidi</strong>, Director-General of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, highlights another barrier to a two-state solution: “the creation of an independent Palestinian state requires a viable Palestinian economy,” which is practically “impossible” to imagine following the destruction of Gaza. “Even at this dark hour,” however, “there may still be a chance to forge a ‘real’ two-state deal,” because – thanks to the Palestinian economists and planners who have spent decades “preparing the economic foundations of a sovereign state of Palestine” – we already know what it must include.</p>
<p data-line-id="cc9e2358dfe142a6837d37652e369c8d">Likewise, New America CEO <strong>Anne-Marie Slaughter</strong> points out that what currently seems diplomatically impossible should never be ruled out. In Europe, just six years after World War II, centuries-long enemies established the European Coal and Steel Community, which “would prevent them from forging weapons to be used against one another ever again.” This experience offers important lessons for supporters of the two-state solution, who should “start small” by cooperating on issues like water management and green energy, while engaging with “well-meaning and likeminded third parties.” </p>

<p data-line-id="a4c080c62cfb481ebeeb44b608f8d117"> WARSAW – Consider the following three-scene play. In the first scene, it is October 10, 2023. Jarosław Kaczyński, the soon-to-be-deposed little “Big Man” of Poland’s populist ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), does what he does on the tenth day of every month. He lays flowers at the monument commemorating his twin brother, then-President Lech Kaczyński, and 95 others who died when their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/07/pilots-plane-crash-smolensk-polish-president-pressured-land-thick-fog">plane</a> tried to land in thick fog at Smolensk airfield in Russia, in April 2010. </p><p data-line-id="ccf2572c2c3f49b393ff4834da5f4ad8"> Meanwhile, Zbigniew Komosa, a Polish entrepreneur who carries out a similar ritual on the tenth day of every month, lays a wreath commemorating the victims of the crash. But pinned to his offering is a <a href="https://en.odfoundation.eu/a/190999,polish-public-prosecutors-office-selected-cases-of-malicious-prosecution-and-dereliction-of-duties/">note</a> that reads: “In memory of the 95 victims of Lech Kaczyński, who, ignoring all regulations, ordered the pilots to land in extremely hazardous conditions. May you rest in peace.” </p><p data-line-id="fb71803c0a394334a2e976f13548b065"> Every month, Kaczyński has had Komosa’s wreath removed. This time, however, the police attending Kaczyński are somehow less eager to do so, and Kaczyński must do it himself. He tears the note off and carries the wreath away from the monument to cries of “thief” from Komosa and a friend who is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khC1cUP5QUY">filming</a> the entire incident. Kaczyński then demands that the police arrest the wreath-layers or at least take down their names, while Komosa demands that they arrest Kaczyński for stealing private property. </p>

With the trial having once again revealed the prevalence of anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry, big corporations are turning to Congress to block the two federal agencies tasked with antitrust enforcement, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, from ramping up their efforts after decades of neglect. </p><p data-line-id="6d3867e46b5a47a8bf09769ab9df5251"> In the Google trial, the Justice Department argues that the company has a monopoly over “<a href="https://time.com/6324490/google-antitrust-trial/">general search</a>” and related markets, and that it has illegally maintained this monopoly by, among other things, paying other tech firms to incorporate its search engine into browsers and devices such as smartphones. Google paid Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">$18 billion</a> in 2021 alone. Though iPhone users can change the search-engine default by going into the settings menu, hardly anyone does. </p><p data-line-id="d56a2abcd4ed4f77835dd9575238ef60"> For its part, Google argues that people <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-takes-google-much-anticipated-antitrust-trial-2023-09-12/">prefer</a> its search engine, and that Apple therefore might as well make it the default. But if everyone preferred the Google search engine, Google would not need to pay Apple billions of dollars every year to make it the default, nor would it be so worried (as Google’s CEO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/technology/google-antitrust-trial-defense.html">apparently was</a>) about Apple deliberately degrading the Google search experience. </p>

<p data-line-id="5e883a05f57449a2bb6157f0e8c46355"> NEW YORK – At their recent summit in San Francisco, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a few <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/15/politics/takeaways-biden-xi-summit/index.html">important issues</a>. Notably, the two countries will resume military-to-military communication, thereby reducing the chances of an accidental conflict, and China will do more to restrict the export of chemicals used to make the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl – a major cause of death in the United States. But there is one crucial area where progress remained elusive: <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react-what-did-biden-and-xis-candid-meeting-accomplish/">tariffs</a>. </p><p data-line-id="235ab426fd814f5d891d46466bd9195a"> In 2018, then-US President Donald Trump’s administration hiked the tariff rate on imports from China from <a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart#:~:text=The%20months%20of%20July%20through,7.2%20percent%20to%2018.3%20percent.">slightly over 3%</a> to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/US-imposes-new-China-tariffs-raising-levies-to-pre-WWII-level">more than 21%</a> – a level unseen in the US since before World War II. This prompted China to retaliate with higher tariffs on US imports from about 8% to some 19%. As China also <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/202204/how-us-china-trade-war-affected-rest-world#:~:text=In%202018%20and%202019%2C%20the,the%20rest%20of%20the%20world">lowered its tariffs</a> on imports from all other countries, it reduced the competitiveness of US goods in the Chinese market by an even greater amount. </p><p data-line-id="f94da9f8d6e74b839b88c2a52838f8f4"> At the end of 2019, Trump and Xi reached a “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-11/u-s-china-said-to-reach-partial-deal-could-set-up-trade-truce-k1melw60">phase one</a>” agreement that froze the tariffs. The deal was a coercive one, designed to compel China to increase imports from the US at the expense of other trading partners, using means that are <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/world-trade-organization-rules-u-s-tariffs-on-china-are-illegal">illegal</a> under World Trade Organization rules. Ultimately, China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/china-failed-to-buy-agreed-amounts-of-us-goods-in-phase-one-trade-deal-data.html">could not fulfill</a> its purchase commitments. In any case, a WTO panel ruled in 2020 that the Trump tariffs are <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/world-trade-organization-rules-u-s-tariffs-on-china-are-illegal">incompatible</a> with America’s legal obligation to abide by the organization’s rules. </p>

<p data-line-id="4a9c770540204d40bb7b4d0777a8f124"> BERLIN – The recent worldwide surge of inflation is forcing political change, reminding us how efficiently this old economic problem can topple governments. In democracies, election outcomes often hinge on price developments. But the effect on autocracies is no less pronounced, because inflation erodes the implicit social compact on which they base their authority. </p><p data-line-id="8092cfce36bc46a58fedb8b7e5fc6d80"> In Argentina, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67470549">election</a> of a radical self-styled <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/argentine-presidential-candidate-javier-milei-libertarian-populism-by-matt-zwolinski-2023-10">anarcho-capitalist</a>, Javier Milei, as president can be understood as the immediate consequence of the incumbent Peronist regime’s inability to deal with inflation, which has hit an annualized rate of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/cant-buy-new-jeans-argentinas-100-inflation-draws-crowds-used-clothes-markets-2023-11-13/">143%</a>. Milei’s most important campaign <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/14/javier-milei-argentine-presidential-candidate-wants-to-abolish-central-bank.html">promise</a> was to restore price stability by abolishing the central bank and replacing the Argentine peso with the US dollar. </p><p data-line-id="8c2f79a02112427495a63e61ce7c2e90"> Ending monetary autonomy is obviously a bold and risky experiment that will severely limit government action. But that is exactly the point. Since the previous government tried to do too much, and manifestly failed, voters now feel as though anything would be better than more mismanagement. </p>

<p data-line-id="179947dfa45341a5a8ed54a94200091c"> BERLIN – In 1951, just six years after World War II, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Paris, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. </p><p data-line-id="3569efda814140419ccf02b43cd1f746"> It was a remarkable achievement, considering that France and Germany had fought three major wars between 1870 and 1945, leading to millions of deaths, the ravaging of lands and cities, and territorial conquest on both sides. Even decades later, my Belgian mother, who fled the German occupation of Brussels as a child with her mother and brother, trembled at the sight of a German customs uniform. Yet these former enemies agreed to pool their coal and steel production in ways that would prevent them from forging weapons to be used against one another ever again. </p><p data-line-id="2d018ae0b9294860965508fac6688151"> At a stroke, a handful of visionary statesmen – Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet of France, Konrad Adenauer of West Germany, and Alcide de Gasperi of Italy – laid the foundation for a new European future. The “Old Continent” of religious and nationalist wars, great-power intrigue, secret diplomacy, and the endless redrawing of national boundaries (with little regard for the people within them) became a new kind of political entity. After being conceived as a community, it eventually grew into a “union” of nation-states that retained enough of their sovereignty to act both independently and together. </p>

<p data-line-id="b0187a91ec6f4802b961c0d20288419c"> EDINBURGH – The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai is just weeks away. But it has become increasingly clear that only a bold financing initiative spearheaded by the United Arab Emirates could provide essential funding and support to the Global South. </p>
<p data-line-id="011be2acbc2d4adbbf661a5deed7a59c"> Despite being preceded by a summer of devastating droughts, floods, and wildfires that underscored the need for urgent action, the pre-summit talks on a <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-cop27-loss-and-damage-fund">Loss and Damage Fund</a> to help the world’s most impoverished countries mitigate the effects of climate change have made little progress. The fund, it was decided, will be housed for <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-the-fight-over-the-loss-and-damage-fund-for-climate-change/#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20the%20final,to%20pay%20into%20the%20fund.">four years</a> at the World Bank – but there has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/world-bank-poised-host-climate-loss-damage-fund-despite-concerns-2023-11-04/#:~:text=The%20deal%20to%20create%20a,of%20resistance%20from%20wealthy%20nations.s">no agreement</a> on the obligations of the historic emitters and, as yet, no substantial flows of cash. </p>
<p data-line-id="1ca21511447a4fddbfe7278dbb18c767"> As the president of COP28, the UAE’s <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sultan-al-jaber">Sultan Al Jaber</a> faces the crucial task of breaking the current impasse and delivering on his <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/19/cop28-president-unga-transform-climate-finance-bridge-trillion-gap-environment-politics-sultan-al-jaber/">promise</a> to devise a funding plan to bridge the Global South’s annual <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/cop-27-developing-countries-need-1-trillion-year-climate-finance-report-2022-11-08/">$1 trillion shortfall</a> in financing for mitigation and adaptation initiatives. </p>
<p data-line-id="b1ea419422b74f128d158e91201c5c0e"> The UAE holds the key to closing the climate financing gap. Persuading the world’s wealthiest petrostates to pay a <a href="https://gordonandsarahbrown.com/2023/09/press-release-rich-petro-states-should-pay-25bn-global-windfall-levy-to-fight-climate-change/#:~:text=He%20says%3A%20%E2%80%9CPetro%2Dstates,to%20an%20unprecedented%20%244%20trillion.%E2%80%9D">3% voluntary tax</a> on their windfall 2022 revenues from oil and gas exports could raise $25 billion. Such a levy could provide the initial capital required to motivate the developed economies that account for most global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions to issue guarantees that would enable multilateral development banks (MDBs) to boost investment. </p>
<p data-line-id="7a06f16db2e64c74ba420a431b9e78db"> To be sure, Al Jaber is well aware of the urgent need for decisive action. In June, in a private communication to some governments, he emphasized the importance of adopting a coordinated strategy that would use state guarantees to leverage private capital, reflecting the UAE’s vision of new, innovative financial mechanisms to leverage <a href="https://sustainability.freshfields.com/post/102is1l/road-to-cop28-climate-finance-unlocking-private-capital-to-beat-climate-change">private finance</a>. He also wants to use large-scale state-guarantee mechanisms to mobilize significant private investments, framing this as a way to unite all parties and stakeholders in promoting climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="0273c32893604348937c6b3585cffd1c"> But Al Jaber is not just the president of COP28; he is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. He is uniquely positioned to lead by example and steer his own country toward contributing its fair share. A $25 billion levy, representing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-industry-earned-4-trillion-last-year-says-iea-chief-2023-02-14/#:~:text=OSLO%2C%20Feb%2014%20(Reuters),Fatih%20Birol%2C%20said%20on%20Tuesday.">less than 10% </a>of the oil and gas industry’s annual revenues in 2022, should be considered the minimum contribution expected from major oil-exporting countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="14faf74ce63a4fa0b1e5cabe3b799de0"> The stark contrast between the oil-producing countries’ record-breaking export earnings and the millions of people across the Global South pushed into poverty by soaring electricity costs underscores this imperative. In 2022, the export earnings of OPEC countries alone totaled <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/OPEC_Revenues_Fact_Sheet">$888 billion</a>, a $266 billion increase from the previous year. The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/OPEC_Revenues_Fact_Sheet">six wealthiest</a> oil exporters alone raked in roughly $800 billion. The UAE’s own oil-export earnings soared from $76 billion in 2021 to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/OPEC_Revenues_Fact_Sheet">$119 billion</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="48e940e049094a37b04bd86e6f4b4810"> The surge in energy prices has been particularly lucrative for the Middle East’s petrostates. Qatar’s energy-export earnings jumped from $87 billion to <a href="https://www.mees.com/2023/2/10/economics-finance/qatar-revenues-soar-on-record-lng-prices/ecda7c80-a952-11ed-90c3-1dcd03eed829">$132 billion</a> in 2022, while Kuwait’s increased from $63 billion to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/OPEC_Revenues_Fact_Sheet">$98 billion</a>, allowing both countries to pay a levy of $2 billion each. Norway, having nearly tripled its export earnings from $48 billion to <a href="https://www.ogv.energy/news-item/norway-under-fire-for-making-record-billions-from-gas-and-oil-revenues">$140 billion</a>, could easily afford a $5 billion levy. </p>
<p data-line-id="e033aa653aae463d92c64ee9bc61b35d"> But the largest contribution should come from Saudi Arabia, whose oil-export revenues skyrocketed to $311 billion in 2022 – a staggering $120 billion increase from the previous year. A $9 billion contribution would be less than what the Saudis spend annually on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-sports-spending-billions-soccer-golf-formula-one-2023-9">football (soccer) and golf</a>, and less than half of what they were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/saudi-arabia-wealth-fund-explored-bid-to-buy-f1-motor-racing">reportedly willing</a> to pay to acquire Formula One. </p>
<p data-line-id="4159ef5c65ef45d2bf29c4ee9d9bfa68"> Moreover, a levy on windfall revenues from fossil fuels could incentivize all developed countries to contribute. The principle of fair burden-sharing is simple: those countries and industries that have historically contributed the most to GHG emissions and enjoy the highest per capita incomes should bear a larger share of the costs. </p>
<p data-line-id="0bc201241ede4ab18c3581751085da78"> A portion of the $25 billion levy should be directly allocated to the Loss and Damage Fund. The rest should serve as paid-in capital for a new climate-financing facility aimed at supporting the Global South. This capital, in turn, would be supplemented with multi-billion-dollar guarantees from the world’s largest emitters. MDBs could then leverage these funds and potentially quadruple the resources available to low- and middle-income countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="f5e1ace24dab4a08b24316ec2f55d62c"> This strategic use of guarantees has been endorsed by several international bodies and highlighted in three recent <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/The_Triple_Agenda_G20-IEG_Report_Volume1_2023.pdf">reports to the G20</a>, including those authored by economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/n-k-singh">N.K. Singh</a> and former US Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/lawrence-h-summers">Lawrence H. Summers</a>. Adopting the Singh-Summers proposal to <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/world-bank-mdbs-how-to-triple-funding-and-make-more-effective-by-lawrence-h-summers-and-n-k-singh-2023-07">triple</a> the World Bank’s annual spending to $390 billion, along with Barbadian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/mia-amor-mottley">Mia Amor Mottley</a>’s initiative to direct <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/04/press-release-with-clock-ticking-for-the-sdgs-un-chief-and-barbados-prime-minister-call-for-urgent-action-to-transform-broken-global-financial-system/">$100 billion</a> in international funding to the Global South, would represent a major step toward mobilizing the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/over-a-1-trillion-needed-for-developing-nations-climate-transition.html">$1 trillion</a> in annual investment required for the world’s poorest countries to accelerate their transition to a climate-resilient future and achieve their development goals. </p>

These policies reflected the eurozone’s faulty design and guaranteed chronically low investment at precisely the time massive investments were necessary to shift Europe’s aging industrial base from dirty energy, chemicals, and the internal combustion engine to <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/underinvestment-in-cloud-capital-hurts-european-cars-and-energy-by-yanis-varoufakis-2023-01">cloud capital and green technologies</a>. </p><p data-line-id="c790ca2bb7be4d88bb23fb40fe83d4b6"> On both sides of the Atlantic, the policy response to the chain reaction triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was similar. The United States and the EU carried out history’s grandest and most cynical transfer of private losses from the books of quasi-criminal financiers onto public debt ledgers, combined with fiscal austerity to rein in burgeoning public debt. The result? A massive liquidity trap that increased public debt and led to the greatest disconnect ever between available liquidity and real capital investment. </p>

<p data-line-id="fcf5d99fc2c64035a114cab7543972fb"> RAMALLAH – For some people, the bloody war in Gaza may have shattered the 35-year-old consensus that the only feasible solution to the region’s troubles is to have two states, Israel and Palestine, living peaceably side by side. Yet others suggest that the horrors we have witnessed since October 7 could augur the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/israel-gaza-two-state-solution-still-the-only-alternative-to-endless-war-by-carl-bildt-2023-11">revival</a> of that very goal.  </p><p data-line-id="37d00acd32b54ef1a1e2dfa5fa9f86e0"> In recent statements, <a href="https://newsroom.ap.org/editorial-photos-videos/detail?itemid=40063eff269349c4b5ed94e459a1b978">American</a>, <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/138511">Palestinian</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/arab-ministers-urge-israel-to-resume-talks-on-two-state-solution">Arab</a> officials have all stressed that a two-state solution must emerge phoenix-like from the ashes of this war. Reasonable people everywhere can only hope that this might still provide the framework for a definitive and mutually agreed end to a century-old struggle. </p><p data-line-id="34afd885e7d344f687aef747db5c5477"> The timing of this renewed interest is ironic. November is when Palestinians commemorate the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) 1988 “<a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178680/">Declaration of Independence</a>,” which was adopted from exile in Algeria at the height of the first <em>intifada</em>. All Palestinian factions – including the most radical of the period – accepted the partition of Palestine and Israel’s de facto existence within its pre-1967 borders. </p>

We have been struggling with the consequences of automation at least since watermills and windmills spread across medieval Europe. Contrary to today’s conventional wisdom, new technology does not necessarily bring shared prosperity. Countervailing powers are always needed to press for higher wages and better working (and living) conditions. With highly capable AI coming at us unbelievably fast, <em>Power and Progress</em> offers a way to understand the technology’s likely impact – and how we can steer progress onto a more positive and inclusive path.”<br/></p>

While these approaches are broken, they are not beyond repair. In <em>Permacrisis: A Plan to Fix a Fractured World</em>, we offer an explanation of where we’ve gone wrong and put forward a provocative, inspiring plan to change the world for the better. We set out how the world can prevent crises and better manage the future, for the benefit of the many and not the few. This is our answer to the question of what change should look like.”</p>

<p data-line-id="51aff6ceb55441f2925a5a20e75bd2ad"> Cochrane says: “<em>The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level </em>explores a new view of the fundamental determinant of inflation: The price level adjusts so that the real value of government debt equals the present value of primary surpluses. In the book, I develop the theory, I integrate it with central banks that set interest-rate targets, and I place it in the framework of standard dynamic economic models. I also consider broad issues of monetary doctrine and how to analyze events. Throughout, the emphasis is on making fiscal theory <em>useful</em>, to academic researchers, to central-bank modelers, and to those making and thinking about monetary and fiscal policy.”</p>

'Why does it make unrealistic assumptions about behavior?’ – and instead focus on the discipline's actual weaknesses. I highlight a number of those weaknesses in the book, such as a lack of diversity in the profession and a particularly serious failing as a social science. Economics suffers from the positivist claim that the discipline deals only with objective facts, even though economists are always advising about ‘good’ and ‘bad’ courses of action, and thus implicitly making value judgements. And the workhorse models economists use to assess policy decisions still do not reflect the characteristics of the digital economy, such as the fact that data (unlike, say, grain) are not depleted when one person consumes it.”<a data-line-id="b17ab10a0a134dcfa33393eeffe9e3c0" href="/columnist/kevin-rudd" title="Kevin Rudd"></a></p>

Whereas the tyrants of the twentieth century ruled through violence, fear, and ideology, most modern autocrats control their citizens by distorting information and simulating democratic procedures. Like spin doctors in democracies, they distort facts to win support. Beyond showing how such dictators emerge and operate, we examine the unique threats they pose and offer recommendations about how democracies should respond.” </p>

The global echoes of that narrative can be seen in predictions of an ‘Indian century.’ But look beyond the hype, and you see hundreds of millions of Indians who are struggling to find gainful employment, have access only to poor education and health care, and are continually exposed to polluted air and water. You see women facing endemic violence in their homes and in public spaces, agriculture in distress, harsh urban living conditions, and a coercive judicial system for all but the most privileged. Dying rivers and a marauding climate crisis are further damaging lives and livelihoods. <em>India is Broken</em> is my effort to tell the post-independence history of eroding social norms and public accountability, which leave the country and its people at a dangerous impasse.”<a data-line-id="a3c32fed0c294cd1a72914955c9befdc" href="/columnist/nina-l-khrushcheva" title="Nina L.

Hong Kong was promised that it would be able to maintain its way of life, based on the rule of law and including all the freedoms of an open society, until 2047. We did what we could, in the face of Chinese threats and bullying, to lay the foundations for this promise to be kept. But, as I explain in the book, the nature of Chinese communism meant that we could not be certain whether we had succeeded.”<a data-line-id="3b38efb91f33486da0a457c73e2624e3" href="/columnist/eswar-prasad" title="Eswar Prasad"></a></p>

<p data-line-id="b50817192fca44b09000e24f4c4afd31">Rajan says: “In August 2005, I pointed to the perverse incentives for private players to take risks in a low interest-rate environment. It was no comfort to me when these risks materialized in the 2008 global financial crisis. But as central banks pursued yet more accommodative – and even unorthodox – policies to revive ailing economies, I worried that we were ignoring a primary cause of the crisis: central banks. They intervened merrily in a variety of markets, supporting prices and sometimes market players. They occasionally tied monetary-policy actions to market movements and sentiments. Somewhat perversely, the more the central bank did, the more it was expected to do, and the more it ended up doing. For instance, the mini banking crisis in March 2023 was alleviated by massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve and Treasury, including the effective insurance of all uninsured deposits, but this no longer seems to register as an aberration in the public consciousness. My central argument in this book is that monetary adventurism is rarely as much of a panacea as we think and often has unintended effects, which require yet more adventurism to address. The book is a plea to central bankers again to become more conservative and boring, and not to assume that they have all the solutions.”</p>

America’s fixation on its trade deficit with China and China’s failed pro-consumption rebalancing strategy are leading cases in point. Amplified by information distortion (America) and state-sponsored censorship (China), I warn that this confluence of false narratives has become the high-octane fuel of conflict escalation that could be ignited by any number of sparks, not least tensions over Taiwan. To avoid a catastrophic clash between the leading and rising power, I conclude with a plan for conflict resolution, featuring a market-opening Bilateral Investment Treaty and a new architecture of engagement centered around a detailed proposal for a US-China secretariat.” <br/></p>

<p data-line-id="65ee75caf786415f87adb02442563a2e"> NEW YORK – Knowledge of the basic chemical process to make iron is older than the periodic table: iron ore + coal = iron + carbon dioxide. That last part – CO<sub>2</sub> – has put the iron and steel industry under the spotlight for its contribution to climate change. Steel (an <a href="https://worldsteel.org/about-steel/about-steel/#:~:text=Steel%20is%20an%20alloy%20of,important%20engineering%20and%20construction%20material.">iron-carbon alloy</a>) alone accounts for some <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/emissions-measurement-and-data-collection-for-a-net-zero-steel-industry/executive-summary">8%</a> of annual global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and well over 10% if one includes the industry’s emissions from electricity generation and <a href="https://ember-climate.org/press-releases/coal-mine-methane-adds-27-to-steels-climate-footprint/">coal mining</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="dec155250c674d2d88e7f5414d22952e"> Fortunately, it is both technically possible and economically feasible to <a href="http://netzerosteel.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/net_zero_steel_report.pdf">eliminate</a> almost all the CO<sub>2</sub> from iron- and steel-making by mid-century. Getting there, however, will require a targeted policy push. </p>
<p data-line-id="da5f5da7e37e409b816b7d1a3c6dfdf4"> The key is first to identify the primary source of emissions. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629622000706">Over 80%</a> result from the initial step: digging up iron ore, which is largely made up of iron and oxygen, and chemically separating the oxygen. The main ingredient used to achieve this “reduction” is coal, which of course generates massive amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>. At this point, turning iron into steel becomes a comparatively low-carbon process. </p>
<p data-line-id="b0257e1f2517486791faf45b8bb96f3c"> One way to cut the industry’s emissions, then, is to avoid that first step altogether by recycling more iron and steel products than we currently do. While the iron and steel recycling rate hovers around <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2022/mcs2022-iron-steel-scrap.pdf">80-90% in the United States</a>, and over <a href="https://cssbi.ca/mid-rise-construction/sustainable-steel">80% globally</a>, the fact remains that steel is <a href="https://www.steel.org/sustainability/#:~:text=Steel%20is%20100%20percent%20recyclable,steel%2C%20you%20are%20buying%20recycled.">100% recyclable</a>. To recycle all of it means pushing designers to make products that are easier to disassemble, to more easily remove copper wiring and other contaminants. </p>
<p data-line-id="a34eece9ac7140ad95139390517261af"> Another important factor is basic material efficiency: using less steel in the first place, with architects and structural engineers minimizing its use in their designs. Governments, the largest buyer of infrastructure, have an obvious role to play here. But so, too, do the architecture and engineering professions, as well as car manufacturers. </p>
<p data-line-id="3a5af42b780a4f9e86ca49772aa78ada"> Steel could become the poster child of the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/circulareconomy/what-circular-economy">circular economy</a>, but only if governments introduce policies targeting each step in the steel supply chain. Recycling and material efficiency both add physical, logistical, and managerial complexities, which implies that industries will not adopt them automatically, even if they ultimately <a href="https://gwagner.com/science-costless/">reduce costs</a>. That means improving building and vehicle manufacturing codes (while being mindful of larger trade-offs with other materials, including glass, cement, and metals like aluminum), and compelling steel consumers to recycle all scrap. </p>
<p data-line-id="b1def18fdd0a4a3095f52809c19d9954"> Decarbonizing the next generation of iron and steel plants will require a different kind of government push to enable large new capital investments. This is no small task. We must replace the blast furnace of yore and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/basic-oxygen-furnace">basic oxygen furnace</a> as the workhorses of iron and steel production. </p>
<p data-line-id="cfb9bb67d32e4170a0cfd0366658d951"> When it comes to turning iron into steel, electric arc furnaces are an effective solution, and now account for <a href="https://rmi.org/forging-a-clean-steel-economy-in-the-united-states/">over 70%</a> of steel production in the US, up from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301420701000095">15%</a> in 1970 and just under 50% in 2000. To replace blast furnaces that use coal, there are currently two options: furnaces that rely on low-carbon hydrogen to strip oxygen from iron ore; and novel electrochemical processes that can do so with electricity. </p>
<p data-line-id="a9196375ba244ec2add9992399f7627d"> Variations of the hydrogen-based option (first developed in the 1970s) currently account for 5% of global steel production, but they are currently still <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/is-carbon-capture-too-expensive">more expensive</a> than traditional blast furnaces. The added costs amount to around $200-300 per ton of avoided CO<sub>2</sub>, which is 2-3 times the prevailing <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/carbon">carbon price</a> in Europe, and significantly higher than carbon prices almost <a href="https://www.gro-intelligence.com/carbon-barometer">anywhere else</a>. Though such prices may well be justified from a climate perspective, it will take policy interventions to bring markets along. </p>
<p data-line-id="8ab7c580e8f145bcb13f81d3f9402795"> But while steel decarbonization would benefit from sustained high carbon prices, what it really needs is a policy strategy that is both larger and more focused. The immediate task is to get the first wave of near-zero-emissions plants built so that they can become the new standard. </p>
<p data-line-id="29c2d05caf8c48129c5403ea675d96a8"> The world’s <a href="https://www.sms-group.com/en-cz/plants/projects/h2-green-steel#:~:text=Based%20near%20Boden%2C%20in%20northern,per%20ton%20of%20steel%20produced.">first full-size, clean-hydrogen steel plant</a> is being built by H2 Green Steel in Boden, just south of the Arctic Circle in Sweden, which has near-perfect policy conditions for it. Not only are Sweden’s energy and steel sectors covered by the European Union’s emissions-trading system; but, thanks to large, legacy hydropower plants and new wind farms, northern Scandinavia has abundant low-carbon electricity. It is also cheap, allowing for a long-term power purchase agreement with Norwegian Statkraft to supply power at <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060822-swedens-h2-green-steel-signs-14-twh-ppa-to-power-planned-electrolyzer">below $0.03 per kilowatt-hour</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="34ef13dc30164319ac9806c3ab56d664"> Electricity prices of below $0.03, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222006496">feasible</a> with most electricity coming from wind and (especially) solar, would allow the Colorado-based start-up Electra to break even with its electrochemical approach to traditional iron production. The company is currently funded with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-10-06/electra-raises-85m-to-electrify-and-decarbonize-iron-and-steelmaking-with-no-green-premium">$85 million</a> from venture capitalists, who are willing to bear more risks than average investors. </p>
<p data-line-id="14b2d6b7e0ab4413a5a2117bb76fa22b"> Policymakers can and must step in to help technologies like H2 Green Steel’s and Electra’s get off the ground. They should go beyond basic economy-wide climate policies to focus on providing low-cost, low-carbon electricity, and on driving down capital costs for new technologies. The US Inflation Reduction Act <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy">helps accomplish</a> the former; but it, too, falls short of supporting revolutionary iron-making technologies directly. If anything, it could hurt, as it <a href="https://gwagner.com/45v">subsidizes</a> hydrogen research and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/epa-rule-on-carbon-capture-storage-could-extend-life-of-coal-gas-by-gernot-wagner-2023-08">carbon capture</a> instead of low-emissions iron and steel-making more broadly. Once private finance becomes familiar with the new technologies, the extra costs will be manageable. But first-of-their-kind projects are inherently risky and need support. To that end, a production tax credit specifically for low-emissions iron would go a long way. </p>
<p data-line-id="d1249ffc517347049bc3109858551b8c"> Time is of the essence. Asia’s large fleet of high-carbon legacy blast furnaces account for <a href="http://netzerosteel.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/net_zero_steel_report.pdf">75% of global iron production</a>, and are due for costly relining maintenance in the decade starting in 2025. Since relining costs as much as 80% of building a blast furnace from scratch, there is a big opportunity to invest in newer, better technologies. Europe and America can help with the EU <a href="https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a> and US Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, respectively. But, to demonstrate the new technologies’ worth, governments need to provide more, and more direct, investments in them – and soon. </p>

<p data-line-id="991a0125ef5e4cf89213493ff0d4caa2"> NEW HAVEN – Last month, the economics community rejoiced when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/">awarded</a> the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences to Claudia Goldin for “having advanced our understanding of women’s labor market outcomes.”<em> </em>One can hardly think of a more deserving recipient than the scholar who pioneered the study of women in the labor force, pursued it with passion, and mentored dozens of today’s top thinkers along the way. </p><p data-line-id="6d4ab346994547b1beb21a0cffcff749"> But the significance of this year’s prize goes beyond Goldin, because it represents a long-overdue acknowledgment that the economic experience of roughly 50% of the world’s population is worthy of scientific inquiry. What may be obvious today was not always so. Until nearly a decade ago, economics professors would routinely discourage their graduate students from studying gender-related issues. Unsurprisingly, the students most interested in such topics were the few women attending graduate programs in economics at the time. “This is a very interesting question,” academic advisers would say. “But you’d better have tenure before you pursue it.” </p><p data-line-id="9526e5794af444bd97cb53c823c45a39"> It is testament to Goldin’s drive and intellect that she pursued her research agenda successfully despite such an unsupportive environment. Her efforts paved the way for the flourishing of gender-related research today. But the implications of the recognition she has received also goes well beyond gender, which is just one of many dimensions of personal “identity.” </p>

<p data-line-id="94638440af3b4363a5dbafeec6fdd160"> BRATISLAVA – The results of the recent elections in Poland and Slovakia underscore the two countries’ diverging political trajectories.

While Polish President Andrzej Duda gave PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67339017">first shot</a> at forming a government, the opposition parties have already <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67381267">announced</a> a coalition deal. </p><p data-line-id="4d839b50c8d54f318e41ac9bdd0c2fc1"> Meanwhile, in Slovakia, the left-populist party Smer-Social Democracy, led by former Prime Minister Robert Fico, eked out a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/slovakias-fico-appointed-prime-minister-fourth-time-2023-10-25/#:~:text=Oct%2025%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Leftist,and%20criticising%20sanctions%20on%20Russia.">narrow victory</a>, setting the stage for a possible return to kleptocratic rule. </p><p data-line-id="e7cd588837d7416aaca5e789c1148171"> Both elections generated record-high turnout.

<p data-line-id="bbdeec1df80c4936a81aea794b88f538"> NEW YORK – This week will witness either a historic achievement in creating a more equitable global economy or a terrible failure. A vote at the United Nations will decide whether the future of global decision-making on taxation will emerge from the negotiation of a genuinely inclusive framework convention, or if a group of rich countries will successfully insist on maintaining the current ineffective and exclusionary arrangements. </p><p data-line-id="986548fcf8d9434e8dbccb7602873d74"> The importance of Wednesday’s vote reflects the urgency of addressing the unfairness and inefficiency of the current system of corporate and wealth taxation. It is also a clarion call for the world to use multilateral principles to reach multilateral solutions. Success would demonstrate that the world can forge a different and better multilateralism – truly inclusive but also able to deliver fundamental reforms. </p><p data-line-id="1b3508a7a0f9491fa2a7b6dbfaeea693"> Almost a decade of multilateral negotiations on a global tax treaty at the OECD has yielded insufficient progress. The process has generated innovative ideas and a technical foundation on which to build a global tax system, but the type of solutions that the world needs remain far off. Independent research shows that the proposed treaty’s two “pillars” would generate far less than the OECD had projected. </p>

<p data-line-id="9d108c59e62549d7b2a1003d40fcf550"> TOKYO – At their recent summit in San Francisco, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping made progress in a few key areas. Notably, they agreed to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67411191">resume</a> direct military-to-military communications – which China had suspended last year, following a visit by then-Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan – in order to reduce the chances of accidental conflict. But neither leader was negotiating from a particularly strong position: as Biden struggles with low <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-falls-lowest-level-since-april-reutersipsos-2023-11-07/">approval ratings</a>, Xi is overseeing a rapidly <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/07/china-economy-xi-downturn-growth-instability-security-ccp/">weakening economy</a>. </p><p data-line-id="581e1f558c3d450d85e5bd4a1769f547"> The economic news out of China has been poor for some time. Growth is slowing; the population is declining; the property sector is facing huge losses; banks are grappling with <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/China-debt-crunch/China-s-top-banks-report-rising-bad-loans-as-property-woes-spread">non-performing loans</a>; and foreign investment is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-first-deficit-foreign-investment-signals-wests-de-risking-pressure-2023-11-06/">falling</a>. Each of these developments has its own cause and cure, but together, they paint a grim picture – so grim, in fact, that some now wonder whether China is facing a long period of stagnation similar to the one from which Japan has only recently emerged. </p><p data-line-id="c8ede2145318429d851d1e8346661c28"> Like China, Japan benefited from a prolonged period of robust economic performance – GDP growth in the 1950s and 1960s averaged 9-10% – before slowing to <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538244/the-japanese-economy/">5-6%</a> growth in the 1970s and 1980s. This is not hard to explain. As incomes per capita catch up to those in advanced economies, the increase in per capita income becomes more difficult to sustain, and GDP growth slows. This pattern – known as “<a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/full/10.1162/ADEV_a_00079">growth convergence</a>” – can also be observed in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. </p>

<p data-line-id="ba9a2a81b6ac4e15bcbb17ce797f7d3a"> GENEVA – The negotiators and activists preparing to attend the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai are grimly aware that there is no realistic chance of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But what has become an open secret in climate circles must be shared more widely. Paradoxically, it may be the only way to muster the political will needed to eschew incrementalism in favor of disruptive action that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge. </p>
<p data-line-id="3c3fe4adb7944585954840cc8be0cecc"> The official view remains that the 1.5°C target set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement is still achievable, but only if we act decisively and immediately. While that may be true in theory, the necessary reforms are politically painful and therefore almost non-existent. Global coal consumption, for example, climbed to a new all-time high of <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-coal-demand-set-to-remain-at-record-levels-in-2023">8.3 billion tons</a> in 2022. Moreover, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f25f315f-2551-4517-a7a2-2d9418001756">Chevron</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60295c70-a6a8-4e72-8597-4ce75d5b7c40">ExxonMobil</a> recently invested a combined $113 billion in securing additional oil and gas reserves – an unambiguous bet on the long-term profitability of fossil fuels. </p>
<p data-line-id="92ab5d810d6644f9b219e07b03c0844f"> It has become starkly apparent that we are barreling toward global temperatures at least 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This aligns with the International Energy Agency’s <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/the-energy-world-is-set-to-change-significantly-by-2030-based-on-today-s-policy-settings-alone">recent conclusion</a> that, based on today’s policies, global emissions could push up average temperatures by around 2.4°C this century. </p>
<p data-line-id="1042bbe8266343d3919a75cbf89d6028"> A future beyond 1.5°C will look very different from our current reality, and <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20230322-every-tenth-of-a-degree-matters-un-climate-report-is-a-call-for-action-not-despair">every tenth of a degree</a> will have major consequences. At 2°C warming, it is estimated that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aab827/meta">around 40%</a> of the world’s population will be exposed to severe heatwaves, while up to one-third will <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4/">experience</a> chronic water scarcity. The human cost, in terms of displacement, lost livelihoods, and early deaths, will be unprecedented, with vulnerable communities, largely in poorer countries, bearing the heaviest burden. </p>
<p data-line-id="97bbe13f69b34d8b9495dc0cc81a28b3"> We must do everything within our power to prevent these outcomes. But, ironically, raising false hopes of achieving the 1.5°C target has become a roadblock to progress on climate action. As NatureFinance highlights in a publication released on the eve of COP28, “<a href="https://www.naturefinance.net/resources-tools/future-beyond-1-5-degrees/">Time to Plan for a Future Beyond 1.5 Degrees</a>,” this goal reflects our ambition but, perversely, has embedded the fiction of a “win-win” energy transition, whereby the future world looks much like ours, only without carbon emissions. This narrative, promoted by many political, business, and civil-society leaders, constrains our response, forcing us to act within the confines of conventional wisdom. </p>
<p data-line-id="f22cef720f874e2796be98cac0b61ec4"> Humans struggle to react to slow-moving crises. Escaping this pattern usually requires a “new truth” to become self-evident, often through a sudden jolt that cements a paradigm shift and broadens the realm of possibility. </p>
<p data-line-id="5cb2cf064bf5428f80304a30c22f74f7"> In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, finance ministers and central bank governors abandoned the long-held belief that monetary expansion must be avoided at all costs for fear of inflation; instead, they embraced quantitative easing – in effect, printing money – to stimulate recovery. Similarly, after the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, leading G20 governments renounced their commitment to fiscal probity and adopted costly universal-income payments previously derided as utopian fantasy. </p>
<p data-line-id="b5144c569445471cbb4f1611b8a7221e"> Pivoting to a “beyond 1.5°C” narrative could provide the jolt necessary to reject a business-as-usual mindset in favor of interventions that break from accepted norms and disrupt the status quo. Consider, for example, the existential issue of food security. Helping vulnerable smallholder farmers shift to regenerative practices might work in a world where warming is limited to 1.5°C. But it could hinder their pivot away from farming methods and livelihoods that will no longer exist if temperatures exceed that target. </p>
<p data-line-id="cbc75e7ebbe740498230a978c0b99240"> At the same time, global food supply chains may become less important beyond 1.5°C of warming, as producing countries restrict exports and major sovereign importers like China focus on achieving self-sufficiency. Such on-shoring is likely to accelerate investment in capital-intensive food production that is more climate-resilient and less nature-dependent, including vertical farming and lab-grown proteins. Judging by the rollout of renewable-energy technologies, the main challenge may be deploying these resilient food systems at scale in poorer countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="549e03def43843f6bdfffe8a283c7130"> The finance sector is also ripe for disruption. Investments must urgently be steered away from carbon-intensive assets. Yet ongoing efforts to factor climate-related risks into asset valuation and allocation have obviously failed. Much bolder action is needed to align financial flows with national and international climate policies and commitments. Central banks and supervisors, for example, must move beyond financial risk and discard their cherished policy independence, which they have previously done in times of crisis. Under such circumstances, regulators could align with national net-zero policy goals and international commitments in imposing mandatory requirements on financial institutions to deliver net-zero, nature-positive portfolios within a certain timeframe.  </p>
<p data-line-id="94f579f579ce4ed5aa02a74fcd8643c4"> Realism about the 1.5°C target is necessary to abandon incremental efforts and begin thinking bigger. Truly innovative climate action is impossible without letting go of this much-hoped-for goal and the comforting vision of an illusory future that accompanied it. While such a pivot would not guarantee success, it could unlock unconventional measures to limit rising temperatures and prepare for a warmer world. </p>

<p data-line-id="a73398535abb4e8f92b8f09d25a23e26"> LONDON – The world was a relatively peaceful place during the nineteenth century. Aside from the American Civil War and China’s Taiping Rebellion, there were few prolonged conflicts anywhere between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. This raises a fundamental question: How did Europe largely avoid major wars for 100 years amid what Hedley Bull called “<a href="http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/ps240/03%20Anarchy,%20Hierarchy,%20and%20Sovereignty/Bull%20-%20The%20Anarchical%20Society%20(Ch%201-3).pdf">international anarchy</a>”? </p><p data-line-id="33d0adc0e3d54a0fbbfbb1f623d84b65"> The prevailing view is that the <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-concert-of-europe/#:~:text=The%20Concert%20of%20Europe%2C%20also,World%20War%20I%20in%201914.">Concert of Europe</a>, established in 1815, played a key role in preserving the peace. Although frequently perceived as a mechanism for maintaining the continent’s balance of power, the Concert actually served a normative purpose: preventing war between countries with shared interests and values. </p><p data-line-id="168b218f4cce4fbaa87a84d78f575484"> Essentially, the five major European powers – Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, and Russia – agreed not to alter their borders without mutual consent. The establishment of spheres of influence, serving as physical buffers between these great powers, was integral to their geopolitical calculations. </p>

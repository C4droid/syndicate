<p data-line-id="60bba4dbe62544f48345731ff5c07ab2"> OXFORD – As the world grapples with the implications of ominous shifts within China, MIT economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/yasheng-huang">Yasheng Huang</a>, an astute long-term observer of the Chinese economy, has produced a well-timed book. In <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300266368/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-east/"><em>The Rise and Fall of the EAST: How Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology Brought China Success, and Why They Might Lead to Its Decline</em></a><em>,</em> he combines a close examination of contemporary China with an ambitious (sometimes overly so) assessment of the country’s recent and distant past. </p>
<p data-line-id="c1f58f88c54f48179f375d3922fbbd4f"> Like Huang’s other writings, <em>The Rise and Fall of the EAST</em> has a crisp, punchy, and occasionally satirical tone. Unflinching in his criticism of the current Chinese regime’s failings, Huang champions China’s great reformers, including politically fallen ones. </p>
<p data-line-id="658ecb9c346c493cb512de891607b21a"> Given the current political climate in China, it is a courageous book. Huang shows, with great conviction, that China owes its economic miracle to its embrace of market forces and the private sector, which formed the core of the “reform and opening-up” that began four decades ago, following the death of Mao Zedong. By retreating from those earlier policies and commitments, Chinese leaders created the conditions for the setbacks and stagnation that we are seeing today. </p>
<p data-line-id="a07a2bd36de540b490f029939b936446"> Building on the title’s acronym, the book’s chapters unfold like an array of mirror images alternating between past and present, and between China and the West. Students of contemporary China, especially those from outside the country, will be well rewarded by the intimate and updated portrayal of the events and personalities of recent decades. </p>
<p data-line-id="06f02304ec0045588441dcf8099ae9f7"> But the book is also richly historical, with two parallel narratives: a shorter history of the last 40-70 years (thus including the pre-reform Mao era), and a longer one going back two millennia. It is through this long-term perspective that Huang unveils the causes of not just 40 years of remarkable growth, but also its recent reversal into stagnation under the current regime. As an economic historian, I applaud this grand historical narrative. Despite some pitfalls and detours, Huang brings unusual interpretative depth to the matter. </p>
<h2 data-line-id="8c61ceb48da64036847663fcab8dd5e6"><strong>What Made the Miracle?</strong></h2>
<p data-line-id="0285bd9faed8487caf0ced147ec11140"> Whether the modern Chinese miracle was driven by the market or the state remains a fundamental question. For the last decade, an ever-clearer tilt toward the latter has led to a subtle but decisive official rewriting of the ideological and political history of the last 70 years. History, for the current regime, is not about understanding the past; rather, it has become a tool to legitimize the past decade’s ideological turn back toward greater party and state control. </p>
<p data-line-id="35cac2b568fe49bcac236060bef66bb0"> Those previous four decades of reform and opening-up coincided with dazzling double-digit economic growth, leaving many to believe – with a sigh of relief or even amnesia – that the Mao era was firmly in the past. But the events of the past decade show that not everyone shared that belief. And when those with a different view include the men at the very top, the consequences for China and the world can be profound. </p>
<p data-line-id="c5a6a803740d4babb0bda1e415e403af"> Huang presents his own position unequivocally, proclaiming the market to be the ultimate driving force of China’s economic growth miracle. In his “shorter” history, he – like other staunch supporters of the market view – gives credit to the ideological and intellectual dynamism of the 1980s as the origin of China’s transformation. </p>
<p data-line-id="67c003946a364ffa9b795558024f4fd0"> By gradually “growing out of the [five-year] plan,” to use historian Barry Naughton’s <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/growing-out-of-the-plan/4500F9826731A4765F9B6C2EFCE7AD53">phrase</a>, China achieved marketization, de-collectivization, greater ideological and intellectual openness, and even political reform. The latter, though often fitful, kicked in to gear to dismantle the rigid Mao-era state controls over society and personal lives, while all the economic changes lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of abject poverty. </p>
<h2 data-line-id="d4dee2542731449d8369e3e7735ec199"><strong>Deng’s Last Stand</strong></h2>
<p data-line-id="95e6424ff1f54338b3c73957844bd054"> In recounting this history, Huang offers vivid portrayals of Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, Hu Qili, and other colorful and bold reform leaders. He shows how the 1980s, brimming with optimism, culminated in a massive nationwide plea for further liberalization. This was the cause championed by the students who gathered in Tiananmen Square and in towns and cities throughout the country in the spring of 1989. The subsequent military crackdown was China’s most severe retreat from liberalizing reform since the late 1970s. </p>

<p data-line-id="2e56bbfd0a0a4ec3a0e27d9580f6901a"> Nonetheless, the reform project was relaunched in dramatic fashion in 1992, and by the same paramount leader who had ordered the Tiananmen crackdown three years earlier. An increasingly frail, diminutive, and barely audible Deng Xiaoping undertook a whirlwind southern tour from Shenzhen – a fishing village that was being transformed into a manufacturing and export hub – to Shanghai. A dynamic, freewheeling economic powerhouse in the pre-Communist era, Shanghai had become a heartland of communist conservatism. But now, the Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership was championing radical reform measures. </p>
<p data-line-id="df2c9ff7a9ea41cdbf4c5c031c8593f8"> Deng’s last stand for reform ushered in the decades of explosive growth that propelled China to global prominence as the world’s second-largest economy. But Huang gives more credit to the 1980s than to the subsequent two decades. Somewhat downplaying the achievements of politicians such as Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and even the charismatic premier, Zhu Rongji, he views those who followed Deng as more ideologically statist. </p>
<p data-line-id="fda26932df2e4ed292f046f176afdbc5"> As someone who came of age as a college student in the 1980s, I share Huang’s nostalgia for the uplifting mood of that era. But does a mood always represent reality? </p>
<p data-line-id="ee8a7cc112334e0aad8fa1fcc9dd1b5a"> It is easy to forget just how much poorer China was in the 1980s. Back then, the average Chinese had very little cash and almost no foreign currency. Most had never traveled abroad – or even dreamed of doing so. The economy was dominated by a massive state sector. There was little to no genuine recognition of private property, even in rural areas, despite the famous Household Responsibility System, nor was there much access to foreign contacts. </p>
<p data-line-id="a13399f368dc44459c699a68ab2cd8d7"> Because the 1980s generation was starting from such a low level, they had plenty of stars to gaze at. But intellectual imagination alone does not change reality. Poverty constrains not just material well-being but also civil liberties. </p>
<p data-line-id="c89ec90cb75944e5ada6b6aea0f1d084"> Revisiting China in the mid-1990s and after, I found a country making huge strides in marketization, privatization, and openness. While it was more ideologically subdued, with few speaking openly about political reforms, there was also a quietly emerging civil society. Years of spectacular growth had swept away the lingering Mao-era constraints that had remained in the 1980s. </p>
<p data-line-id="c6dc408ab27242f19137658f4acbae12"> True, corruption also became far more rampant after the 1980s. But that is a familiar byproduct of rapid wealth creation and rising inequality. Moreover, the larger point remains: China’s unprecedented economic growth took off <em>after</em> the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. </p>
<h2 data-line-id="ad9501cf98cc4ecaa51f547007f2d526"><strong>The Long History</strong></h2>
<p data-line-id="93a2910f536641c9b38442d5cea45502"> Lest this brief critique of Huang’s “shorter” history fail to do full justice to the book, we must turn to his “longer” foray through two millennia of Chinese history. Here, he makes a truly herculean effort to explore the historical origins and continued resilience of Chinese autocracy. Projecting the full sweep of Chinese history onto contemporary events necessarily requires a highly selective account of past events and personalities, and Huang performs this task admirably. </p>
<p data-line-id="c07a3acf9f454906887b27459aa5e2f2"> Though unorthodox, the unusual historical weight that he accords to China’s two shortest dynasties, the Qin (221-206 BC) and Sui (581-618 AD), is both insightful and illustrative. The Qin were the first to unify China under a system of direct administrative rule (through a county system), and the short-lived Sui initiated the <em>Keju</em> civil-service examination system. These two institutions remain the pillars of Chinese autocracy to this day. </p>
<p data-line-id="b8bf2572df1844c1a08b3f5c14016b9a"> Huang also offers a curious analysis comparing the lives of the Ming Emperor Wanli (1563-1620) with his near-contemporary Henry VIII (1491-1547) of England. The result is a portrait of contrasts. Though Wanli was one of China’s meekest emperors, he faced very few external constraints, whereas the notoriously temperamental and despotic Henry encountered many. </p>
<p data-line-id="f1efc46d73fa457fa252281a51cee237"> Such sweeping historical narratives always run the risk of succumbing to clichés. The implication is that the difference between China and the West is a matter of autocracy versus democracy, absolutism versus constraint, state versus society, centralized versus decentralized, and innovation versus conformity. Though simplistic, dichotomy helps to guide Huang’s search for patterns in China’s long history. </p>
<p data-line-id="2b470a3ea189420cb152de796530dcdc"> In one chapter, he revisits the thesis advanced by the British historian of science Joseph Needham that China was the world’s most advanced technological leader during the Medieval era. To test this claim, Huang shows how a massive database of technical innovations covering a thousand years supports his contention that periods of fragmentation and decentralization were the most innovative in Chinese history. Given that the reconstructed database was an amalgam of disparate inventions, varying definitions, and indeterminate categories, his sweeping conclusion will give readers pause – and leave some professional historians gasping for air. </p>
<h2 data-line-id="ef2b2a60d5954c34896cb522afc7f5fe"><strong>The Test of Time</strong></h2>
<p data-line-id="11be2241a2764c0086749b378c001c01"> Huang also revisits the birth and evolution of that remarkable Chinese institution, the <em>Keju</em> examination (the first letter of his EAST acronym). Although only a tiny percentage of the male population ever made it through this rigidly hierarchical system, the <em>Keju’s</em> lasting impact has been massive – politically, economically, culturally, and socially. In Huang’s brilliant and insightful telling, the system has been both a blessing and a curse since its introduction. </p>
<p data-line-id="e9f293f6fc23492a954e7a3e548bf750"> That said, Huang does make some missteps. For example, his claim that the <em>Keju</em> decayed during the Qing era is contradicted by a mountain of literature showing that it was, in fact, tuned to near perfection as an instrument of social control and political indoctrination. That is how a small ethnic minority of Manchus managed to maintain their rule. </p>
<p data-line-id="b878a673bfa74ea5abb7cc143ba0a50c"> Huang contends that the selling of <em>Keju</em> titles – or, to be more exact, positions in the hierarchy of the examined – eroded the institution under the Qing. But the sale of official titles was strictly regulated, and it became rampant only during the crisis years of the 1860s Taiping Rebellion, when some 20-30 million people were killed. As soon as the Taipings were defeated and peace restored, the practice was reined in. If anything, the fact that selling positions in the hierarchy generated such a strong backlash confirms that the <em>Keju</em> was still held in high regard. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--branding newsletter--ps newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-label="Sign up for our weekly On Point newsletter" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-onpoint-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="88f955e866f84919bad3af76a694c5ba"> Even stranger is Huang’s claim that Qing rulers were less enamored with the <em>Keju</em> because Han Chinese (particularly from southern provinces) outcompeted Manchus. In reality, the Manchus already had a favorable ethnic quota and never had to contend with the vast, hapless majority of Han Chinese. (When the Qing fell in 1911, it was partly because of those Manchu privileges.) </p>
<p data-line-id="61fe88ecb73542a4ba04b6629b664aa7"> For Huang, the <em>Keju </em>system represents a common thread tying the ancient to the modern. According to the landmark “tournament theory,” local and regional governments promoted economic growth during the modern reform era because the central government had used criteria such as GDP performance or other quantifiable political, economic, and social indicators to evaluate and incentivize regional bureaucrats. Huang sees the <em>Keju</em> exam as the historical equivalent to such indicators. </p>
<p data-line-id="c7379ccf947b4ed6b808a977661a1e3f"> But this approach is conceptually confusing, because the <em>Keju</em> was not an indicator of bureaucratic performance but rather a screening device to supply rulers with bureaucrats from a pool of successful candidates. True, rulers did develop other criteria, such as the eighteenth-century classification of counties by their relative geographic importance, difficulties with administration, taxation, and degree of public order. But these measures show that imperial rulers’ overriding concern was with political stability; the idea of GDP or GDP growth would have meant nothing to them. </p>
<h2 data-line-id="2b07c35f1ccd40adbd87387d7f6d4116"><strong>The Uses of History</strong></h2>
<p data-line-id="61c64d1725f04058806cbd325c46c0ce"> Huang’s book is the latest installment in a broader trend: China scholars are increasingly turning to history to develop a more enduring understanding of China’s place in the world. But when one’s emphasis is on historical origins and the persistence of institutions, one must be mindful of the need to avoid historical determinism. History is highly mutable, and the past will always be open to multiple interpretations. And interpretations themselves reshape the past and present. More importantly, change and transformation cannot be interpreted by examining events within China alone. </p>
<p data-line-id="5ee31783be77409eb4a9a7e284fefe44"> China had been at a crossroads before, not least during the second half of the nineteenth century, when Western imperial powers oversaw an earlier, forcible “opening-up.” Spurred by the gradual but profound recognition of its own backwardness, China moved toward constitutional monarchy in the 1898 Hundred Days’ Reform and the 1901-11 late-Qing Constitutional Reforms. Then, after 1911, the fall of the Qing ushered in a short-lived experiment with parliamentary politics in the Republican era. </p>
<p data-line-id="48b89a1629304a4da8c971d47087589b"> Why did those experiments fail? More importantly, how did communism – a term few people had heard of in the 1920s – become the dominant ideology by the late 1940s? While much of this history still needs to be assessed and reassessed, it is clear that such profound ideological and political changes must be understood in the context of the rise of Meiji Japan and Bolshevik Russia. </p>
<p data-line-id="ad06e72b9bcf41bfa5b8074d41153fdc"> The same goes for the 1980s, which Huang describes with such warmth and nostalgia. China’s ideological shift must be understood as a response to the rapid economic growth of its defeated rivals: Japan in World War II, South Korea in the Korean War, Taiwan in China’s Civil War, and the still-colonized (or humiliated) territory of Hong Kong. Add Singapore’s newfound prosperity under Lee Kuan Yew, and there was more than enough evidence to shock the Chinese psyche. After 30 years of isolation, China had fallen woefully behind again. </p>
<p data-line-id="d01a7967c7ed45cc85c1c23e754e56cc"> I well remember the gloom that hung over China in the summer of 1989, immediately following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. It stood in stark contrast to the euphoria in the former Soviet republics and Eastern and Central Europe following the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. There was a widespread sense that authoritarianism was bound to fail, and democracy certain to win. The end of history was nigh. </p>
<p data-line-id="d21a8e9f71f14c47a764f52e80a3fbff"> But now, China’s remarkable economic transformation and the lasting legacy of “shock therapy” in Russia and Eastern Europe seem to have cast doubt on those earlier triumphalist assumptions. Similarly, for all the euphoria that surrounded the Arab Spring, those popular uprisings soon gave way to renewed authoritarianism. Indeed, that was just when China was beginning its own return to greater state and party control. </p>
<p data-line-id="79a47cc203f74414840806bf93ba79e0"> While I do not subscribe to a single view on the merits of authoritarianism or democracy as an engine of economic growth, I agree with Huang that China owes its 40 years of unprecedented growth to markets, not the state. Meanwhile, we in the West owe it to ourselves to gain a better understanding of what really happened in China and what underlies sustainable progress before exporting our ideological conviction. </p>

<p data-line-id="8747dc6c827e428c934a3a117f017e41"> GENEVA – Among the most shocking images from the COVID-19 pandemic were of people gasping for air, unable to breathe, their blood oxygen so severely depleted that some died in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/14/patients-are-dying-from-being-stuck-in-ambulances-outside-ae-report">ambulances</a> lined up outside hospitals. In wealthier countries, there was a panicked rush to expand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html">ventilator capacity</a> to deal with the surge of people experiencing acute respiratory distress. In countries like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-desperate-hospitals-scramble-to-find-more-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82593662.cms">India</a> and <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/kenyans-suffer-as-hospitals-face-acute-oxygen-shortage/2213914">Kenya</a>, there was an even more desperate scramble to find oxygen cylinders for loved ones. In low- and middle-income countries, <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/25-5-2023-global-oxygen-alliance-launched-boost-access-life-saving-oxygen">nine out of ten</a> hospitals lacked the equipment to provide oxygen therapy. </p>
<p data-line-id="74f99703414f4b0c9fbf62a6fe57289b"> Seeing people dying for lack of oxygen, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Unitaid, USAID, and other global agencies took action. Under the umbrella of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, we established the Oxygen Emergency Taskforce to coordinate the emergency response, broaden access, and secure supplies. Since then, the taskforce has overseen an investment exceeding $1 billion for oxygen-related needs, primarily via the <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/covid-19/response-mechanism/">Global Fund COVID-19 Response Mechanism</a> (C19RM). These funds have gone toward procuring oxygen cylinders and bulk storage tanks, installing oxygen production machines (known as pressure swing adsorption plants), and offering specialized training for health workers. </p>
<p data-line-id="768a5817fe924edc85d8722f766ae10e"> Tragically, this response came too late for too many people, because the peak of the pandemic coincided with a <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/confronting-global-oxygen-shortage-and-its-consequences">worldwide shortage</a> of oxygen cylinders. Furnishing a hospital with a sustainable oxygen supply takes many months, given the need to install sophisticated equipment and pipework; and training health workers to provide oxygen safely cannot be done overnight. </p>
<p data-line-id="43137ee936054ad2b138999e99f4162c"> Following the acute phase of the pandemic, the Oxygen Emergency Taskforce’s focus shifted toward ensuring greater access to medical oxygen on a sustainable basis, so that what happened with COVID-19 is never repeated. Moreover, there is a compelling case for expanding access to medical oxygen even without the threat of a pandemic. Lack of oxygen in low- and middle-income countries leads to <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/25-5-2023-global-oxygen-alliance-launched-boost-access-life-saving-oxygen">800,000</a> preventable deaths every year. Newborn babies die of respiratory distress syndrome. Mothers die when complications in childbirth result in hypoxemia. Acute trauma victims – from violence or traffic accidents, for example – also die from lack of oxygen. Surgical procedures for a wide range of conditions, including cancer, cannot be carried out without medical oxygen. </p>
<p data-line-id="2f4592b6ab79449f830d45c26ac9bac2"> It would be difficult to identify a better example of an investment that simultaneously reinforces pandemic preparedness and saves lives now. Research by the Every Breath Counts Coalition <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/12/e007468.full">shows</a> that hospitals that offer pediatric care with a fully functioning supply of oxygen can reduce deaths due to child pneumonia by almost half, and all children’s deaths by one-quarter. </p>
<p data-line-id="f057b761e0534fa68dbe3d2f09f72096"> To maintain the pace of progress in expanding access to medical oxygen, the Global Fund and Unitaid, alongside other partners, have transformed the Oxygen Emergency Taskforce into a <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2023/2023-05-24-global-oxygen-alliance-launched-to-boost-access-to-lifesaving-oxygen/">Global Oxygen Alliance</a>, known as GO<sub>2</sub>AL. Its objectives are to provide financial support for oxygen production and supply, comprehensive technical and training assistance, and advocacy for equitable access. </p>
<p data-line-id="f2b146a245214ad29edf0a96ca82c1b0"> National governments are also taking the lead. For example, this past April, Kenyan President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/william-ruto">William Ruto</a> and county governors set aside $41.7 million for a <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/global-fund-investment-medical-oxygen-infrastructure-launches-kenya#:~:text=NAIROBI%20%E2%80%93%20Kenyan%20President%20William%20Ruto,Health%20Africa%2C%20a%20global%20health">program</a> to distribute medical oxygen cylinders and bulk storage tanks to the country’s health-care centers. With the support of the Global Fund and other partners, Kenya also is <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/opinion/article/2001471589/kenya-can-now-dream-big-with-new-medical-oxygen-initiative">building</a> a nationwide network of oxygen-production plants, bulk-storage tanks, and cylinder distribution channels to ensure that hospitals and primary-care facilities have sufficient supplies. </p>
<p data-line-id="bbd97af6d2444ab581cb8262b8066509"> Far too many people died from lack of oxygen during the COVID-19 pandemic, and far too many are dying unnecessarily today from other conditions because medical oxygen is not routinely available. That is why we have embarked on the most ambitious effort yet to increase access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="1339d734b0894950b336275db4f0ab53"> To date, and thanks to the generosity of donors led by the United States and Germany, the Global Fund has invested <a href="https://www.theglobalfight.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231103-UHC-Report_v3-Digital.pdf">$617 million</a> to support 98 countries and six regional projects in their efforts to increase access to oxygen. Doing so will save millions of lives and significantly improve low- and middle-income countries’ ability to respond to future disease threats. </p>
<p data-line-id="f889c2dc289949d4937b53fdc912076f"> Sadly, nothing will bring back the people who died gasping for air. But owing to our unified response to COVID-19, millions of others can be spared a similar fate. </p>

<p data-line-id="58cf356ab19b4ac68262f8aad628d0a6">When 2023 began, economists and market analysts were warning of imminent recession, stagflation, and possible financial crisis. But the dire forecasts did not come to pass, and the world economy is entering 2024 on a far more hopeful note, with most major economies expected to achieve a much-desired “soft landing.”</p><p data-line-id="582b96a055df492aa036288910dccaea">But we should not put too much stock in economic forecasts, cautions former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management <strong>Jim O’Neill</strong>, owing to the “many known unknowns” at play today – especially on the geopolitical front – as well as the “many unknown unknowns lurking on the horizon.” In assessing inflation-related risks, forecasters will need to keep a close eye on factors like monetary growth, inflation expectations, and wage growth.</p><p data-line-id="62b102f7f69946d398f27930257b833e">New York University’s <strong>Nouriel Roubini</strong> agrees that the “current encouraging consensus could still be derailed by any number of factors, not least geopolitics.” While the worst-case scenarios – including a “severe recession, leading to a credit and debt crisis” – appear relatively unlikely for now, geopolitical shocks, such as “new tensions” between the United States and China, could as a drag on growth.</p><p data-line-id="890e04371d2b405fac10ca7f3956ba35">In fact, the University of Cambridge’s <strong>Mohamed A. El-Erian </strong>argues, “the chances of robust global growth in 2024 appear tenuous.” Today’s “optimistic sentiment” appears to be driven largely by expectations of “central banks aggressively cutting interest rates amid the softest of all soft landings for the US economy.” But there is good reason to think that central-bank policies alone “may not be enough to generate the necessary growth momentum to withstand the headwinds facing the global economy.”</p><p data-line-id="6b034893d24a4897b878f60de667391f">Harvard’s <strong>Kenneth Rogoff</strong> thinks that 2024 may well be a “rocky year for everyone.” The likelihood of recession in the US is still “probably around 30%, compared to 15% in normal years,” and “Chinese leaders’ significant efforts to restore 5% annual economic growth face several daunting challenges.” But it is emerging markets that are in the most danger: if “global growth fails to meet expectations,” they could “struggle” to avert a crisis.</p><p data-line-id="3063250935084e779c275f1b7f749f7d">The World Bank’s <strong>Indermit Gill</strong> and <strong>M. Ayhan Kose</strong> similarly highlight the risks of weak global growth for developing economies. If these countries are to “turn the tide,” they should “focus their policies on generating a broadly beneficial investment boom” and “avoid the kinds of fiscal policies that often derail economic progress and contribute to instability.”</p><p data-line-id="0efb480ae15b463c9c1782a1becb3f32">But Harvard’s <strong>Dani Rodrik </strong>argues that tackling the “four big challenges” the world faces – “the climate transition, the good-jobs problem, an economic-development crisis, and the search for a newer, healthier form of globalization” – will require altogether new approaches. “We must leave behind established modes of thinking and seek creative workable solutions,” he advises, “while recognizing that these efforts will be necessarily uncoordinated and experimental.”</p>

<p data-line-id="f7ca0fc14d304b0f871fe5013a50eb5d"> BANGKOK – As autocratic leaders gain influence, if not power, in more countries than proponents of democracy care to count, Myanmar is a remarkable exception: its military junta appears untenable. In fact, Myanmar’s people are putting their lives on the line to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/asia/myanmar-nationwide-offensive-junta-intl-hnk/index.html">break the generals’ grip on power</a> and reclaim their future. </p><p data-line-id="d4a8f1367c0c4479a7774ab32479b167"> After nearly a half-century of <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/myanmar-history-coup-military-rule-ethnic-conflict-rohingya">military dictatorship</a>, starting in 1962, a decade of political liberalization, economic reform, and development progress followed, lasting from 2011 until 2021. But Senior General Min Aung Hlaing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/01/myanmar-military-coup-kills-fragile-democracy">seized power</a> from Myanmar’s re-elected civilian government on February 1, 2021, triggering a civil war in which young people, ethnic-minority armies, civilian leaders, and a defiant population have been fighting the regime. More recently, resistance forces – waging what they now call a “<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/new-escalation-armed-conflict-myanmar">revolution</a>” – have scored a series of battlefield victories, turning the tide of the conflict. </p><p data-line-id="b61b68df1a2e437793ef6c9d29460c3a"> But it is one thing to defeat Myanmar’s military; it is quite another to reconstitute a viable pluralistic state with popular legitimacy in an ethnically fractious country. Moreover, Myanmar’s deadly internal conflict could drag on for months as the military makes its last stand around major cities and towns, including the capital of Nay Pyi Taw, relying on air power, armor, and artillery to survive. </p>

<p data-line-id="0ffe3d9f7b6a4d18936b7dc104c2584a"> CAMBRIDGE – Behavioral economists have popularized the term “recency bias” to describe our tendency to be disproportionately influenced by the latest events compared to earlier ones. Could this cognitive phenomenon explain why numerous analysts have a rather optimistic tilt for the world economy in 2024? Or are there really positive trends counterbalancing the obvious and mounting challenges to global growth? </p><p data-line-id="fd691a124f1e46219b52b96eed90a462"> A recent <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5c2f60e0-f043-4b71-a153-1c747b4ed982">editorial</a> reflected the prevailing optimism, proclaiming that “after this year’s resilient showing, there is every chance that the reality next year will also be better than expected.” The trends that supported the global economy’s unexpected resilience in 2023 “also offer plenty of reasons to be optimistic for 2024.” </p><p data-line-id="d543b20507c6482a88f33305de4ce6c4"> This upbeat mood has spread to financial markets. A growing number of commentators have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/23/business/wall-st-loves-to-guess-but-nobody-knows-what-the-market-will-do-in-2024.html">predicted</a> that stock markets will finish the year above the already elevated levels of 2023, which were buoyed by a remarkable year-end rally. </p>

<p data-line-id="0afd1daed85445078a2e092a1a36581a"> NEW HAVEN – On January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, US President Donald Trump, the loser of the 2020 election, famously <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial">addressed</a> a gathering of followers who then joined the mob that attacked the US Capitol. While rambling and incoherent, Trump’s speech nonetheless made a few things clear: leftists had conspired to steal the election by fraud, and the mobs summoned to Washington on his behalf would need to “stand strong.” The implication was that violence might be necessary, because “you’ll never take back your country with weakness.” </p><p data-line-id="42a682a1df87486aa3be49afd6c6c63f"> Trump then made Vice President Mike Pence the target of collective scorn for refusing to send the Electoral College process back to the states. If “weak Republicans” would not step up and participate in overturning the results, Trump vowed, “we will … never ever forget.” For the next 4-5 hours, in the most recorded event in American history, the world watched as a new “Lost Cause” was born in violence and spectacular lies. </p><p data-line-id="a4530993f97043d5bb0f38b2b9a04795"> There have been numerous Lost Causes in modern history, usually following defeats in war, where the vanquished glorify their loss as a source of pride and shared animosity toward the victors. Three big Lost Causes have plagued world and American history. Following their bloody defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the French exhibited an intergenerational cultural need to avenge the loss. Then, following Germany’s defeat in World War I, the Nazis gained traction by blaming Jews and leftists, who were depicted as “poisons” in the blood of the body politic. And then, of course, there was the American South after the Civil War, when the narrative of the Confederate Lost Cause yielded a potent brew of twisted history and white supremacist ideology. </p>

While it remains a lower-middle-income country with a per capita income under $3,000 (at market exchange rates), India’s rapid growth suggests that its economic potential may be greater than expected. </p><p data-line-id="6ada1da4d8f94a15811be3877d905bfb"> But any optimism about India’s economic prospects must be tempered by its inability to address two related challenges. The first is the unequal distribution of the benefits of rapid economic growth, which have accrued predominantly to the top 10-20% of income earners. </p><p data-line-id="d3dfe7adfdbe48f295fea10faa1f67fd"> India’s <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/indias-consumption-really-falling">failure to release</a> any consumption figures since 2011-12 has made it difficult to produce reliable estimates of potential increases in inequality and poverty. Such estimates rely heavily on consumer expenditure surveys, typically conducted every five years. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government <a href="https://thewire.in/economy/cea-nsc-consumer-spending-data">scrapped the 2017-18 survey</a> because the findings did not align with its preferred narrative. The government has refused to conduct subsequent surveys, even though up-to-date data are vital for informed policymaking. </p>

This is partly because of gender-based legal disparities, such as a lower mandatory retirement age for women and the lack of pension credit for periods of childcare. Because women have shorter working lives, earn less, and have higher life expectancy than men, they often <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/Library/Publications/2015/UNwomen-PolicyBrief03-ProtectingWomensIncomeSecurityInOldAge-en.pdf">receive lower benefits</a>, which must last longer. </p><p data-line-id="306772d57cb641d393c53fb6a87e269b"> But the problem is most acute in low- and middle-income countries.

And, as Sri Lanka’s recent restructuring has shown, the mounting <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/sovereign-debt-crisis-sri-lanka-causes-policy-response-and-prospects">sovereign-debt crisis</a> threatens to erode retirement savings further, pushing even more older women into poverty. </p><p data-line-id="5fa25ece22034e4f9175156630448694"> After <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-opts-for-pre-emptive-debt-default-to-combat-crisis/article65314691.ece">defaulting</a> on its foreign loans in early 2022, the Sri Lankan government agreed to restructure both its <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sri-lanka-government-imf-austerity-deal-will-exacerbate-debt-crisis-by-jayati-ghosh-and-kanchana-n-ruwanpura-2023-09">external and domestic debt</a>, as required by its bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="68ef50225b424718a0e3688f47647f33"> PROVIDENCE/NEW DELHI – The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai concluded with a <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era">carefully worded statement</a> calling for the phase-out of fossil fuels, raising hopes that the international community might finally meet the targets set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But achieving these carbon-reduction goals will be difficult without immediate and decisive action by India, the world’s third-largest greenhouse-gas (GHG) emitter. </p>
<p data-line-id="9fb085b3d44d4763bf76e47f5f9d96f7"> India – which accounted for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions">7.6% of global GHG emissions</a> in 2022, compared to China’s 30.7% and the United States’ 13.6% – has set ambitious renewable-energy targets and taken a leading role in international climate talks. But while these efforts suggest that India is genuinely committed to moving away from fossil fuels, the country also faces political obstacles that could severely impede its ability to achieve crucial climate goals. </p>
<p data-line-id="6dec94b0fefe42898533d80e2ca21bb7"> India has adopted a countercyclical approach to taxing petroleum-related products, reducing taxes when global prices increase and raising them when prices drop. European governments followed a more extreme strategy after gas prices spiked in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, providing subsidies of more than <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/national-policies-shield-consumers-rising-energy-prices">€650 billion</a> ($712 billion) between September 2021 and January 2023 to protect consumers from soaring energy costs. </p>
<p data-line-id="357e80f43a0c41ceac0b3dd1026ab80b"> In India, however, the effective carbon price was just <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ECR">€14 per ton in 2021</a>. Moreover, electricity in India is heavily subsidized, with many households and farmers benefiting from free power or paying only a fraction of the actual cost. To offset this, industrial and commercial users are charged higher rates. Nevertheless, even with this arrangement, the government subsidizes about 20% of the cost of electricity production. </p>
<p data-line-id="8030400c8f8546549c4d5fd2d9df65ad"> Given that electricity accounts for <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/decarbonizing%20india%20charting%20a%20pathway%20for%20sustainable%20growth/Decarbonising-India-Charting-a-pathway-for-sustainable-growth-ES-Oct-2022.pdf">34% of India’s total GHG emissions</a>, reforming electricity pricing is crucial to meeting its emissions-reduction goals. But this will not be easy, as electricity prices are set not by one central authority, but by the country’s 28 states and eight quasi-sovereign union territories. These 36 jurisdictions, each with its own policies and interests, represent the proverbial elephant in the room, complicating any effort to eliminate carbon subsidies. </p>
<p data-line-id="0637ac20de1c4885b47ddbb5799b4608"> Throughout India’s post-independence history, almost every state has subsidized electricity prices. Consequently, the expectation of free or cheap power has become deeply ingrained in the country’s democratic politics. While heavy subsidization has significantly expanded energy access, it also strains state governments’ finances, impeding clean-energy investments. In agricultural regions, free electricity has contributed to the degradation and depletion of water resources. Moreover, reliance on coal for power generation causes severe pollution-related health problems and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="0ee39050a2944a1897394edf04720012"> In Indian politics, which is increasingly prone to competitive populism between state governments, giving away free or cheaper power (along with cash transfers) is a stock currency of elected officials. The popularity of this approach has been evident in several recent elections, with parties promising electricity subsidies and following through after coming to power. Consequently, the price of power has steadily headed in the wrong direction: greater carbon subsidization instead of greater taxation. </p>
<p data-line-id="f8f5a8e32bee43618aa0ffc645034972"> India’s central government has tried to nudge state governments to rationalize electricity pricing, but with limited success. Likewise, measures, such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) or emission reporting requirements, are unlikely to have a significant impact. Such measures, protectionist in effect, are primarily aimed at tradable goods and services, sectors that are not heavily subsidized in India and for which the government is trying to establish a cap-and-trade system. Crucially, mechanisms like the CBAM will have minimal effect on the pricing of non-industrial electricity consumption. </p>
<p data-line-id="cf1bfec124c240b195d9754edfe1865c"> But the deeply rooted popularity of India’s electricity subsidies and resistance to reform do not necessarily mean that efforts to reduce emissions, both within India and worldwide, must fail. While India has little chance of changing how electricity is priced, it can change how it is produced. Demand may be beyond influence, but by shifting the power grid from fossil fuels to renewables, the country can supply cheap power while still reducing carbon emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="d6c684dab69542fc82c0ebcc2c1a3e85"> For this transition to be economically feasible, renewable energy and storage must be cheaper. Despite their protectionist nature, industrial policies like US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s Inflation Reduction Act could benefit developing countries like India. By lowering the costs of green-energy production and storage, such policies could make subsidized electricity less problematic from an emissions standpoint. </p>
<p data-line-id="17abf51fcf5b49268226ba29875321e2"> India’s experience offers some important lessons for policymakers and economists. Unanimous and vigorous advocacy for carbon taxation can be misguided because it ignores country realities. Barring an unforeseen shock, India’s 36 jurisdictions are unlikely to eliminate indirect carbon subsidies in electricity generation. It is crucial, therefore, to focus on identifying feasible solutions that could be developed and implemented within these political constraints. International financial support, for example, could significantly reduce the risks associated with renewable energy and storage projects in developing countries and make them more attractive for private investment. </p>
<p data-line-id="b9d82830cd95493f8ddf76417c44b45f"> What is clear is that simply invoking textbook solutions will get us nowhere. If the definition of insanity is repeatedly doing – or in this case evangelizing for – the same thing and expecting a different result, this particular madness will endanger us all. </p>

<p data-line-id="7cbad7ef48404a77aa1bbe84ff9e1c5d"> NEW YORK – Competition is what makes markets work (when they do). But firms don’t like competition because it tends to drive down profits. For the typical businessperson, whose objective is reaping gains above the normal return on capital, that is no fun. As Adam Smith <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Inquiry_into_the_Nature_and_Causes_of/HfHjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=People+of+the+same+trade+seldom+meet+together,+even+for+merriment+and+diversion,+but+the+conversation+ends+in+a+conspiracy+against+the+public,+or+in+some+contrivance+to+raise+prices&amp;printsec=frontcover">observed</a> 250 years ago, “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.” </p><p data-line-id="554b05c8e3e7475d96ed0ced97676f32"> For at least 130 years, the US government has been trying to ensure competition in the marketplace. But it has been a constant battle. Firms are always coming up with new ways to circumvent competition; their lawyers are always devising new methods to avoid the reach of the law; and the government has failed to keep up with either of these practices, let alone with rapid advances in technology. </p><p data-line-id="61eb2c818fc745958861f8fc5ce1dc6f"> Hence, there is now overwhelming evidence of an increase in <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-economy-rising-market-power-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2019-03">market power</a> in the United States. That means bigger corporate profits (far exceeding risk-adjusted returns), higher market concentration in sector after sector, and fewer new entrants. Americans like to think that they have the most dynamic economy the world has ever seen, one that is now on the cusp of a new innovative era. But the data refute such claims. </p>

<p data-line-id="97588aa06a044e788d3e7c6ea16eed91"> WASHINGTON, DC – As 2024 begins, the outlook for the global economy seems to be improving. Major economies are emerging mostly unscathed from the fastest rise in interest rates in 40 years, without the usual scars of financial crashes or high unemployment. Countries rarely succeed in taming steep inflation rates without triggering a recession. Yet a “soft landing” is now becoming more likely. Not surprisingly, financial markets are in a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/29/stocks-2023-sp-nasdaq-soaring-economy/">celebratory</a> mood. </p><p data-line-id="5815295968144189ba3ba8467a89c23a"> But caution is in order. The World Bank’s latest <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects"><em>Global Economic Prospects</em></a> indicates that most economies – developed as well as developing – will grow much more slowly in 2024 and 2025 than they did in the decade before COVID-19. Global growth is expected to decelerate for a third year in a row – to 2.4% – before ticking up to 2.7% in 2025. Per capita investment growth in 2023 and 2024 is expected to average just 3.7%, barely half the average of the previous two decades. </p><p data-line-id="6dd433f6e2694af5a12c996174ebda73"> The 2020s are shaping up to be an era of wasted opportunity. The end of 2024 will mark the halfway point of what was supposed to be a transformative decade for development – when extreme poverty was to be eliminated, major communicable diseases eradicated, and greenhouse-gas emissions nearly halved. What looms instead is a wretched milestone: the weakest global growth performance of any half-decade since 1990, with average per capita incomes in a quarter of all developing countries set to be lower at the end of 2024 than they were on the eve of COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p data-line-id="a5dbbe8ac76d4441ad64aa276698bbab"> TOKYO – Japan has had a difficult year so far. On January 1, as Japanese families gathered to celebrate the new year, a powerful <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/magnitude-74-earthquake-strikes-japan-tsunami-warning-issued-2024-01-01/">earthquake</a> shook the Noto peninsula, causing buildings to collapse and forcing mass evacuations. More than a week later, the death toll – <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/japan-quake-toll-rises-to-62-as-rescuers-struggle-to-reach-cut-off-villages">already in the dozens</a> – continues to rise, as road damage, heavy rains, and landslides impede rescuers’ ability to reach affected villages. </p><p data-line-id="5ad66f10f5b64c5683c69c117d24c8f3"> The next day, a Japan Airlines plane landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport collided on the runway with a Japanese coast-guard aircraft carrying supplies for earthquake refugees. All 367 passengers and 12 crew members were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/fire-breaks-out-plane-runway-japans-tokyo-haneda-airport-nhk-2024-01-02/">evacuated</a> safely from the burning passenger plane, but five of the six crew members aboard the smaller coast-guard aircraft died. </p><p data-line-id="6e97b41661c3439baa472ffc0e79b9bb"> Then, on January 4 – the first trading day of 2024 – the Tokyo stock market <a href="https://mercury.bloomberg.com/images/406014033">declined sharply</a>, owing to concerns about the damage from the earthquake. Although the market <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20240104/p2g/00m/0bu/030000c#:~:text=Tokyo%20stocks%20recovered%20in%20the,back%20of%20rising%20interest%20rates.">recovered</a> most of the early-morning losses the same afternoon, the yen has continued to weaken against both the US dollar – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/fx/USDJPY/historical-prices">falling</a> from ¥141 to the dollar to ¥145 in 2024<strong> </strong>– and the euro. Investors’ faith in the Bank of Japan’s readiness to normalize policy appears to be waning. </p>

Rajan: </strong>Monetary policy is a blunt tool, as many have recognized. With an active financial sector, it also becomes a tool with uncertain consequences, since the financial sector can react to extreme monetary-policy settings in unpredictable – and undesirable – ways. For example, a sustained policy of low interest rates engenders risk-taking and leveraging by the financial sector, leaving it exposed to losses when the policy setting changes.</p><p data-line-id="cfe84dd8eac741709810d1cd2f47972d">This has happened so many times that no one can claim to be surprised anymore. Yet monetary authorities sometimes act as if someone else – bank management, regulators, supervisors – is responsible for dealing with the spillovers from their policies. A scapegoat is always found, allowing central bankers to avoid accountability. The US Federal Reserve’s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230428a.htm">Barr Report</a> on the demise of Silicon Valley Bank is a case in point. The report flags the usual suspects, beginning with the bank’s senior management. But there is no hint that Fed policy – for instance, quantitative easing and its subsequent rollback – might have contributed. This wasn’t even included in the terms of reference for the inquiry!</p>

Just as the events of 1979 doomed Carter’s re-election hopes the following year, developments in 2023 are said to have effectively sunk Biden’s bid for a second term in November. </p><p data-line-id="b7326699b37b48b4ab56c9f8da0f59ff"> Most obviously, both Carter and Biden confronted a demoralizing inflation problem. But Carter-era inflation was far worse: in November 1979, a year prior to the election, consumer price inflation in the United States was running at <a href="https://cpiinflationcalculator.com/1979-cpi-inflation-united-states/">12.6%</a>. In the 12 months ending in November 2023, in contrast, CPI inflation was a modest <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/consumer-prices-up-3-1-percent-from-november-2022-to-november-2023.htm#:~:text=Consumer%20prices%20up%203.1%20percent%20from%20November%202022%20to%20November%202023,-December%2020%2C%202023&amp;text=Over%20the%20year%20ended%20November,October%202022%20to%20October%202023.">3.1%</a>. But inflation does remain a political liability for Biden, regardless of whether the phenomenon is now largely in the rearview mirror. </p><p data-line-id="23948696bc31414b85187b1eb84230b9"> Second, Biden, like Carter before him, has given the Federal Reserve free rein to tackle the problem. Carter selected <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-volcker">Paul Volcker</a> to chair the US Federal Reserve Board largely for Volcker’s inflation-fighting credentials, in full knowledge that the new chair would <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/10/31/paul-volcker-jimmy-carter-donald-trump/">jack up interest rates</a>. Despite warnings from his political adviser, Bert Lance, that Volcker’s appointment would <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/7637/chapter/152671419">doom</a> the president’s re-election prospects, Carter then let Volcker go about his business. Carter’s hands-off approach during the run-up to an election was quite different from that of some of his predecessors, in particular Richard Nixon before the 1972 election. </p>

<p data-line-id="b479a25780074ab1b19d09eb59a0b661"> CAMBRIDGE – Another tumultuous year has confirmed that the global economy is at a turning point. We face four big challenges: the climate transition, the good-jobs problem, an economic-development crisis, and the search for a newer, healthier form of globalization. To address each, we must leave behind established modes of thinking and seek creative workable solutions, while recognizing that these efforts will be necessarily uncoordinated and experimental. </p><p data-line-id="10c66a0209754044a1657f9429a61be6"> Climate change is the most daunting challenge, and the one that has been overlooked the longest – at great cost. If we are to avoid condemning humanity to a dystopian future, we must act fast to decarbonize the global economy. We have long known that we must wean ourselves from fossil fuels, develop green alternatives, and shore up our defenses against the lasting environmental damage that past inaction has already caused. However, it has become clear that little of this is likely to be achieved through global cooperation or economists’ favored policies. </p><p data-line-id="0c6fd1336f364885b6de3f5a85176889"> Instead, individual countries will forge ahead with their own green agendas, implementing policies that best account for their specific political constraints, as the United States, China, and the European Union have already been doing. The result will be a hodge-podge of emission caps, tax incentives, research and development support, and green industrial policies with little global coherence and occasional costs for other countries. Messy though it may be, an uncoordinated push for climate action <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fighting-climate-change-priority-over-wto-trade-rules-by-dani-rodrik-2022-12">may be the best</a> we can realistically hope for. </p>

For the European Union, this will translate largely into an effort to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, especially of critical goods. For the United States, the focus will be on maintaining military supremacy by denying potential adversaries – namely, China – access to relevant technologies. Both approaches overlap in an important area: the chips industry. </p><p data-line-id="8a5b1755cb544793818052cb9fa0e418"> Because advanced microchips are central to many advanced weapons systems and integral to economic security and prosperity, the industry has become a key arena in today’s geopolitical competition. To improve their chances of prevailing in the “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Chip-War/Chris-Miller/9781982172008">chip war</a>,” all large economic powers have implemented major programs to support their domestic chip makers. </p><p data-line-id="86243ace647b48a1a8b6593e0b6325c9"> The US enacted the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346">CHIPS and Science Act</a> in 2022.

<p data-line-id="2bea5300cd0b4b1b82b3b31d87673685"> CHICAGO – With long-gestating antitrust cases against Google, Apple, and Amazon coming to fruition, many observers think that 2024 could be a turning point for Big Tech. Yet even as authorities press ahead with this litigation, they risk being blindsided by the rise of artificial intelligence, which is likely to reinforce Big Tech’s dominance of the economy. </p><p data-line-id="1383eaec72ba4725ad1b1105a4e7c4cf"> The recent firing and rehiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was interpreted as a conflict between cautious board members who worried about the risks of AI and enthusiasts like Altman. But the real significance of this episode was what it revealed about OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft, the largest investor in OpenAI’s commercial operations. While OpenAI’s nonprofit structure nominally means that only its board controls it, the board was forced to rehire Altman after Microsoft expressed misgivings that helped instigate an employee revolt. </p><p data-line-id="065fba98f5b240d9a0d92dd93d68581c"> Microsoft is not just an investor in OpenAI; it is also a competitor. Both companies develop and sell AI products, and Microsoft had stopped short of acquiring OpenAI to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/microsoft-s-answer-to-openai-inquiry-it-doesn-t-own-a-stake">avoid antitrust problems</a>. But if Microsoft controls or partly controls OpenAI, the two companies may have an illegal collusive relationship. That is why the US Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-antitrust-regulator-considering-microsoft-openai-partnership-2023-12-08/">competition authority</a> are both <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/ftc-makes-preliminary-antitrust-queries-into-microsoft-openai">investigating</a> the matter. </p>

<p data-line-id="cffb87f509b745ed90d479076ae5a016"> NEW HAVEN – Currency fluctuations affect different populations in different ways. Consider the recent <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;to=JPY&amp;view=5Y">decline of the yen</a>, which slid from around ¥103 against the dollar at the end of 2020 to a multi-decade low of around ¥151 in late 2023. The weak yen has forced some of my economist friends in Japan to cancel their research trips to the United States because their grants now fall far short of travel expenses. On the other hand, Japan’s tourism sector is booming, as a trip to Tokyo has become a bargain. </p><p data-line-id="92f37925860947efb86999c8ee5c3e11"> This raises the question of whether a local currency’s appreciation or depreciation is more desirable for boosting macroeconomic performance. In the case of Japan, an archipelago that is heavily dependent on trade, a stronger yen could be beneficial, because the terms of trade usually improve as the currency’s value rises. The same volume of exports would translate into more imports. </p><p data-line-id="c1a49196edf9491eb6d1c97e6541ba7b"> But when a country earns substantial revenues from overseas investment, a weaker local currency increases consumption opportunities. For example, the Government Office of Japan estimates that the country’s gross national income (GNI) was 6% <a href="https://www.jcer.or.jp/english/what-the-gdp-figures-for-2023-q2-tell-us">higher</a> than its GDP in July 2023, largely owing to a cheap yen. This indicates that Japanese who receive more income from foreign investment now enjoy greater purchasing power. </p>

<p data-line-id="3519b9ac43cc49139770d66bb8b44204"> NEW YORK – Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black female president, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/02/us/claudine-gay-harvard">forced to resign</a> after weeks of pressure to step down. But everyone involved in the controversy that pushed her out looks bad. </p><p data-line-id="ce269dcd4cc1457ba7eb39e3e5f2c404"> The ostensible reason for her ouster was sloppy academic writing – mostly the failure to credit other academics whom she quoted almost word for word in previously published work. But those discoveries followed allegations of anti-Semitism and double standards. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/us/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism.html">asked</a> by Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik whether student demonstrators “calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard’s code of conduct,” Gay replied that it “depends on the context.” </p><p data-line-id="a8f472bfa00b45228235f019573f8da1"> There is little doubt that if the question had referred to the genocide of Black people, context would not have been required. But Gay was walking into a nasty trap. Stefanik had deliberately blurred the distinction between calling for genocide and supporting a Palestinian intifada (armed rebellion). The latter may involve violence, but it is not genocidal. </p>

Falling but still-sticky inflation suggested that monetary policy would grow tighter before rapidly easing once the recession hit; stock markets would fall, and bond yields would remain high.  </p><p data-line-id="3b995f2365ee4473be35e45173522a74"> Instead, the opposite mostly happened. Inflation fell more than expected, a recession was avoided, stock markets rose, and bond yields fell after going higher. </p><p data-line-id="04bc5a5a24b84c36b69cc66c837674cf"> One therefore must approach any 2024 forecast with humility. Still, the basic task is the same: start with a baseline, an upside, and a downside scenario, and then assign time-varying probabilities to each. </p>

<p data-line-id="d77bd3abcead48cb87b0201320fcfd79"> LONDON – We have just witnessed the start of a paradigm shift in earth science. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3">paper</a> published in <em>Nature</em> in July showed that a neural network (artificial intelligence) predicted weather better than the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which has the world’s most advanced forecasting system. Then, in November, Google’s DeepMind <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2336">announced</a> that its weather-forecasting AI had produced even stronger predictions. </p><p data-line-id="e7e1fe36c46a4161aa8d3fd2c077af11"> The traditional approach to weather forecasting is to use observations taken at a point in time as initial conditions for equations based on physical principles. By contrast, an AI will ingest data collected over long periods of time and then “learn” the dynamics that traditional equations must describe explicitly. Both the traditional and the AI-based method rely on supercomputers, but the AI has no need for formally developed theories. </p><p data-line-id="a2535dbde7174a508c6bb0dcc405aba5"> Weather forecasting determines when and where planes fly, which routes ships take, and helps manage all manner of civilian and military risks that come with a variable environment. It matters. While these are still relatively early days for AI applications in this field, and much still needs to be worked out, as in other sectors, AI-driven forecasting may displace skilled labor, since neural networks don’t require knowledge of dynamical meteorology (the authors of the <em>Nature</em> paper are engineers with no such background). But the implications hardly stop there. </p>

<p data-line-id="65c40f7dddd546459abe208ba7f6889b"> TEL AVIV – This week, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-netanyahu.html">ruled on two major bills</a> pushed by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s far-right government as part of its judicial overhaul. The decision to strike down the first and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israels-supreme-court-delays-activation-law-makes-harder-106075989">delay activation</a> of the second until after the next general election delivered a historic victory for Israel’s democratic forces. </p><p data-line-id="21b96228452c416e9a4cb287fc34d041"> The first bill would have eliminated the Supreme Court’s power to block “extremely unreasonable” government decisions. The second bill, explicitly tailored for Netanyahu, who currently is on trial for corruption, sought to bar Israel’s attorney general from declaring him unfit for office if he attempts to interfere with the criminal proceedings, and stipulated that the prime minister could be declared incapacitated only for health reasons. Both bills were approved by the Knesset during the summer as amendments to Israel’s Basic Laws, which serve as the country’s de facto constitution. </p><p data-line-id="177b36ff75d4492abed4182b0b6d82c9"> These rulings mark a watershed moment for Israeli democracy. By striking down the government’s judicial overhaul, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that wartime unity necessitates tolerating Netanyahu’s erosion of democratic norms. In a narrow 8-7 majority, the Court upheld the reasonableness standard, rebuking the ruling coalition for causing “severe and unprecedented harm” to Israel’s democratic character. </p>

<p data-line-id="f30f286e0e81410b895c28025af50ed9"> MELBOURNE – Last month, I was invited to join other Princeton University academics in viewing a compilation of raw footage from GoPro cameras carried by Hamas gunmen killing civilians in Israel on October 7. Additional video and audio material came from dashboard cameras, traffic cameras, phone intercepts, and victims’ phones. </p><p data-line-id="7fd3e261817448afa09ddde98ab7b370"> The invitation carried a warning that the footage would show horrific violence and murder. I avoid violent movies, so my instinctive response was to decline the invitation. But as someone who often points to the progress that we have made, over millennia, in expanding the circle of moral concern, I decided that I should be willing to see something that would challenge my optimism. </p><p data-line-id="246fef7edf6b4833b67466c3b1e9fbe8"> Evil is a word I rarely use, but what I saw was evil in its purest form: men armed with assault rifles going house to house to shoot defenseless and terrified families in their simple kibbutz homes, recording their murders and shouting “God is Great.” They kill a father in front of his two young children. They cut off the head of one of their victims, saying they will give it to the crowd to play with. We see panicked young people at a music festival shot dead as they try to hide or flee. I was seeing only a fraction of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/israel-revises-death-toll-from-october-7-hamas-attack-to-1200-people">1,200 murders</a> Hamas forces committed on that day, according to official Israeli figures. </p>

<p data-line-id="cf7fb0590ec04f5e8d0258bbc46a798f"> LONDON – It has now been more than 15 years since the white heat of the global financial crisis, when Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and the Royal Bank of Scotland (among others) failed. At the time, big banks deserved the tidal wave of opprobrium that came their way, and they duly accepted huge increases in capital requirements, dividend bans, and other controls on distributions and pay. Just a few years ago, those who put their heads above the parapet to argue that enough was enough still found bullets whistling past their ears. </p><p data-line-id="60ff81d7adf04f288959d9ab1338f004"> But has the mood finally changed? Have banks’ political reputations been rehabilitated now that the ravages of financial crisis have receded into the past, and following a pandemic in which they were part of the solution, rather than the origin of the problem? The answers to such questions depend very much on geography. </p><p data-line-id="aabf08b273cd4a458edec58b1b7ed0c7"> For example, if you are in the United States, three notable bank failures in 2023 – Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, and Signature Bank – might lead you to expect that banks are pariahs. But that has not stopped US banks from adopting an aggressive stance in relation to the US Federal Reserve’s proposals for rigorous implementation of the final part of the Basel 3 capital reforms. </p>

<p data-line-id="1313b6c4b59540468435e4e875be8508"> NEW YORK – The global economy demonstrated remarkable resilience in 2023, as the United States defied expectations and managed to avoid a recession. India, Vietnam, and Japan also achieved impressive economic performance given the circumstances. But while these countries have good reasons to be optimistic about 2024, China will most likely be the single largest contributor to global GDP growth this year. </p><p data-line-id="b20464c684484ee89bab691e4594fc87"> This may come as a surprise to many, given the wave of increasingly gloomy forecasts for the Chinese economy. To be sure, China may not reach its full potential in 2024. Only by pursuing meaningful reforms and reaffirming economic openness (the two pillars of the country’s remarkably successful growth model over the past four decades) can it regain its lost momentum. </p><p data-line-id="05a4ae095c654abdb343f1a91f10ec1c"> The relative contribution of a country to global GDP growth depends on both its share in the world economy and its relative economic growth. In purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms, China’s share of the world economy was <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">18.8%</a> in 2023, compared to America’s 15.4%.

<p data-line-id="ab533137af6a417baaf719d0502ce790"> NEW DELHI – India begins the New Year with a general election looming, and the battle lines are already clear. On one side is Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On the other is a slew of opposition parties that are largely, though not wholly, clustered around the Indian National Congress party, and together form the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/opposition-alliance-named-india-indian-national-democratic-inclusive-alliance/articleshow/101856873.cms?from=mdr">Indian National Developmental and Inclusive Alliance</a> (INDIA). </p><p data-line-id="c522fa6ec7a94ecb9bd19bf47f4c0721"> The BJP’s narrative has undergone significant changes during the party’s decade in power. During the 2014 campaign, the BJP’s slogan was <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/counterrevolution-will-televised-current-crisis-indian-universities/"><em>achhe din</em><em>aane waale hain</em></a><em> </em>(“good times are coming”), and Modi, who had been chief minister of the prosperous state of Gujarat since 2001, was portrayed as an avatar of economic development. As prime minister, the narrative went, he would transform the Indian economy, bringing prosperity – including <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/what-about-modis-2-crore-jobs-promise-sibals-dig-at-bhagwats-remarks/articleshow/97636257.cms">20 million new jobs</a> per year – to all. </p><p data-line-id="5aba3ede0ff246e986ccc70ab6bb9486"> Far from delivering broad-based prosperity, during his first term Modi oversaw a disastrous <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-demonetization-policy-consequences-by-shashi-tharoor-2016-12?barrier=accesspaylog">demonetization</a> process that nullified 86% of India’s currency in one fell swoop, causing widespread hardship and mass unemployment.

<p data-line-id="11f623b33b444d3aa2fad9324202eec1"> PRINCETON – Ever since the double shock of 2016 – when British voters decided to pull their country out of the European Union, and Americans elected Donald Trump as their president – we have been told that liberalism is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/books/review/what-was-liberalism-james-traub-the-stakes-robert-kuttner.html">in crisis</a>. But which liberalism? Are we talking about a set of ideals, or about institutions such as the much-criticized “liberal global order,” or only about recent policies pursued in a number of Western countries, which may or may not have anything to do with a political philosophy plausibly labeled liberalism? </p><p data-line-id="75cace258d014598b384e0300996563d"> We can ask similar questions about the word “crisis.” Are authors in what has become a “crisis-of-liberalism” cottage industry referring to a life-or-death moment, as in the original Greek meaning, or to something more mundane, such as policy failures? </p><p data-line-id="a0d70f557e82493f8a953b7832c3e637"> Recent books chart possible answers. Patrick J. Deneen, a political theorist at the University of Notre Dame, heartily <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300240023/why-liberalism-failed/">welcomes the crisis</a> and hopes that it will lead to liberalism’s ideological and practical demise. He thinks it should be replaced with something entirely different, and he wants his book to serve as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/08/the-new-right-patrick-deneen-00100279">manual</a> for a new “elite” – a “party of order” – to bring about “regime change” and vanquish the “party of progress.” </p>

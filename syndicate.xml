<p data-line-id="ab533137af6a417baaf719d0502ce790"> NEW DELHI – India begins the New Year with a general election looming, and the battle lines are already clear. On one side is Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On the other is a slew of opposition parties that are largely, though not wholly, clustered around the Indian National Congress party, and together form the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/opposition-alliance-named-india-indian-national-democratic-inclusive-alliance/articleshow/101856873.cms?from=mdr">Indian National Developmental and Inclusive Alliance</a> (INDIA). </p>
<p data-line-id="c522fa6ec7a94ecb9bd19bf47f4c0721"> The BJP’s narrative has undergone significant changes during the party’s decade in power. During the 2014 campaign, the BJP’s slogan was <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/counterrevolution-will-televised-current-crisis-indian-universities/"><em>achhe din</em><em>aane waale hain</em></a><em> </em>(“good times are coming”), and Modi, who had been chief minister of the prosperous state of Gujarat since 2001, was portrayed as an avatar of economic development. As prime minister, the narrative went, he would transform the Indian economy, bringing prosperity – including <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/what-about-modis-2-crore-jobs-promise-sibals-dig-at-bhagwats-remarks/articleshow/97636257.cms">20 million new jobs</a> per year – to all. </p>
<p data-line-id="5aba3ede0ff246e986ccc70ab6bb9486"> Far from delivering broad-based prosperity, during his first term Modi oversaw a disastrous <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-demonetization-policy-consequences-by-shashi-tharoor-2016-12?barrier=accesspaylog">demonetization</a> process that nullified 86% of India’s currency in one fell swoop, causing widespread hardship and mass unemployment. So, for the 2019 election, a new narrative was needed. </p>
<p data-line-id="4f2a496a07b94e8c94f25056932608ce"> The BJP found it when, two months before the vote, Pakistan-based militants carried out a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/topic/pulwama-attack-2019/">suicide attack</a> in the Pulwama district of Kashmir, killing 40 Indian paramilitary troops. The BJP then went to work recasting the election as a national-security referendum. Modi, previously portrayed as the former CEO of Gujarat, Inc., was positioned as a warrior with a 56-inch chest who would keep India safe from Pakistani depredations. A much-hyped Indian <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/INDIA-KASHMIR/010090XM162/index.html">air strike</a> targeting an alleged militant base inside Pakistan sealed Modi’s new image and tilted the electorate in his favor, especially in the northern Indian states. </p>
<p data-line-id="b54ee18ed18a48448c46c3ab3956a1ac"> But, during his second term, Modi again failed to live up to the narrative that got him elected. His assiduously cultivated tough-guy image might have played well against his domestic opponents, but it did not impress China, whose military has steadily <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484">encroached</a> on its disputed Himalayan frontier with India. </p>
<p data-line-id="9027e1436cf84892850c2469a6e79454"> It was on Modi’s watch that 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476#:~:text=At%20least%2020%20Indian%20soldiers,in%20at%20least%2045%20years.">first deadly clash</a> with China in the area in at least 45 years. China has also managed to <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/india-has-lost-access-to-26-of-65-patrolling-points-in-ladakh-says-research-paper/">cut off India’s access</a> to 26 of 65 points that used to be patrolled by both sides. Modi has failed to secure a withdrawal of Chinese troops and restore the status quo ante. </p>
<p data-line-id="131293f4743441fc896f121df9ff124b"> So, the national-security narrative of 2019 has also lost credibility, compelling the BJP to devise yet another for the coming election As 2024 begins, they are seeking to portray Modi as a <a href="https://madrascourier.com/opinion/tracking-hindu-hriday-samrat-as-a-political-slogan/"><em>Hindu Hriday Samrat</em></a> – an “emperor of Hindu hearts.” </p>
<p data-line-id="ba6fb9e8481e470e8e8da7228b1be3bc"> In a sense, the BJP is going back to basics with this approach. It has long been known as the party of Hindu nationalism, and Modi himself is associated with a notorious anti-Muslim <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre">pogrom</a> that left nearly 2,000 people dead in Gujarat in 2002 (when he was chief minister). It was partly to shake off this association that Modi was reinvented as an economic hero in the 2014 campaign, though even then, the BJP proclaimed Modi’s religious nationalism on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/hoardings-across-mumbai-turn-spotlight-on-narendra-modis-hindu-nationalist-remark/articleshow/21131616.cms">billboards</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="f142215b488747c6a019c546f056d618"> During his decade in office, Modi has increasingly asserted the dominance of Hindu Indians, who comprise some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/21/key-findings-about-the-religious-composition-of-india/">80%</a> of the country’s population. A series of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/05/narendra-modi-india-religion-hindu-nationalism/630169/">government actions</a> advanced the BJP’s goal of unraveling the cosmopolitan secularism that characterized Indian politics for more than six decades after independence. </p>
<p data-line-id="41ca0c7f0ca24ad8a069eef3c40e84c4"> Now, the BJP is doubling down on its portrayal of Modi as a true Hindu, and thus a more authentic representative of “the people” than the left-leaning secularists he replaced. This effort will reach a crescendo on January 22, when <a href="https://m.timesofindia.com/india/whole-world-waiting-for-22nd-january-pm-modi-in-ayodhya/articleshow/106388185.cms">Modi inaugurates</a> the Ram Mandir temple in Ayodhya. </p>
<p data-line-id="214ef1457f624c198c428526ee6124a7"> The BJP long promised to build a grand Hindu temple at the site of the <a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/the-babri-masjid-demolition-inalterably-changed-the-trajectory-of-indias-history#:~:text=A%20violent%20mob%20mobilised%20by,the%20trajectory%20of%20our%20history.">Babri Masjid</a>, a disused mosque that was demolished in 1992 by Hindu extremists who believed, along with many ordinary Hindus, that it had been built on the site of the birthplace of the Hindu god Shri Ram. The Ram Mandir temple represents the fulfillment of this promise, and its inauguration will be accompanied by considerable fanfare across India, particularly in the northern states. All this is expected to bolster support for the ruling party’s Hindutva doctrine. </p>
<p data-line-id="960438ede7344cf1b18ee1e18def70c2"> Soon after, on February 14, Modi will head to Abu Dhabi, where he will triumphantly inaugurate the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/abu-dhabi-temple-baps-narendra-modi-9087742/">first Hindu temple</a> in the United Arab Emirates, the BAPS Hindu Mandir. Modi already touts his independent foreign policy and boasts that he has enhanced India’s global stature. The inauguration of the BAPS Hindu Mandir will be an opportunity for the BJP to augment this narrative with the claim that Modi has increased respect for Hinduism abroad. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d0119b459d24766acd9107b0d418b76"> The election is likely to be announced soon after that event. This will send a clear message: the BJP is seeking a third mandate for a Hindu hero. A vote for Modi, the party will suggest, amounts to an affirmation of pride in one’s Hindu identity. </p>
<p data-line-id="f7c99040295d47be8c1dfe6f51bd3ecb"> The INDIA bloc should not seek to fight Modi on his turf. With the BJP having laid claim to most of the weapons in the Hindu-chauvinist arsenal, the opposition cannot win on that battleground. Instead, INDIA should take a lesson from the 1992 presidential election in the United States, reminding voters (and itself) that “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/back-to-the-future-its-the-economy-stupid/">it’s the economy, stupid</a>.” </p>
<p data-line-id="0426f50f397f4b4cbee3b5f4e6f0d129"> What happened to <em>achhe din</em>? What happened to 20 million jobs per year? What happened to broad-based economic growth? What happened to putting disposable income into the pockets and bank accounts of every Indian? In an election that will pit Hindutva against Indians’ material well-being, INDIA’s task is to put these questions at the center of the campaign. Stay tuned. </p>

<p data-line-id="11f623b33b444d3aa2fad9324202eec1"> PRINCETON – Ever since the double shock of 2016 – when British voters decided to pull their country out of the European Union, and Americans elected Donald Trump as their president – we have been told that liberalism is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/books/review/what-was-liberalism-james-traub-the-stakes-robert-kuttner.html">in crisis</a>. But which liberalism? Are we talking about a set of ideals, or about institutions such as the much-criticized “liberal global order,” or only about recent policies pursued in a number of Western countries, which may or may not have anything to do with a political philosophy plausibly labeled liberalism? </p><p data-line-id="75cace258d014598b384e0300996563d"> We can ask similar questions about the word “crisis.” Are authors in what has become a “crisis-of-liberalism” cottage industry referring to a life-or-death moment, as in the original Greek meaning, or to something more mundane, such as policy failures? </p><p data-line-id="a0d70f557e82493f8a953b7832c3e637"> Recent books chart possible answers. Patrick J. Deneen, a political theorist at the University of Notre Dame, heartily <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300240023/why-liberalism-failed/">welcomes the crisis</a> and hopes that it will lead to liberalism’s ideological and practical demise. He thinks it should be replaced with something entirely different, and he wants his book to serve as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/06/08/the-new-right-patrick-deneen-00100279">manual</a> for a new “elite” – a “party of order” – to bring about “regime change” and vanquish the “party of progress.” </p>

<p data-line-id="ea863fb9852549a7bdcb48b3b3f1085b"> NEW YORK – As Russia’s war against Ukraine continues to wreak havoc both regionally and globally, the Ukrainian people and their allies demonstrate remarkable determination and courage. But nearly two years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, it is increasingly clear that the international community can and must do much more to help. </p><p data-line-id="2ac2e565b46f429e97333e82f0c50942"> While the G7 countries and other governments around the world have been extraordinarily generous in supporting the Ukrainian war effort, there are signs of growing fatigue in some circles – a development Russia appears to have anticipated. With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/us/politics/ukraine-us-military-aid.html">United States</a> and the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/deb40df7-7832-4fee-a822-655ab0288c05">European Union</a> failing to commit more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine in December, the idea of seizing Russian assets frozen by Western countries has re-emerged as a potential solution. </p><p data-line-id="950c43d020224993b2b0bbf1320d64a4"> Although seizing these assets would boost Ukrainian morale and finances, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic are wary. As <em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/us/politics/russian-assets-ukraine.html">recently reported</a>, top US officials fear that setting such a precedent would deter other countries from depositing their funds at the New York Federal Reserve or holding them in dollars. </p>

<p data-line-id="0c52f403ffb24babb179e75530ac6e8d"> BERLIN – In 2015, all 193 members of the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/historic-new-sustainable-development-agenda-unanimously-adopted-by-193-un-members/">agreed</a> to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – a broad policy agenda aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet, and promoting well-being for all – by 2030. Now, eight years on, the UN’s Global Sustainable Development Report 2023 (GSDR) <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/gsdr/gsdr2023">warns</a> that the world is far from meeting these targets. <a href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/165-million-people-fell-poverty-between-2020-2023-debt-servicing-crowded-out-social-protection-health-and-education-expenditures">Poverty</a> and <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/122-million-more-people-pushed-hunger-2019-due-multiple-crises-reveals-un-report">hunger</a> are increasing, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/26/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-global-energy-industry-still-rising-report">continued to rise</a>, and, at the current rate of progress, it will take <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/">300 years</a> to achieve gender equality. </p>
<p data-line-id="8082e6f9f6e84cf5bc53b52a3a5a3191"> The COVID-19 pandemic’s devastating social and economic impact certainly pushed us off track, as did the war in Ukraine. But the transformative action required to meet the SDGs has also been lacking. As the GSDR shows, incremental steps and targeted interventions will not suffice. Instead, we need sweeping reforms that pursue several SDGs at once. </p>
<p data-line-id="897bd8120c8f4b2b8cc76bbed1c38e97"> According to the GSDR, the sustainability transformation is a process in which new technologies, infrastructure, and decision-making approaches replace old ones, addressing the negative effects of the existing versions and producing better results. This change is usually met with resistance and can lead to conflict, because it has a cost: companies need to find new business models and markets, and workers are forced to retrain and then find new jobs. Policymakers should anticipate and plan for these outcomes. </p>
<p data-line-id="5b4835f743fe4a54bc6ead3a9113ad90"> One such innovation is renewable energy. But in most countries, renewables are a complement rather than replacement for fossil fuels. Making a full switch, however, is necessary to reach <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2050-long-term-strategy_en#:~:text=The%20EU%20aims%20to%20be,action%20under%20the%20Paris%20Agreement%20.">net-zero GHG emissions</a>, which the European Union aims to achieve by 2050. In addition to the large-scale deployment of renewables and clean technologies such as electric vehicles, it will be crucial to scale up investment in energy infrastructure, especially in Africa, and improve energy efficiency. Social innovations that emphasize the collective provision and use of space and mobility services can also help reduce energy use. </p>
<p data-line-id="760aedc83c21470082afca8117e146d7"> Sweeping changes are also needed to end hunger and halt biodiversity loss. People in wealthy countries should drastically reduce their meat consumption, adopt plant-based diets, and halve food waste. Globally, agriculture must adopt low-input and multifunctional production systems that preserve land, water, and biodiversity, and the use of persistent pollutants such as heavy metals and plastics must be cut significantly to ensure a healthy environment. </p>
<p data-line-id="4d18745dc71547ceace3ad3402633b3c"> To promote human well-being and inclusion, policymakers must relentlessly pursue gender-equality objectives, which requires strengthening women’s legal status and economic autonomy. Moreover, putting a price on carbon in high-emitting countries could generate revenue for a global fund for social protection that low-income countries can use to improve education and health services. This would go a long way toward reducing poverty. </p>
<p data-line-id="97fd1d2e576045bb9d2132769e290e77"> Transformation on this scale will not be easy to achieve. That is where the power of narrative comes in: people must be convinced that these changes are the best way to build a livable future, and that our current trajectory leads only to catastrophic outcomes that threaten human existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="d42c81b30e3946d283cb8a88b611f563"> To shift the narrative, policymakers will have to learn how to shore up and maintain broad-based political and societal support for wholesale change. That means focusing more on common purpose than partisan conflict, developing long-term strategies that can achieve a just green transformation, and being proactive about identifying and resolving conflicts over the distribution of costs. It also means working with civil society, the private sector, and trade unions to identify implementation problems and adjust policies accordingly. Developing partnerships that enable mutual learning and exchange within and across regions can help build this capacity. </p>
<p data-line-id="593f72b2b1ff4fcdabe5669c6e45167a"> Democratic processes are fundamental to designing policies that fairly distribute the costs of transformation. The magnitude of the change required, however, is so enormous that anyone whose business or livelihood is affected will resist reform. Especially in societies with high levels of income and wealth inequality, people are more likely to believe that they will be worse off during such a paradigm shift. </p>
<p data-line-id="48da812fe8d047218839eb0d9f294f1a"> That is why policymakers must put equity and justice at the center of this transformation and commit to transparency and accountability in determining how costs should be shared across different income groups and generations. Monitoring progress against agreed targets, in particular, would enable the public to hold government accountable, strengthening the rule of law and building trust in institutions. </p>
<p data-line-id="b2f8bd95003141a29137682ff50175a8"> As much as achieving the SDGs depends on democratic consensus, pursuing these radical but necessary reforms could in turn strengthen democracy. </p>

<p data-line-id="3611121f468841ec99a07a596e52fde6"> BEIJING – China’s economic performance over the last year has been disappointing – so much so that some observers argue that growth has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/briefing/china-economy.html">peaked</a>, and that it is all <a href="https://nytimes.com/2023/08/15/business/china-economy-downturn-unemployment.html">downhill</a> from here. But it is far too soon to write off China’s economic resilience. </p><p data-line-id="cd9fe69d873240369b77bc449f32a75b"> As 2023 began, the lifting of draconian “zero-COVID” restrictions fueled a kind of domestic euphoria, reflected in <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/china-consumption-start-of-a-new-era">soaring consumption</a>. But the picture soon darkened, with the second quarter bringing declining exports, stagnating retail sales, shrinking corporate profits, local-government spending cuts, and a weakening housing sector. Chinese business confidence <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb73774a-a130-4769-80a5-6115555b22a1">plummeted</a>, and foreign businesses were spooked. In November, China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-first-deficit-foreign-investment-signals-wests-de-risking-pressure-2023-11-06/">recorded</a> its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. </p><p data-line-id="ab27e42de24a4cb6bb84ab8801e5c368"> Even so, China’s economy will probably grow by at least 5% this year – a respectable rate, by international standards. More important, China’s economy still has a lot of fuel in the tank: a record-high <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/economy/china-record-savings-revenge-spending-intl-hnk/index.html">savings rate</a> means that it still has plenty of cheap finance for investment and innovation. </p>

<p data-line-id="5bec99161580437296132b6c1cfd9fe0"> DAKAR – The widening <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12800">debt crisis</a> in the Global South largely emanates from a flawed <a href="https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt">multilateral system</a>. But it also reflects the inadequacies of the dominant analytical and policy frameworks – specifically, their assumptions about the nature of money, the economic possibilities available to currency-issuing governments, and the underlying causes of developing countries’ external indebtedness. </p><p data-line-id="30ae81beb80b48ceb926746f483e4f8a"> Viewed through the lens of Modern Monetary Theory (<a href="https://books.google.sn/books/about/Macroeconomics.html?id=kTxBMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">MMT</a>), the limitations of mainstream economic thinking as applied to sovereign-debt crises become even clearer. The basic idea behind MMT is that, unlike households or private firms, governments that control their own fiat currency cannot default (assuming their debt is denominated in their own currency). As they are not money-constrained, they can spend to achieve their goals. Their main constraint is the availability of productive capacity, which determines the risk of inflation. </p><p data-line-id="07977233e12745bba838e905a9076c48"> MMT explains why the most indebted countries, in absolute and relative terms, are not in distress. Consider that Japan’s <a href="https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm">sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio</a> was 254% last year, while the ratio was 144% in the United States, 113% in Canada, and 104% in the United Kingdom. Yet none of these countries is experiencing a sovereign-debt crisis. By contrast, in 2020, Argentina, Ecuador, and Zambia had much lower <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/debt-statistics/idr/products">debt-to-GDP ratios</a> when they <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/220504-default-transition-and-recovery-2021-annual-global-sovereign-default-and-rating-transition-study-12350530">defaulted</a> on their external obligations. </p>

<p data-line-id="5cd0555138cf4f6e914aa07f85fd7a5f"> CAMBRIDGE – When Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/14/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">met</a> with US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> last fall, some interpreted it as a return to engagement. In fact, it heralded only a minor détente, not a major change in policy. </p><p data-line-id="2ec13e3f7fcb44bd953cdbf15be1d75d"> The United States’ engagement with the People’s Republic of China <a href="https://www.history.com/news/nixon-china-visit-cold-war">began</a> with Richard Nixon in 1972 and was expanded by Bill Clinton. Since then, critics have described US policy as naive, owing to its failure to understand the Communist Party of China’s long-term objectives. Underpinning the policy was the prediction, from modernization theory, that economic growth would propel China down the same liberalizing path as other Confucian societies like South Korea and Taiwan. Xi, however, has made China more closed and autocratic. </p><p data-line-id="25c2d2fd50814059b426abb2612d20bb"> Still, America’s engagement policy always had a realistic dimension. While Nixon wanted to engage China to balance the Soviet threat, Clinton made sure that engagement accompanied a reaffirmation of the US-Japan <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/relation/visit_C/jointpress.html">security treaty</a> for the post-Cold War era. Those who accuse Clinton of naivete ignore that this hedge came first, and that the US-Japan alliance remains a robust and fundamental element of the balance of power in Asia today. </p>

<p data-line-id="bff4bf5565ad436ebff81fb0e4e06f07"> BOGOTÁ – Latin America has come to the end of its <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/latin-america-slow-economic-recovery-raises-lost-decade-worries-by-jose-antonio-ocampo-2021-12">second lost decade</a> of development. Average annual <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=ZJ">growth</a> hovered just below 0.9% for the 2014-23 period – worse than the 1.3% rate in the 1980s. GDP per capita, however, is projected to be <a href="https://repositorio.cepal.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/50120204-0eb0-46fd-af2b-99e3de70f5e7/content">slightly higher</a> in 2023 than in 2013, owing to slower population growth. By contrast, it was not until 1994 that the region’s GDP per capita returned to its 1980 level. Still, Latin America has a severe growth problem. </p><p data-line-id="0caf7eaedbb64a1a92fc3cf953718324"> To be sure, economic performance has varied across countries. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) <a href="https://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/economic-activity-latin-america-and-caribbean-continues-exhibit-low-growth-trajectory">estimates</a> that Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean outperformed South America in 2023. Among the largest economies, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia fared better than Chile and Peru, which recorded zero growth, while Argentina’s ailing economy contracted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/imf-sees-drought-causing-argentina-contraction-25-2023-2023-07-25/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20July%2025%20(Reuters),that%20has%20curtailed%20agricultural%20production.">2.5%</a>. Venezuela grew by <a href="https://en.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/news/economy/Venezuela-grew-by-2023-4-in-5-as-predicted-by-ECLAC/">4.5%</a>, but its GDP remains less than a third of its size a decade ago. </p><p data-line-id="3625d95e0b4c437aba3464c4bb5b555d"> Although foreign direct investment has remained robust, private external financing has been limited, and borrowing costs have increased. While bond issuance in Latin America and the Caribbean <a href="https://www.cepal.org/sites/default/files/news/files/s2301213_en.pdf">grew by 30%</a> in the first ten months of 2023, it was still roughly half of the annual average between 2019 and 2021. Moreover, the average yield of Latin American bonds is currently around 8%, compared to roughly 5% in 2021, despite a modest decline in risk margins. The primary driver of this increase has been the higher yield on ten-year US Treasuries. </p>

<p data-line-id="9c0f2d235f844affafc4f19c6cc9fdfd"> SHANGHAI – The narrative that China’s economy is nearing its peak – or has already reached it – has taken hold in Western media. But if you read the doomsayers’ analyses carefully, you will find that many of the reasons they give for their bleak assessments are not new. On the contrary, they tend to highlight precisely the same challenges that economists and commentators have been harping on for at least a decade or longer. If China was not sputtering then, why should we believe it is now? </p><p data-line-id="83fd7c9fb0bd4713ba5bd4c6fe98d72f"> To be sure, the global context has changed. Perhaps most important, the prevailing narrative about China has turned largely negative, and the West is now far more hostile toward it than it was ten or even five years ago. With the United States working harder than ever to contain China, direct Chinese exports to the US have <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/06/china-share-us-imports-falls-to-lowest-since-2006/#:~:text=Donald%20Trump's%20trade%20war%20and,lowest%20level%20in%2017%20years&amp;text=Imports%20of%20China%2Dmade%20products%20has%20dropped%20sharply.&amp;text=China's%20share%20of%20US%20goods,by%20the%20US%20Census%20Bureau.">fallen</a>. </p><p data-line-id="7698fbb15a2c4ae68f3db17f7980dca2"> Even so, the “decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies is probably overstated. A <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/us-china-decoupling-rhetoric-and-reality">recent study</a> by University of California San Diego economist Caroline Freund and her colleagues shows that the US and China are indeed reducing their engagement in some areas. For example, US import growth from China lagged well behind US import growth from other countries for products subject to US tariffs. </p>

<p data-line-id="9d81a0d11d2f4f86950e1d8d93c16159"> CAMBRIDGE – The global economy was full of surprises in 2023. Despite the sharp rise in interest rates, the United States successfully avoided a recession, and major emerging markets did not spiral into a debt crisis. Even Japan’s geriatric economy exhibited stunning vitality. By contrast, the European Union fell behind, as its German growth engine sputtered after China’s four-decade era of hypergrowth abruptly ended. </p><p data-line-id="b23e5eed7a444c59baa245b180d20bf3"> Looking ahead to 2024, several questions loom large. What will happen to long-term inflation-adjusted interest rates? Can China avoid a more dramatic slowdown, given the turmoil in its real-estate sector and high levels of local-government debt? Having maintained near-zero interest rates for two decades, can the Bank of Japan (BOJ) normalize rates without triggering systemic financial and debt crises? Will the delayed effects of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes eventually push the US into a recession? Can emerging markets maintain stability for another year? Lastly, what will be the next major source of geopolitical instability? Will it be a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, former President Donald Trump winning November’s US presidential election, or an unforeseen event? </p><p data-line-id="cfc7e0f14ee742be84b4243487aff9ee"> The answers to these questions are interconnected. A recession in the US could lead to a significant decrease in global interest rates, but this may provide only temporary relief. After all, several factors, including extraordinarily high debt levels, creeping deglobalization, rising populism, the need to increase defense spending, and the green transition, will likely keep long-term rates well above the ultra-low levels of 2012-21 for the next decade. </p>

<p data-line-id="58a1cdac287549558e1a6a9a6f2bf114"> BOSTON – Debates about inequality trends in the United States have leapt from the pages of academic journals to leading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/business/economy/economy-republicans-inequality.html">media outlets</a>. While <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538167380/The-Myth-of-American-Inequality-How-Government-Biases-Policy-Debate">conservatives</a> have long questioned whether US inequality has really increased, <em>The </em><em>Economist </em>recently weighed in, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/30/income-gaps-are-growing-inexorably-arent-they">concluding</a> that “the idea that inequality is rising is very far from a self-evident truth.” Unfortunately, this debate has muddled several issues in an unhelpful manner. </p><p data-line-id="2da06bcee092409c9d75b41a6fb132b7"> There are different notions of inequality, each of which is relevant to a different question and complicated by its own unique measurement challenges. The most straightforward metric is labor-income inequality, which refers to what high earners receive relative to low earners. When we talk about how workers with college degrees are faring compared to those with just a high-school diploma, we are also talking about labor-income inequality. </p><p data-line-id="8832c67c3b3c472abd3d0114741612ba"> Of course, measuring labor income is not a simple matter, because some earnings go unreported, and some very highly paid individuals deploy strategies to make their labor income look like capital income (which is taxed at a lower rate). Moreover, when it comes to determining if real (inflation-adjusted) wages have increased, there is a vigorous debate about whether the consumer price index is overstating true inflation. But even after accounting for these issues, there is no doubt that labor-income inequality <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Skills%2C%20Tasks%20and%20Technologies%20-%20Implications%20for%20.pdf">has surged</a> at least since 1980, and that the trend has <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Autor_2019_Work%20of%20the%20Past%2C%20Work%20of%20the%20FutureAEA.pdf">continued</a> since the post-2008 Great Recession. </p>

<p data-line-id="12c3be178d5443d0ab78f10ff074dbfc"> LONDON – What does it take to change a person’s mind? As generative artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in customer-facing systems – think of human-like phone calls or online chatbots – it is an ethical question that needs to be addressed widely. </p><p data-line-id="c624309c827f4fe6a15af0184359c91e"> The capacity to change minds through reasoned discourse is at the heart of democracy. Clear and effective communication forms the foundation of deliberation and persuasion, which are essential to resolve competing interests. But there is a dark side to persuasion: false motives, lies, and cognitive manipulation – malicious behavior that AI could facilitate. </p><p data-line-id="d897e9a5ad9b4d0f8717ba7d31e5dd7a"> In the not-so-distant future, generative AI could enable the creation of new user interfaces that can persuade on behalf of any person or entity with the means to establish such a system. Leveraging private knowledge bases, these specialized models would offer different truths that compete based on their ability to generate convincing responses for a target group – an AI for each ideology. A wave of AI-assisted social engineering would surely follow, with escalating competition making it easier and cheaper for bad actors to spread disinformation and perpetrate scams. </p>

<p data-line-id="2e7e62f510e64966baed445477f30860"> NEW YORK – In my old job at the US State Department, colleagues often asked me what was likely to happen in this or that situation. Often, there was no way of knowing, and I reminded questioners that I was Director of Policy Planning, not of predicting. That said, prediction can be a useful intellectual exercise that serves us well in the coming year. </p><p data-line-id="467b966cd16440b7b78dfb67fc23bdfb"> The US presidential election in November is almost certain to be 2024’s most significant event. To be sure, US elections are always consequential given America’s power and influence. But what makes this election fundamentally different is that it is likely to be one in which the differences between the major party candidates far outweigh their similarities. Assuming President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump gain their respective parties’ nominations, who wins will matter a great deal, both to the United States and to the world. </p><p data-line-id="86cbe1f54b474e628c98b321ab0f61d0"> To be sure, there are some similarities between Biden and Trump. Neither believes in free trade, although Trump, unlike Biden, is an outright protectionist. Both favor a bigger role for government in the economy. Both wanted to exit Afghanistan. They also agree on the need to take a tough line toward China, especially when it comes to trade and investment in critical technologies. </p>

<p data-line-id="be3a56ac3dcd4683a4465625cd4dfa30"> CAMBRIDGE – The Pulitzer-nominated play <a href="https://playbill.com/production/other-desert-cities-booth-theatre-vault-0000013753"><em>Other Desert Cities</em></a>, set in Palm Springs, California, tells a tale about a fractured family’s struggles to establish dialogue across political divides. More than a decade after the play premiered in 2011, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (<a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/">COP28</a>), held in another desert city, offered a macrocosmic telling of the same story. </p>
<p data-line-id="29d87de725a44201a1d6d591cfcf87e2"> The real-life version, set in Dubai, was also rife with conflict, and the stakes were as high as ever. Many objected to the fact that such a crucial summit would be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/27/cop28-climate-summit-dubai/">hosted</a> by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. Adding insult to injury, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/07/meet-the-oil-man-tasked-with-saving-the-planet-cop28">master of ceremonies</a> was none other than the president of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sultan-al-jaber">Sultan Al Jaber</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="74a539d4b9394e7f88bde50a346255f9"> At one point during the conference, the UAE was reported to be striking new <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67508331">oil and gas deals</a> on the sidelines, calling into question its motivation for hosting the event. Then, Al Jaber reportedly claimed that there is “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/03/back-into-caves-cop28-president-dismisses-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels">no science</a>” to show that phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to achieve the Paris climate agreement’s 1.5° Celsius warming target. None of these revelations boded well for a summit whose agenda included the first “<a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake/about-the-global-stocktake/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-global-stocktake">global stocktake</a>”: an international audit, prescribed by the Paris agreement, to determine whether countries are on track to achieve their emissions-reduction targets. </p>
<p data-line-id="fc5f04b612ce45dca7c500bfc3d67865"> But two arduous weeks of negotiations ended with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/13/cop28-landmark-deal-agreed-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels">praise</a> for Al Jaber and a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html">sweeping agreement</a>” that explicitly mentions “fossil fuels” for the first time ever. Though largely rhetorical, such language represents a breakthrough that was almost 30 years in the making. All previous agreements had avoided naming names or directly acknowledging the predominant role that fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) play in causing climate change. Even better, this COP also made progress on other fronts, such as by committing countries to triple their renewable-energy capacity and radically reduce their emissions of methane, an especially potent (albeit shorter-lasting) greenhouse gas, as well some headway on the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/climate-disaster-fund-approved-at-uns-cop28-climate-summit">loss and damage</a> fund for developing countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="6e51a83405c847d3a8a19a4a48d82ab5"> What explains the change in the story? Perhaps it was the host country going off script. After <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/cop28-in-murky-middle-ground-on-climate-goals-after-1st-week-wraps-up">negotiations apparently stalled</a>, Al Jaber ultimately saved face by announcing an intervention <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/cop28-al-jaber-tries-to-break-deadlock-with-circular-meeting">less than 48 hours</a> before the scheduled end of the summit. </p>
<p data-line-id="c8695a56bd2b45cfbe6c7f0ed04b5208"> Specifically, he called for a <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a36423416/arab-majlis/"><em>majlis</em></a> (“place of sitting”), a longstanding Arab tradition of fostering constructive dialogue by removing distractions and engaging with one another directly. While the structure can vary widely – from informal tête-à-tête and intellectual exchanges to quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative conferences – the key function is to blur the line between sociability and business. As an important feature of social and political life across much of the Islamic world, the practice has been designated by UNESCO as a “<a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/majlis-a-cultural-and-social-space-01076">intangible cultural heritage of humanity</a>.” </p>
<p data-line-id="b21505b153444f6e9604cd7546a103a1"> Far from some cultural gimmick, Al Jaber’s innovative revision to the COP process seems to have been the key to breaking the deadlock. In traditional <em>majlis</em> fashion, delegates broke form by sitting in concentric circles, signaling the absence of a leader in the conversation. All were <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/as-cop28-talks-wind-down-sticking-points-remain-on-fossil-fuels-and-climate-adaptation">encouraged</a> to embrace the spirit of flexibility and compromise, which meant abandoning their well-rehearsed “talking points.” </p>
<p data-line-id="fab8d40979d34879aa575cc69952a26b"> These tweaks fundamentally <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/as-cop28-talks-wind-down-sticking-points-remain-on-fossil-fuels-and-climate-adaptation">changed</a> the tone of the negotiations. Participants later attested to the success of the <em>majlis</em> in fostering “frank and deep discussions” and a “heart-to-heart exchange.” A typically sterile and highly formal forum acquired shades of the <em>bayt al she’r</em>, the goat-hair tents used by nomadic Bedouin, who know as well as anyone that the more treacherous the climate becomes, the more important it is to create fora for building inter-tribal trust. </p>
<p data-line-id="375638e006364e878db2a32a2f3d64be"> To be sure, there has been growing skepticism about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/nations-miss-paris-targets-climate-driven-weather-events-cost-billions">the efficacy</a> of the unanimity-focused Paris agreement more broadly, and the initial reactions to COP28 have been similarly ambivalent. But, as I argued in a <a href="https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/cilj/12/1/article-p24.xml">paper</a> published earlier this year, consensus-building – what the <em>majlis</em> achieved – remains a superior option to coercion. The Paris agreement may break the mold of international covenants, but its approach is supported by a growing body of theory – from <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/elinor-ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a>’s groundbreaking look at “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/A8BB63BC4A1433A50A3FB92EDBBB97D5">governing the commons</a>” to Oliver Hart’s work on “<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/09/a-new-approach-to-contracts">relational contracts</a>.” The reason, as Tom Tyler’s <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691158006/why-people-cooperate#:~:text=In%20Why%20People%20Cooperate%2C%20Tom,connections%20rather%20than%20material%20interests.">research</a> on the psychology of compliance shows, is that intrinsic motivation is often more compelling than external threats. </p>
<p data-line-id="d1fc5cdae5f641a4b2a5667bab07b8c6"> As unexpected as it was, the COP28 outcome could be a notable successor to COP21, where the Paris climate agreement was concluded. With his inspired adaptation of the <em>majlis</em>, Al Jaber represented his country and culture well and, by demonstrating the procedural wisdom of Eastern cultural practices (often neglected in global talks) and acknowledging the role of emotion in international diplomacy, shook up international climate governance. Such shifts in the culture of climate governance are sorely needed to ensure that the Global South remains front and center, not just as a recipient of handouts but as a <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Epistemologies-of-the-South-Justice-Against-Epistemicide/Santos/p/book/9781612055459">repository of epistemic wisdom</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="46a3798fd0cb43068d1ee44d2e989b34"> Of course, COP28 was far from perfect. The wording about fossil fuels may have been unprecedented, but it was also greatly <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20231211-un-climate-chief-urges-countries-to-lift-tactical-blockades-to-reach-deal-on-fossil-fuels-at-cop28">watered down</a>, and the final agreement was deeply disappointing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/20/not-conducive-to-our-survival-pacific-islands-on-the-climate-frontline-respond-to-cop28-deal">small island states</a> and advocates hoping for stronger concrete commitments on <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/12/13/cop28-a-disappointing-outcome-on-the-crucial-issue-of-adaptation-to-climate-change_6339319_114.html">climate finance</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="3abbf8c280da446e9fc9d89a1bda4966"> But like <em>Other Desert Cities</em>, the summit may have turned out to be a masterclass in the art of communication – and the unlikely tale of redemption that we need after this climate-ravaged, overheated, war-torn year. The lesson from Dubai is that trust-building institutional breakthroughs are just as important as the scientific and technological kind, and not only for climate governance. </p>

<p data-line-id="40cf69fd565c43ac89a436cb9ecb1b78"> WASHINGTON, DC/CAMBRIDGE – Democracies around the world face two major threats: a crisis of legitimacy, and increasingly aggressive authoritarian regimes. What links both and makes them much more dangerous is the pernicious effect of dark-money transfers, particularly those that pass through <a href="https://cthi.taxjustice.net/en/">offshore tax havens</a> and <a href="https://fsi.taxjustice.net/">jurisdictions with excessive financial secrecy</a>. Restricting these tax havens and requiring more transparency on cross-border financial flows should become a major policy priority for all G7 countries in 2024. </p><p data-line-id="1af2d4bce61740ceb63ca1b39ffbc2c1"> The internal threat to democracy is an erosion of legitimacy. In industrial economies such as the United States and Europe, new technologies, rising cross-border capital flows, and lower barriers to trade increased average productivity and created economic growth over the last half-century, but the benefits of this growth were not widely shared. Inequality within these countries has <a href="https://shapingwork.mit.edu/power-and-progress/">increased dramatically</a> since the mid-1970s, with millions of people now feeling they have been left behind. </p><p data-line-id="219cf1b0da544476ba0bfa15fc433dca"> Support for democracy is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/29/many-across-the-globe-are-dissatisfied-with-how-democracy-is-working/">undermined</a> by the belief that the economic game is “rigged,” with people who are already powerful and privileged gaining the most – sometimes at the expense of the rest. While this belief may be exaggerated, it accords with the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon">reality of tax evasion</a>. </p>

<p data-line-id="e1246d19b04a4bec8453a96a80dcd7ac"> LONDON – It may shock some Americans to learn that democratic leaders and publics in Europe and elsewhere are more concerned about the prospect of Donald Trump winning their country’s 2024 presidential election than any other world event, including crucial elections in their own countries. </p><p data-line-id="6973a70c9c1048228328c8678acb202d"> To be sure, there is no shortage of global threats.

The United States’ unwavering support for Israel’s forceful response to the October 7 massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas evokes the “<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-gives-austria-hungary-blank-check-assurance">blank check</a>” that German Kaiser Wilhelm II offered to Austria-Hungary in dealing with Serbia, which set the stage for World War I. Israel’s American allies might want to reflect on the outcomes of that war – which resulted in 40 million deaths and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian empires – and reconsider what true friendship means in such situations. </p>

<p data-line-id="f1099dce8b514419aeb4169b4e97de53"> PRINCETON – The year 2023 ended on a sour, cheerless note, with looming elections in 2024 intensifying fears about the fate of democracy and the global order. In addition to the Russian presidential “election” in March, there will be European Parliament elections in June, the US presidential and congressional elections in November, and a general election in the United Kingdom sometime before January 2025. Between the assured re-election of Russia’s autocrat and the possibility of a populist wave on both sides of the Atlantic, there is plenty of reason to worry about the future of democracy. </p><p data-line-id="06d0e83fa0f4403a880cd2bba0009358"> Of course, populists don’t always win elections, and even if they form the largest party in parliament – as in Poland and the Netherlands this past fall – that doesn’t necessarily mean they will control the government. The scenario that is really keeping people up at night is the fact that Donald Trump has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/politics/biden-trump-2024-poll.html">leading</a> US President Joe Biden in polls in states that Biden must win. But a Trump victory also may be less likely than both Trumpists and anti-Trumpians believe. </p><p data-line-id="6ee69f30d557406a921288de2ddd7bdb"> Such polls – taken a year ahead of the election – tend to stimulate angst and add to the sense of Trumpian momentum. But if we take a step back, we may find that the picture is more complicated. The current political dynamic in the US is unfolding along the lines of a game of chicken – a classic proposition in game theory. The template comes from James Dean’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtEp7zFdrc">Chicken Run</a>” in the movie <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, where two gang leaders race stolen cars toward a cliff to see who veers away from danger first. American democracy, and the world, is being subjected to the same terrifying experience. </p>

<p data-line-id="6bbd63534de54cf0a484054b946d7e45"> AUSTIN – When assessments of the <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/the-quasi-inflation-of-2021-2022-a-case-of-bad-analysis-and-worse-response">quasi-inflation of 2021-22</a> appeared in major US media outlets this month, the prognosis was good: the fever has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/business/inflation-federal-reserve-economy.html">receded</a> and may already be gone. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/what-to-watch-in-fridays-spending-report-inflation-closing-in-on-feds-target-0778037d">latest reports</a> on personal consumption expenditures were jubilant. If trends continue, “such a success would be likely to shape [US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s] legacy,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/business/economy/jerome-powell-soft-landing.html">noted</a> Jeanna Smialek of <em>The New York Times</em>. </p><p data-line-id="d80e23d1232d4853b686969e51863426"> Smialek’s article illustrates the fetish of Fed worship. The two economists she quotes, a former Fed official and a banker, are resolute in crediting Powell and his colleagues. “The Fed right now looks pretty dang good,” says one. “Certainly they’ve done very well,” says the other. Still, some readers may harbor doubts, because, as Smialek notes, we have “an outcome that [the Fed’s] own staff economists viewed as unlikely just six months ago.” </p><p data-line-id="ceb64bd17d2640bba92f036f4e994d34"> What should we make of this? Supposedly, the Fed’s actions “played a role in … keeping consumers from adjusting their expectations.” Yet <em>none</em> of the experts, including the professionals who guide policy, shared the inflation optimism now attributed to the consuming masses or even detected its presence. With all their surveys and all their models, they were surprised. </p>

<p data-line-id="6a7892d74939442486be0f44896b4b1b"> The process of extracting critical minerals from raw ore – before smelting, refining, or otherwise changing them into usable forms – is highly concentrated within global supply chains, and not in Europe. In 2021, China processed 50% of the world’s <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/chart-countries-produce-lithium-world/">lithium</a>, 56% of its <a href="https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/2023-12/e-paper_value-addition-in-the-context-of-mineral-processing_endf2.pdf">nickel</a>, 80% of its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/21/economy/china-chip-material-exports-drop-intl-hnk/index.html">gallium</a>, 60% of its germanium, and 69% of its <a href="https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/2023-12/e-paper_value-addition-in-the-context-of-mineral-processing_endf2.pdf">cobalt</a>. As a result, these supply chains are prone to bottlenecks and highly vulnerable to economic and geopolitical shocks. </p>
<p data-line-id="03174a96158e42dca40dba424119308b"> If a mineral-processing power like China decides to use critical-mineral supplies as leverage or punishment, the EU will be at a significant disadvantage. In July, China announced it would <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierBlas/status/1675872776568164355">restrict exports</a> of gallium and germanium, both of which are needed to manufacture semiconductors. That decision had ramifications for national security in Europe, where demand for gallium is <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:903d35cc-c4a2-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF#:~:text=EU%20demand%20for%20gallium%2C%20used,expected%20to%20reverse%20the%20trend.">expected to grow 17-fold</a> by 2050. </p>
<p data-line-id="04d7fd929c7841f3a9f0412f3d47efe3"> This vulnerability partly explains why the European Commission is committed to getting the <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/publications/european-critical-raw-materials-act_en">Critical Raw Materials Act</a> passed by early 2024. Along with strengthening the EU’s own mineral-processing capacity and forging “strategic partnerships” with mineral-rich countries, the CRMA is a key component of the EU’s strategy for securing the supplies it needs. </p>
<p data-line-id="aa741b60803b4422b586e74c9ae235f9"> To boost the appeal of strategic partnerships – while distancing itself from its <a href="https://ehne.fr/en/encyclopedia/themes/ecology-and-environment-in-europe/mobilizing-energies/extractivism-and-environment-in-europe-sixteenth%E2%80%93twenty-first-century">extractivist past</a> – the EU has incorporated into the CRMA commitments to “value-addition” in the countries where critical raw minerals will be mined and processed. While we can guess some of what is meant by that – for example, supporting the development of mineral-processing capacity in countries where it is lacking – neither the CRMA nor any other documentation published so far clearly defines how value-added would be measured. </p>
<p data-line-id="4bd2b172edc44c2cbb76e00cd9096a52"> As a <a href="https://www.boell.de/en/2023/11/15/value-addition-context-mineral-processing">new study</a> by the Heinrich Böll Foundation points out, this leaves citizens of mineral-producing countries, as well as Europeans, unable to make informed decisions about these strategic partnerships, which are, in any case, legally non-binding. As one expert interviewed in the study observes, “unless it is clearly defined, value-added becomes a political slogan that can be wielded. For it to mean anything in practice, it is a concept that needs to be unpacked.” </p>
<p data-line-id="637bd0f8559c417baacb84dd0534ba18"> The European Commission has offered some clues as to what such “unpacking” would reveal. During last month’s EU <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/week_en">Raw Materials Week</a> in Brussels, public statements by Commission representatives suggested that value-addition would be economic in nature, with a focus on creating jobs and generating revenues for local communities. But while jobs and revenues are obviously desirable, this approach fails to account for the vast environmental and social costs of mineral processing. </p>
<p data-line-id="d13b82278f6246578bd176f01de2688e"> In Namibia, a major copper-smelting operation in Tsumeb has, in the past, <a href="https://mme.gov.na/files/publications/85e_GSN%20Comms%2019.%201.%20Hasheela_land%20use%20Tsumeb.pdf">contaminated</a> the local air, soil, and water, to the point that residents showed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883292715300111">elevated levels</a> of lead and arsenic. In Chile, <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/lithium-triangle/#:~:text=In%20Chile's%20Salar%20de%20Atacama,grow%20crops%20and%20maintain%20livestock.">lithium extraction</a> has caused severe water shortages, as it consumes 65% of the Atacama Desert region’s supply and contaminates freshwater sources. Local communities have <a href="https://www.dw.com/es/chile-explotaci%C3%B3n-de-litio-deja-sin-agua-a-pobladores/a-52165228">barely been consulted</a>, if at all, about these activities – a violation of the principles enshrined in International Labor Organization <a href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C169">Convention 169</a> and the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="f6c367ec8c024de58ede5adfd4ef1907"> If you poison the local people in order to create jobs for them, can those jobs really be considered “value-added”? What about the mineral revenues that were made possible by the destruction of local ecosystems? Does the local economy truly benefit from activities that drain it of vital ecological and social resources? </p>
<p data-line-id="67f19d7a7e17445c9d57c8e353bf3d82"> It should be obvious that short-term economic gains generated by mineral extraction and processing mean little if they have devastating environmental and health effects (which of course carry longer-term economic costs). That is why the European Commission must incorporate environmental and social considerations into assessments of value-addition linked to the CRMA and similar initiatives. </p>
<p data-line-id="48c4e539e0d84a1db94d5408678c9871"> But that is just the beginning. Even in strictly economic terms, the concept of value-addition demands a more nuanced perspective. A <a href="https://www.aeer.or.id/2023/09/23/perusahaan-perusahaan-multinasional-dan-hilirisasi-nikel-di-indonesia/">recent report</a> calculated that more than 95% of GDP generated by increased nickel-processing in one of Indonesia’s two key nickel-producing regions, Morowali, did not remain there. So, local communities are not only bearing the massive <a href="https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022.07.25_Letter-to-Tesla-re-nickel-mining_WALHI.pdf">environmental costs</a> of nickel extraction; they are gaining almost nothing from the revenues. None of this should be considered “value-added” by the EU. </p>
<p data-line-id="b4ac4e399d0b43fca0ce40f92a71668b"> And then there is best practice. Mineral processing, as a sector, is relatively under-scrutinized compared to, say, mining. Experts consider “green” refining – if such a thing can exist – an emerging field, at best. And, so far, advances in mineral processing have been focused mostly on mitigating financial and geopolitical risks for firms, rather than improving social and environmental outcomes. </p>
<p data-line-id="378249740fdd4930a52302a8ce765047"> To be sure, the electric vehicle-maker Tesla <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/elon-musk-breaks-ground-on-tesla-lithium-refinery-in-texas.html">claims</a> to have devised an “innovative” lithium-processing technique that is “designed to consume less hazardous reagents” than the conventional process and create “usable” byproducts. “You could live right in the middle of the refinery and not suffer any ill effects,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasts. But the firm has not provided any details publicly. The Heinrich Böll Foundation reached out to Tesla requesting more information, but received no response. </p>
<p data-line-id="1c89ecda4bbf4c799cf3db7c6ec49c97"> Left unreformed, mineral processing may add some economic value for some countries in some cases, but at great social and environmental cost. Unless the EU looks beyond narrowly economic metrics, its investments in this area will merely perpetuate the wrongs of the current fossil-fuel-based system, damaging human health, destroying ecosystems, and exacerbating the “decarbonization divide.” No amount of rhetoric about “adding value” will change that. </p>

<p data-line-id="0b4ba95b827f41f2938c7d24596d6824"> CAMBRIDGE – Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election in 2016, many pundits predicted a worldwide breakdown of democracy, and some warned of civil war. But, aside from Africa’s Sahel region, military coups remain rare, and civil wars rarer still. Instead, democracies have tended to break down through civilian coups. </p><p data-line-id="7b9082b5bbf447bea5a595c25930b57b"> Such coups have been of three types in the post-Cold War era. Two have attracted much media attention; the one that should worry us the most, especially given the specter of Trump’s return to power in early 2025, has not. </p><p data-line-id="c10b732c220d481ba63f2123fa1a2e06"> The first model of democratic retreat is exemplified by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Having passed a draconian <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/01/07/hungary-media-law-endangers-press-freedom">media law</a> after returning to power in 2010, Orbán and his political party, Fidesz, have used every major outlet to manipulate fear of immigrants and LGBT activists and to portray the prime minister as a national savior. Orbán also exploits regional tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, to <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-ukraine-membership-agreement-required-sacrificing-rule-of-law-in-hungary-by-jan-werner-mueller-2023-12">squeeze sponsors</a> – both Russia and the European Union – for resources to fund lavish social spending. </p>

<p data-line-id="e0b7762c1f914367a146c8b9f586e656">Every December, <em>Project Syndicate </em>commentators identify the issues and trends to watch in the coming 12 months. Although the world has largely moved on from COVID-19, it is still dealing with the ramifications of Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as new wars, conflicts, and revisionist misadventures from the Middle East and the Sahel to Latin America and the South China Sea. In this year’s selection, commentators stress the role that democratic elections will play in resolving these and other issues, and in ensuring a long-term future for democracy itself.<br/></p><p data-line-id="bd0eb2614c22452db18829c7563f0a19"><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/adekeye-adebajo"><strong>ADEKEYE ADEBAJO</strong></a></p><p data-line-id="836b7f66261a4c5d883f872688849482"> Africa will be forced to focus disproportionately on challenges stemming from coups, conflicts, and climate change. With the return of military brass hats in West Africa, democratic governance will remain under siege, and Nigeria, an insecurity-plagued Gulliver, will struggle to impose order on its own northeast as well as on Lilliputians across the drought-stricken Sahel. The Horn of Africa will remain threatened by widespread displacement, drought, famine, and warlordism. Militias in eastern Congo and the Central African Republic will continue to drive massive population displacement, and flood-stricken Southern Africa’s dominant liberation parties – not least South Africa’s African National Congress – will stubbornly cling to power. </p>

<p data-line-id="4ecaf2a1a6c645029d3891e13a2fcaaf"> BERKELEY – While this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai was mainly focused on the heated debate between countries about the future of fossil fuels, a delegation from the US state of California, headed by Governor Gavin Newsom, was hard at work advancing climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="b9e2387ee5734635bee68d01b800edbc"> In addition to <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/california-launches-methane-cutting-effort-subnational-governments-cop28">launching</a> a coalition of subnational governments committed to reducing methane, California was <a href="https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/790041-historic-new-mediterranean-climate-action-partnership-sets-global-stage">one of 14 governments</a> representing regions with a Mediterranean climate to establish a <a href="https://www.medclimate.org/">partnership</a> aimed at strengthening resilience against extreme heat, droughts, and fires. The state also <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-12/california-joins-global-offshore-wind-alliance-ambitious-commitment">joined</a> an alliance whose members are committed to building 380 gigawatts of combined offshore wind capacity by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="90a3e0fcd5b54ed5ae2ebd644d5ac199"> California’s <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/12/07/what-california-accomplished-at-cop28/">commitments</a> made at COP28 come on top of climate-change and clean-energy memorandums of understanding that California recently <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/about/campaigns/international-cooperation/climate-change-partnerships">signed</a> with China (with which the United States must <a href="https://www.robertstavinsblog.org/2023/12/15/what-really-happened-at-cop-28-in-dubai/">cooperate more closely</a> on global action to combat climate change), Canada, Mexico, Australia, and other countries. Moreover, this flurry of activity is only the most recent example of the state’s efforts to develop climate solutions. California’s long-term commitment to the green transition has highlighted the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cities-subnational-governments-model-solutions-for-national-and-international-leaders-by-michael-r-bloomberg-and-yvonne-aki-sawyerr-2023-12">power of subnational governments</a> to accelerate progress toward net-zero emissions. </p>
<p data-line-id="166878f1036f42d9967798efb0a16c7d"> This year marked the tenth anniversary of California’s groundbreaking cap-and-trade system, which covers about <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fact-Sheet-Cap-and-Trade.pdf">85%</a> of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in the state. By setting a strict cap on allowable carbon pollution, lowering it annually, and distributing tradable credits accordingly, the program has created certainty for the business community. </p>
<p data-line-id="830751f283854e3589e0862ff4d894de"> Setting a limit and a price on emissions has had significant <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works">environmental and economic benefits</a>. In the decade since the program’s implementation, GHG emissions have fallen by <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4811">14%</a> (although other complementary state policies have also contributed to this decline). The Canadian province of Québec <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/program-linkage">linked</a> its own cap-and-trade program to California’s system in 2014, and Washington State <a href="https://www.edf.org/media/washington-state-releases-landmark-decision-move-toward-linking-california-quebec-carbon">plans</a> to join them, creating an even larger transnational carbon market. </p>
<p data-line-id="6576cc176f38429db443e2c80af8ae9f"> Cap-and-trade systems, as well as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and net-zero commitments, depend on the monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon dioxide emissions. California is also forging ahead on this front. In September, Newsom <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2023/09/california-corporate-climate-impacts-bill/">signed</a> two bills that require companies to disclose their GHG emissions and their climate-related financial risks – the first legislation of its kind in the US. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed but not enacted similar rules. </p>
<p data-line-id="265f38c7a3b54a9f9b7799f676efce6d"> Combating climate change requires setting ambitious renewable-energy targets and devising major emissions-reduction initiatives, both of which California has done. The state aims to achieve <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1985611/is-california-still-on-track-to-meet-its-goal-of-100-clean-power-by-2045">100% clean electricity</a> by 2045 and, under its <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/rps/">Renewable Portfolio Standard</a>, will require utilities to obtain 60% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. California has also invested heavily in large-scale solar plants, such as <a href="https://www.bherenewables.com/projects/solar#:~:text=Topaz%20Solar%20Farms%20is%20a,solar%20projects%20in%20the%20world.">Topaz Solar Farm</a>, one of the largest single solar projects in the world.  </p>
<p data-line-id="5ad0eefe886e41bf9f200a4cccb5539a"> Moreover, California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle program, which reached its goal of 1.5 million in-state sales of ZEVs <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/04/21/california-surpasses-1-5-million-zevs-goal-two-years-ahead-of-schedule/">two years ahead of schedule</a>, has <a href="https://www.qad.com/blog/2021/02/the-global-impact-of-zev-mandates-on-the-u-s-auto-industry">led automakers</a> to move away from the internal combustion engine and spurred the adoption of electric vehicles nationwide. More recently, Newsom <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/sites/default/files/2020-11/Building%20back%20greener%20-%20California.pdf">announced</a> new ambitious targets for the program, including that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state are ZEVs by 2035. </p>
<p data-line-id="67b29a7ef8734063bfeaed4e989f5f8d"> Being at the forefront of tackling climate change is nothing new for California, which has a long history of setting energy-usage standards, from appliances to building codes, for the country. It was the first state to implement <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/history-and-impacts">minimum energy-efficiency standards</a> in 1974 – years before federal regulations were adopted – and to establish an energy regulation commission. This is partly why California has one of the lowest <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=CA">per capita energy consumption rates</a> in the US. In fact, if the rest of the country had kept pace with California in reducing fossil-fuel use, GHG emissions would be almost <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/31/18646906/climate-change-california-energy-efficiency">25% lower</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="c857a62e987741e48a10f91c01e20399"> As a center of innovation, California has played a vital role in shaping national research-and-development policies. Reflecting its formidable R&amp;D capabilities in its world class public and private universities and national labs, the state was recently selected as a hydrogen hub. As a result, it will receive <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/10/13/california-selected-as-a-national-hydrogen-hub/">$1.2 billion</a> from the federal government to accelerate the development and deployment of green hydrogen, a potentially transformative clean fuel that could help decarbonize heavy industry and transport and improve domestic energy production. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0fc39caf9704f3dbbc1228f708f8d90"> Silicon Valley has been instrumental to California’s innovation and forward-thinking approach, while also influencing its regulatory climate. The state has enacted legislation and rules to address emerging tech issues, from data privacy to autonomous vehicles. For example, the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> is one of the most comprehensive laws of its kind in the US, granting individuals greater control over their personal data. The state has also worked to ensure that the tech sector serves the public interest, including by <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-files-lawsuit-against-meta-over-harms-youth-mental-health">suing Meta</a> for harming children’s mental health. </p>
<p data-line-id="2f147c5c61664fce9fc27c6664d0b5a3"> Consider, for example, generative artificial intelligence. Newsom recently issued an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AI-EO-No.12-_-GGN-Signed.pdf">executive order</a> recognizing that the state, home to 35 of the world’s top 50 AI companies, has a unique responsibility to promote innovation and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/california-charts-the-future-of-ai/">develop</a> responsible policies and regulations. Given the potential for AI to be a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/ai-climate-change-what-role-paris-targets-2023-09">key tool</a> in the fight against climate change, California is wise to identify and promote its beneficial uses. </p>
<p data-line-id="14176b61fb034cb2b3f99522d5a81723"> Far too many Americans <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-ballot-initiatives-progressive-federalism-overcome-congress-gridlock-and-obstruction-by-laura-tyson-and-lenny-mendonca-2023-02?barrier=accesspaylog">have grown accustomed</a> to government dysfunction and Congress’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/us/politics/government-dysfunction-normal.html">inability to pass legislation</a>. Nevertheless, when national – or even international – efforts to limit global warming fall short, subnational governments, especially <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/07/20/california-is-model-for-climate-change-action-when-international-efforts-fall-short-pub-90245">the state of California</a>, are making meaningful progress both within and beyond their borders. </p>

<p data-line-id="425e3989519c40439a23e1e0527098fa"> OXFORD – More than 70 national elections are scheduled for 2024, including in eight of the ten most populous countries. But one group is likely to be significantly underrepresented: women. A major reason is the disproportionate amount of abuse female politicians and candidates receive online, including threats of rape and violence, and the rise of artificial intelligence, which can be used to create sexually explicit deepfakes, is only compounding the problem. </p><p data-line-id="52df19ea3f4b4cb1b7926853342b330c"> And yet, over the past year, platforms such as Meta, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube have de-emphasized content moderation and rolled back policies that previously kept hate, harassment, and lies in check. According to a <a href="https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/2023-12/big_tech_backslide_free_press_report_final.pdf">new report</a>, this has fueled a “toxic online environment that is vulnerable to exploitation from anti-democracy forces, white supremacists, and other bad actors.” </p><p data-line-id="061e4f55ad584f36bf785f173efd88d0"> Online attacks against women in politics are already <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168018816228">on the rise</a>. Four out of five <a href="https://www.ipu.org/news/news-in-brief/2022-11/violence-against-women-parliamentarians-causes-effects-solutions-0">female parliamentarians</a> have been subjected to psychological violence such as bullying, intimidation, verbal abuse, or harassment, while more than 40% have been threatened with assault, sexual violence, or death. </p>

<p data-line-id="540fdceb7efe4b86af038f976b10d7f3"> CAMBRIDGE – As Western democracies become increasingly polarized, rural and small-town voters are regularly pitted against their counterparts in larger urban centers. While this is not a new phenomenon – and certainly not the only factor affecting voting patterns – the rural-urban divide is a significant driver of today’s culture wars. This dynamic, which economist Andrés Rodríguez-Pose evocatively <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cjres/article-abstract/11/1/189/4821289">described</a> as the “revenge of the places that don’t matter,” suggests that the ongoing populist surge largely reflects geographic disparities. </p><p data-line-id="42ba24d0660a48b7bdc5a6669af32fe9"> How did the rural-urban divide come to dominate <a href="https://www.electoralgeography.com/new/en/">so many countries</a>’ political discourse and development, and how can we address it? Part of the answer lies in structural economic shifts that have made urban living more lucrative. In today’s knowledge-based economy, where value is increasingly derived from intangible sources, gathering people in densely populated urban areas often results in positive spillovers, creating so-called “<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9931/w9931.pdf">economies of agglomeration</a>” that offset the inconveniences of city life. While cities have clusters of low-paid service jobs and pockets of severe poverty, they are magnets for highly paid professionals and university graduates. </p><p data-line-id="8f92e1157d4042cfb7c4025d632769fb"> The economic upheavals of the past 15 years – the Great Recession of 2008-09, fiscal austerity, the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, and the inflationary surge of 2022 – have accelerated this trend. People living in “places that don’t matter” have seen quality jobs disappear, public services eroded, and their economic prospects rapidly diminish. Seen in this light, today’s populist backlash is hardly surprising, especially when many politicians are part of the thriving urban elite. </p>

After Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, then-President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/barack-obama-russia-regional-power-ukraine-weakness">dismissed</a> it as a “regional power” displaying its own weakness. And following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, the apparent assumption was that Russia – and Vladimir Putin’s regime – would quickly crumble under the weight of Western sanctions. </p><p data-line-id="dfc65616a3094883b6aaa744c7ce7a0e"> Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-irrational-invasion-of-ukraine-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2022-02">fueled by delusion</a>. But that does not mean that the West’s assessment of the situation was sensible. On the contrary, most Western observers seemed to be able to imagine just two scenarios: either Putin takes Kyiv in a matter of days, turning Ukraine into a Kremlin puppet, or Russia is quickly defeated, forcing Putin to withdraw his troops and recognize Ukraine’s territorial integrity. </p>

<p data-line-id="c8c629dfb58046d891ce39f546c92320"> PARIS – The ongoing war in Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza following Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack must not distract the world from our collective priorities: reducing our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050, preserving biodiversity, and fighting poverty and inequality. </p>
<p data-line-id="8e538aa42ca04481a3c21e322b581d30"> This is the doctrine France is implementing at an international level, through the Paris Pact for People and the Planet and the One Planet summits. The cornerstone of our strategy must be to speed up the ecological transition as well as the fight against poverty. After all, it is now crystal clear that no country will work to protect the planet if the price it must pay leads its citizens into a socioeconomic dead-end. </p>
<p data-line-id="48b66e504f694eab9c63c8a7d6cc60b8"> The world’s most advanced economies, which have also been the main CO<sub>2</sub> emitters since the industrial revolution, must move away from fossil fuels. If we want to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, this is nonnegotiable. </p>
<p data-line-id="589269fa144149e4971f783d9b1a292f"> Science has set the trajectory: we must move away from coal by 2030, from oil by 2045, and from gas by 2050. While the G7 countries bear the greatest responsibility, China, which is now the second-largest emitter in history, must be fully committed, too. </p>
<p data-line-id="7bbc41781dd44921bf039ce184b38609"> The threat posed by coal must be addressed first. Today, the 2,000 gigawatts of installed capacity emit enough CO<sub>2</sub> to take us above 1.5°C. While the International Energy Agency recommends withdrawing 92 GW per year, 500 GW of additional capacity is already planned. </p>
<p data-line-id="557ddf177a4746daac6ce5f3c9a2ab47"> While it is the G7’s responsibility to move away from coal by 2030 (France will have done so in 2027), emerging economies are now the biggest coal consumers. In these countries, we need to speed up the financing of renewables, as well as nuclear power, which, as a manageable and a decarbonized energy source, must play a key role. </p>
<p data-line-id="e08847bfd7674f77a915e57e4a4b6532"> We must also put private financing and trade at the service of the Paris agreement. The cost of investment must be higher for players in the fossil-fuel sector. We need a green interest rate and a brown interest rate. Similarly, we need a climate clause in our trade agreements, because we cannot simultaneously demand that our industries become greener while supporting the liberalization of international trade in polluting products. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c9e1c2f1bad492d9874a80d3297eb8b"> For the most vulnerable countries, we must create conditions that enable them to finance their climate-change mitigation and adaptation efforts and access the green technologies that are the new engines of growth. This implies going further than traditional “official development assistance” and doing for vulnerable countries what rich countries did for themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic: pursue an unorthodox fiscal and monetary policy.  </p>
<p data-line-id="5bddbd3840ad4a3faafa893797138925"> The results are already there: in two years, following the initiative we took in Paris in the spring of 2021, we have released over $100 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs, the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset) for vulnerable countries. By activating this “dormant asset,” we are extending 20-year loans at near-zero interest rates to finance climate action and pandemic preparedness in the poorest countries. We have begun to change debt rules to suspend payments for such countries, should a climate shock occur. And we have changed the mandate of multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, so that they take more risks and mobilize more private money. </p>
<p data-line-id="f32ba1f74d7740339d86921365481380"> We are going to continue working on this, including within the framework of the new <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-cop27-loss-and-damage-fund">loss and damage fund</a>, where we must mobilize new private insurance mechanisms in the face of climate risk. We will start from the specific needs of the hardest-hit countries. In the first half of 2024, France and Bangladesh will sign an agreement to finance climate-change adaptation and loss and damage, with the French development agency contributing €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in investment, and the IMF extending up to $1 billion worth of SDRs in new loans.  </p>
<p data-line-id="5a96d89fa0674287bf12db45cf069a44"> This also implies identifying, on a global scale, governance mechanisms for the most crucial challenges we will have to face in the coming years, access to water being one of the most pressing. In this regard, France and Kazakhstan will convene a One Water Summit during the United Nations General Assembly in September 2024.  </p>
<p data-line-id="28f3fb1143dd463b9d34ac4c95074bd9"> Moreover, we must focus on building the basis of a “bio-economy” that will pay for the services provided by nature. Nature is our best technology to sequester carbon on a large scale. The countries with the most important carbon and biodiversity reserves, especially in the three main tropical forest basins, must obtain much greater resources, determined on a country-by-country basis, in exchange for their stewardship of these vital reserves. France has already launched three contracts of this type at COP28, with Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>
<p data-line-id="e47b57ef227245959ab1b5b349c41005"> But reform of the voluntary carbon market is essential. We need to create an international carbon and biodiversity exchange that will allow governmental and private actors to organize voluntary carbon credit swaps, based on sufficiently ambitious criteria to avoid greenwashing, and to remunerate local communities.  </p>
<p data-line-id="bf0fef94f9794073980694bba2cff39c"> The ocean is our most important carbon sink, and we must protect it. France and Costa Rica will convene the third United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice in June 2025, with the aim of updating international law, including on the prohibition of plastic pollution and on protection of the deep sea and seabed. These reforms would also enable the development of national strategies for seaboard protection by countries with exclusive economic zones. </p>
<p data-line-id="54b8581944114cf3a864bdae7f11fb12"> Finally, we will not succeed if we cannot reform the World Bank and the IMF, which play a prominent role in establishing the norms and financing the green transition on a global scale. Eighty years after their creation, these institutions remain underfunded, relative to the size of the global economy and population, and emerging and developing countries continue to be shut out of their governance. But we will not be able to agree on goals and financing until every country negotiating is on an equal footing. To this end, we must review Bretton Woods governance, and ask emerging countries to assume their share of accountability in financing global public goods.  </p>

<p data-line-id="a9c3d930783e4831bdb132692a11df49"> NEW YORK – The International Economic Association (IEA) recently concluded its <a href="https://ieawc2023.org/">20th World Congress</a> in Medellín, Colombia. This triennial event brings together scholars from all over the world to share and discuss the latest developments in economic thinking. This year’s edition underscored the urgency of re-evaluating some of the field’s core assumptions. The rapidly escalating debt crisis in the Global South, while not a direct focus of the conference, cast a shadow over it. </p><p data-line-id="04be589bb55a482a8b334154b0a0f2ef"> The IEA was founded in 1950, with Joseph Schumpeter chosen to be its first president. Since then, the organization has been led by some of the world’s most renowned economists, including Paul Samuelson, János Kornai, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/kenneth-j-arrow">Kenneth J. Arrow</a>, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/amartya-sen">Amartya Sen</a>, and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-e-stiglitz">Joseph E. Stiglitz</a>. With the world economy increasingly strained by supply-chain disruptions related to the war in Ukraine, the lingering consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the fighting between Israel and Hamas, this year’s Congress has thrown these daunting challenges into sharp relief. </p><p data-line-id="eea59b7938dc4bfa9cda431dea3522ea"> As the global economy undergoes a fundamental transformation, some of the deeply held assumptions economists have relied on to model it must evolve, too. Unsurprisingly, many of the presentations during this year’s Congress focused on the impact of digital technologies and social media on labor, wages, and inequality. Others focused on the changing nature of globalization, the shift from a unipolar to a multipolar economic order, and the erosion of democratic institutions amid the rise of populist nationalism. </p>

<p data-line-id="fa4c5881977a48d8b238fd981299addf"> MADRID – It has been an eventful year, to put it mildly. In fact, the world has endured so much war, disruption, tension, and uncertainty that we are left to wonder whether the rules-based global order, which has guided international relations since World War II, will survive for much longer. </p><p data-line-id="859d3388bf6b405abcd179fb66069b53"> The post-war international order is not perfect, not least because it remains dominated by its leaders and architects: Europe and, especially, the United States. But one should not underestimate the value of a global system that both rests on and perpetuates liberal values, particularly the rule of law. And that system now appears to be in danger, as these values are attacked, undermined, and eroded. </p><p data-line-id="52d947b02ce646628699e0886c4ccf4a"> According to the United Nations, the rule of law <a href="https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/what-is-the-rule-of-law/">demands</a> that every person, institution, and entity, “including the state itself,” is accountable to laws that are “publicly promulgated, equally enforced,” “independently adjudicated,” and “consistent with international human-rights norms and standards.” But three main forces are increasingly preventing this standard from being met. </p>
